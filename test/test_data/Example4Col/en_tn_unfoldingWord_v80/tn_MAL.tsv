front:intro	axt4				0	# Introduction to Malachi\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Malachi\n\n1. The word of Yahweh comes to Israel (1:1)\n1. Yahweh loves Israel and rejects Esau (Edom) (1:2–5)\n1. A message against the priests (1:6–2:9)\n1. A message against Judah: they have broken faith by divorcing and intermarrying (2:10–16)\n1. A message about the day of refining (2:17–3:6)\n1. A message about tithing (3:7–12)\n1. A message about those who others treated shamefully, but who were faithful to Yahweh (3:13–18)\n1. Yahweh will punish the wicked and send Elijah before the “great and terrible day of Yahweh” (4:5–6)\n\n### What is the Book of Malachi about?\n\nThe Book of Malachi is about the prophecies that Malachi spoke to the Jews who had returned from Babylon to Judah. At that time, the Jews were discouraged even though they had finished building a new temple. The wonderful things that previous prophets had promised for Judah had not yet happened. And the Persian Empire still ruled over them. As a result, they no longer were concerned about the law or worshiping Yahweh. Malachi rebuked them for not trusting in Yahweh. But he also promised them that Yahweh would do everything that he promised to do.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has been titled “Malachi” or “The Book of Malachi.” Translators may decide to call it “The Book about Malachi” or “The Sayings of Malachi.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Malachi?\n\nThe prophet Malachi wrote these messages from Yahweh to the Jews. However, since “Malachi” means “my messenger,” it is possible that this was a title for this prophet. If so, we do not know his real name.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was meant by the day of Yahweh?\n\nMalachi spoke about “the day” several times. This is the same as “the day of Yahweh.” In the Book of Malachi, this is the time when Yahweh would judge his people. He would remove those who wickedly sin and bless those who trust in him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\nSeveral rhetorical questions are used in this chapter to convince the reader of the truth of what he is saying and of their sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

God’s power to judge the people and to stop them from sinning is spoken of as if it were the power of strong soap to clean clothes, or the power of fire to melt an object. These are ways of saying that God’s power to do these things cannot be stopped. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
3:3	bxz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he will purify the sons of Levi	0	Forgiving the sons of Levi and persuading them not to sin any longer is spoken of as if it were purifying metal.
