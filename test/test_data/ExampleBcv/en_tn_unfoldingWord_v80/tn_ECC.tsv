front:intro	d82s				0	# Introduction to Ecclesiastes\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of Ecclesiastes\n\n1. The author questions the nature of life and the limits of human wisdom (1:1–6:12)\n1. The author teaches about making wise choices in how one lives (7:1–12:7)\n1. The conclusion and ending (12:8–14)\n\n### What is the Book of Ecclesiastes about?\n\nEcclesiastes is a group of short teachings that try to answer questions such as “What do people gain from all their labor?” Ecclesiastes is a series of thoughts about a variety of subjects, all of them about the purpose and worth of various actions and events. The author concludes that all the work we perform and all the knowledge and skill we gain is like a vapor that disappears, and that we must fear Yahweh and keep his commandments.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe traditional title for this book is “Ecclesiastes.” Its meaning is similar to “religious assembly.” Translators might decide on a title that better describes the content of the book, such as “Words of a Teacher” or “Teachings of a Wise Man.”\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Ecclesiastes?\n\nThe author appears to be Solomon, “the Teacher, the descendant of David and king in Jerusalem.” This is consistent with what Solomon was known for:\n* his wisdom ([Ecclesiastes 1:16](../../ecc/01/16.md) and twenty-six other references to wisdom);\n* his vast wealth ([Ecclesiastes 2:8](../../ecc/02/08.md)), and the pain that comes from wealth ([Ecclesiastes 5:13-14](../05/13.md); [Ecclesiastes 4:8](../../ecc/04/08.md); and [Ecclesiastes 9:11](../../ecc/09/11.md));\n* his large number of servants ([Ecclesiastes 2:7](../../ecc/02/07.md) and [Ecclesiastes 10:7](../../ecc/10/07.md));\n* his limitless opportunities for worldly pleasures ([Ecclesiastes 2:1-2](../02/01.md), [Ecclesiastes 10](../02/09.md); [Ecclesiastes 3:13](../../ecc/03/13.md); [Ecclesiastes 4:8](../../ecc/04/08.md); [Ecclesiastes 5:4](../../ecc/05/04.md); and [Ecclesiastes 12:1](../../ecc/12/01.md)); and\n* the wide range of his many building projects ([Ecclesiastes 2:4-6](../02/04.md)).\n\nSolomon appears to have written the Book of Ecclesiastes near the end of his life, as he reflected on what he gained from all that he did.\n\n### Why are there so many apparent contradictions in the Book of Ecclesiastes?\n\nSome scholars think the author was a faithful man. Other scholars think that the author made bad decisions and was sorrowful when he wrote this book. Apparent contradictions in the book may indicate that Solomon’s faith was sometimes weak. Or, it is also possible that the teachings in the book differ from each other in order to relate to different things happening in the lives of readers.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What does this book teach about how God repays people?\n\nIn the ancient Near East, people were concerned with why they were being punished or blessed. They often connected these things to their gods. The writer of Ecclesiastes explains that Yahweh will bless and reward people for the right things they do and punish people for the evil things they do. But this might not happen in this life. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])\n\n### What value did the Israelites place on the Book of Ecclesiastes?\n\nThe Israelites have often questioned the value of this book. This is due in large part to its unusual wording and teachings. At times, it appears to disagree with the rest of Scripture. While many have questioned its authority, it has been affirmed to be Scripture. It gives valuable lessons concerning the uselessness of pursuing any goal other than to give Yahweh glory.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What is the meaning of “under the sun?”\n\n“Under the sun” here is another way of saying “on the earth.” When the author says that there is “nothing new under the sun,” this means that every kind of thing has already happened before on the earth. While a particular event may not have specifically occurred before, something similar has already occurred.\n\n### How do I translate harsh or shocking passages?\n\nParts of the Book of Ecclesiastes can be shocking or surprising to read in Scripture. For example, “If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but if his heart is not satisfied with good and he is not buried with honor, then I say that a baby that is born dead is better off than he is” (6:3). The translator should allow these difficulties to remain and not try to make them less surprising.\n\n### How is life described in the Book of Ecclesiastes?\n\nThe author of Ecclesiastes concludes that everything in this life quickly passes away, like a vapor that disappears. A person’s circumstances or character and even all of the things of this world have little or no significance apart from God. That is because God gives meaning to everything.\n\nAt the end of their life, people often say that the years of their life seemed short. The author of Ecclesiastes used the metaphor of vapor or breath to describe how life ends while it seems to be just beginning.
