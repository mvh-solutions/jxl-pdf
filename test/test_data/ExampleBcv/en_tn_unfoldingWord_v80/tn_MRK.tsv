front:intro	r2f2				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Mark\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–13)\n2. Jesus’ early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n3. Jesus teaches and performs miracles (3:7–6:6)\n4. Jesus expands his ministry and encounters opposition (6:7–8:21)\n5. Jesus instructs his disciples and journeys toward Jerusalem (8:22–10:52)\n6. Jesus in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n7. Jesus’ last days and death (14:1–15:47)\n8. Jesus’ resurrection (16:1–8)\n\n### What is the book of Mark about?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Mark wrote much about what Jesus did and how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles. Many Christians believe that this Gospel was the first one to be written.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel According to Mark.” Or they may choose a different title, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Mark?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark, also known as John Mark. This Mark did not know Jesus during his life on earth, and he did not witness the events that he writes about in this Gospel. However, he was a close friend of the Apostle Peter. Most likely, Mark recorded what Peter said about Jesus and then wrote this Gospel based on that eyewitness testimony.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What does the phrase “the kingdom of God” mean?\n\nMark refers to “the kingdom of God” 14 times. This phrase is both important and difficult to translate. In general, the word “kingdom” refers to a monarch ruling over a group of people in a specific area. In various contexts, the word can primarily emphasize the area, the people, or the ruling. However, the term usually refers to all three of these elements, even if one is emphasized more than the others. Consider how you might express the idea of “kingdom” in your language. Some translations emphasize the idea of ruling and express the idea with a clause like “God ruling as king” or “God’s reign.” Other translations emphasize the idea of the people who are ruled and express the idea with a clause like “belonging to God’s people.” However, both of these options do not fully express the idea of “kingdom.” If you have a word or phrase that describes a situation in which a king rules over people in a specific area, you could use it here. Since that word in English is “kingdom,” the ULT and UST both use “kingdom.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/kingdom]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])\n\n### What were “disciples” in Jesus’ culture?\n\nIn both Jewish culture and in Greco-Roman culture, teachers had “disciples” who learned from them and were committed to them. Sometimes these disciples would go wherever their teacher went and imitate what the teacher did. Jesus’ disciples similarly were committed to him and learned from him. Some of his closest disciples traveled and lived with Jesus, particularly those whom Mark refers to as The Twelve. Other disciples would go to see Jesus and learn from him, but they did not always travel or live with him. Consider how you might refer to these kinds of relationships in your language. The ULT expresses the idea with the word “disciple,” and the UST uses the word “apprentice.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase can express two primary ideas:\n\n1. It can refer to someone who is a human. This meaning for the phrase appears frequently in the book of Ezekiel (for example, see [Ezekiel 2:1](../ezk/02/01.md) or [Ezekiel 47:6](../ezk/47/06.md)). So, Jesus uses the phrase to refer to himself in the third person while identifying himself as a human being.\n2. It can refer more specifically to a specific person who appears in [Daniel 7:13–14](../dan/07/13.md). This person approaches God, who gives him dominion and authority. So, when he uses the phrase, Jesus is identifying himself with this person. Scholars are not sure whether people in Jesus’ culture used the title “Son of Man” to refer to the Messiah. However, Jesus is probably using the title to implicitly claim a special role, perhaps that of the Messiah.\n\nThere are three primary issues to consider when translating the phrase “the Son of Man”:\n\n1. When Jesus uses the phrase, he is referring to himself in the third person. If your readers would not understand this, you may need to express the idea in the first person. See the notes on the phrase “the Son of Man” throughout the book for ways to do this.\n2. The phrase figuratively refers to someone who is human by identifying that person’s father as a “man.” If that figure of speech does not make sense in your language, you could refer to someone who is human in another way. Some translations use a phrase like “the human one” to express the idea.\n3. The phrase refers to the specific figure from the book of Daniel. If you have a translation of the book of Daniel, you could translate the phrase as it is expressed there. If you do not have a translation of the book of Daniel, you could consider translating the phrase as a title that refers to a special person, implicitly the Messiah. You could make this clear by capitalizing the phrase (for example, “the Human One”) or by using a different form that indicates that this is a title (for example, “the one called Son of Man”).\n\nA note related to translating the idea of “Son of Man” appears at its first occurrence. After that, if possible express the idea consistently throughout the rest of the book. Notes providing translation options for expressing the idea in first person instead of third person appear at every occurrence. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. The ULT represents these parallels by using the same words whenever the parallel passages are exactly the same. When the parallel passages are slightly different, the ULT represents the differences as much as possible by using different words. Make sure that your translation represents these similarities and differences as closely as possible.\n\n### Why does Mark use the word “immediately” so frequently?\n\nMark uses the word “immediately” 42 times. Most likely, he does this to make his narration more exciting and vivid. It is not always clear how close together events connected by the word “immediately” are. Because of that, it is best to use a general word or phrase that indicates that something happens soon after something else. If possible, express the idea with the same word or phrase throughout the book. The UST often expresses the idea with the phrase “as soon as.”\n\n### When is “you” singular, and when is “you” plural?\n\nAs he is telling his story, Mark uses both singular and plural forms of “you.” These were distinct in his language, but in English both singular and plural are expressed with the word “you.” So, in the introduction to each chapter, there is a section stating whether Mark uses the singular or plural form of “you” more frequently in that chapter. Then, notes throughout the chapter will indicate whenever Mark uses the less frequent form of “you.” Look for this section in each chapter introduction if your language distinguishes between singular and plural forms of “you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Why does Mark uses present tense verbs for actions that happened in the past?\n\nThroughout this book, Mark often uses present tense verbs to refer to actions that happened in the past. Sometimes he uses a present tense verb in the same sentence with past tense verbs. He does this particularly frequently with verbs that introduce speech. Scholars debate why Mark uses these present tense verbs. Most likely, he included them to highlight or call attention to the action that they describe. In other words, when Mark uses a present tense verb in past narration, he probably does so in order to make his readers pay attention. If present tense verbs in past narration would not accomplish this goal in your language, you could use past tense verbs in your translation and draw the attention of your readers in another way. Since Mark uses these present tense verbs frequently, there are not translation notes at each occurrence. Instead, each chapter introduction lists the verses in which Mark uses present tense verbs in this way. Make sure that your translation deals with this issue consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Mark?\n\nSome versions of the Bible include some verses in Matthew that other versions do not include. This is because some ancient manuscripts include these verses. However, the best ancient manuscripts do not include them. Here are the verses:\n\n* “If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear” ([7:16](../07/16.md)).\n* “where their worm does not end, and the fire is not quenched” ([9:44](../09/44.md)).\n* “where their worm does not end, and the fire is not quenched” ([9:44](../09/44.md)).\n* “But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in the heavens forgive your trespasses” ([11:26](../11/26.md)).\n* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “And he was counted with lawless ones’” ([15:28](../15/28.md)).\n\nIt is recommended that you do not include these passages. However, if in your region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, you may include them. If they are included, they should be put in footnotes or inside square brackets to indicate that they were probably not originally part of Matthew.\n\nFurther, the manuscripts that scholars consider to be the most reliable do not include the words in [16:9–20](../16/09.md). So, the ULT and UST put these words in brackets, and there are no translation notes on these verses. It is recommended that you also indicate in some way that Mark probably did not write these words. See the introduction to chapter 16 for more information.\n\nFinally, in the following verses, ancient manuscripts do not all have the same words. The ULT uses the words that are found in most of the earliest manuscripts. When you translate these verses, you should compare the ULT with any translations with which your readers may be familiar to see what your readers may expect. Unless there is a good reason to use the alternate words, you should follow the ULT. See the footnotes and notes at each of these verses for more information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n* “Jesus Christ, the Son of God” ([1:1](../01/01.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Jesus Christ.”\n* “having had compassion” ([1:41](../01/41.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “having become angry.”\n* “he appointed 12, whom he also named apostles” ([3:14](../03/14.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “he appointed 12.”\n* “And he appointed the Twelve, and he added” ([3:16](../03/16.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “And he added.”\n* “guilty of an eternal sin” ([3:29](../03/29.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “deserving of eternal judgment.”\n* “your brothers” ([3:32](../03/32.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “your brothers and your sisters.”\n* “Gerasenes” ([5:1](../05/01.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Gadarenes.” Other manuscripts have this: “Gergesenes.”\n* “for a testimony against them” ([6:11](../06/11.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “for a testimony against them. Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.”\n* “they were saying” ([6:14](../06/14.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “he was saying.”\n* “he was much perplexed” ([6:20](../06/20.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “he was doing many things.”\n* “his daughter, of Herodias” ([6:22](../06/22.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the daughter of Herodias herself.”\n* “copper vessels” ([7:4](../07/04.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “copper vessels and beds.”\n* “the tradition of men” ([7:8](../07/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the tradition of men, washings of pitchers and cups and many other similar such things you do.”\n* “you may keep” ([7:9](../07/09.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “you may establish.”\n* “enter into the town” ([8:26](../08/26.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “enter into the town nor speak to anyone in the town.”\n* “prayer and fasting” ([9:29](../09/29.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “prayer.”\n* “in your name” ([9:38](../09/38.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “in your name, who does not follow us.”\n* “into Gehenna” ([9:45](../09/45.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire.”\n* “salted with fire” ([9:49](../09/49.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt here.”\n* “will leave his father and mother” ([10:7](../10/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife.”\n* “follow me” ([10:21](../10/21.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “follow me, having taken up the cross.”\n* “how hard it is” ([10:24](../10/24.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “how hard it is for the ones trusting in riches.”\n* “saying to him” ([10:26](../10/26.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “saying to themselves.”\n* “he sends it back” ([11:3](../11/03.md)).

1:intro	c6ep				0	# Mark 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–13)\n      * Opening (1:1–3)\n      * The ministry of John the Baptist (1:4–8)\n      * Jesus is baptized and tempted (1:9–13)\n2. Jesus’ early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n      * Jesus calls four disciples (1:14–20)\n      * Jesus teaches and casts out a demon (1:21–28)\n      * Jesus heals Simon’s mother-in-law and many others (1:29–34)\n      * Jesus teaches and heals people throughout Galilee (1:35–39)\n      * Jesus heals a leper (1:40–45)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:2–3](../01/02.md), which is made up of quotations from [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md) and [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Baptism\n\nThe word “baptism” refers to a ritual washing, usually with water. John’s baptism is similar to Christian baptism, but it does not mean exactly the same thing (see [Acts 18:24–26](../act/18/24.md)). Mark writes that John’s baptism is “of repentance” (see [1:4](../01/04.md)). Most likely, it symbolized the removal of the sins that people were repenting of and the beginning of a new way of living. However, even Jesus received this baptism despite the fact that he did not need to repent of any sins. In this case, the baptism may symbolize complete dedication to God. Consider how you might refer to this kind of ritual washing in your language.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that John the Baptist delivers to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 12, 21, 30, 37, 38, 40, 41, and 44. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
1:1-4	ewhd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ & καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ: ἰδοὺ, ἀποστέλλω τὸν ἄγγελόν μου πρὸ προσώπου σου, ὃς κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου & φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ & ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης	1	Here, the phrase **Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet** and the quotation that follows could go with: (1) verse 1: **The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God**. In this case, Mark means that the**gospel** had its **beginning** just as Isaiah prophesied. Alternate translation: “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, happened just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way; a voice crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.’” And so John came” (2) verse 4: **John came**. In this case, Mark means that **John came** as Isaiah had prophesied. Alternate translation: “This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Just as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, “Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way; a voice crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight,’” John came”
1:1	ybv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀρχὴ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **beginning**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Here begins the gospel”
1:1	kpq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ εὐαγγελίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Mark is using the possessive form to describe a **gospel** that is about **Jesus Christ**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “of the gospel concerning Jesus Christ”
1:1	i3bc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ	1	**Son of God** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship with God the Father.
1:1	et9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Υἱοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Many ancient manuscripts include the phrase **the Son of God**. The ULT follows that reading. A few ancient manuscripts do not include these words. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
1:2	e3by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	In Mark’s culture, **Just as it has been written in Isaiah the prophet** is a normal way to introduce quotations from important texts, in this case, the Old Testament books written by the prophet Malachi and by **Isaiah the prophet** (see [Malachi 3:1](../mal/03/01.md) and [Isaiah 40:3](../isa/40/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from important texts. Alternate translation: “Just as you can read in what Isaiah the prophet wrote” or “Just as it says in the Scriptures connected with Isaiah the prophet”\n
1:2	fc4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Just as Isaiah the prophet wrote”
1:2	z8b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1	Here, **Isaiah the prophet** represents the book written by Isaiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the scroll of Isaiah the prophet”
1:2	br10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: “See” or “Pay attention”
1:2	gu7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	Here, the phrase **before your face** means before or in front of the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in front of you” or “before I send you”
1:2	kl12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks of helping people to get ready for the coming of the Messiah as if it were preparing the **way** or road for the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will help people get ready for you to arrive”
1:3	cf0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1	The author of the quotation is using **voice** to represent a person speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a person calling out” or “someone calling out”
1:3	lkm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ,	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “of one calling out in the wilderness and saying” or “of one calling out in the wilderness, declaring”
1:3	dqi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. If you do, you will need to delete the single quotation mark at the end of this quotation. Alternate translation: “the wilderness that people must make ready the way of the Lord, that they must make his paths straight”
1:3	v3n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a connecting word in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Make ready the way of the Lord, yes, make his paths straight”
1:3	peh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if people should build or maintain roads for **the Lord** to travel on as he comes to visit his people. He means that people need to be living and acting in proper ways when **the Lord** appears to his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the metaphor in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Live and behave in a way that pleases God, as if you were making a road ready for him to travel on”
1:3	tz2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἑτοιμάσατε & ποιεῖτε	1	Because the person who is **crying out** is speaking to many people, the commands **Make ready** and **make** are plural.
1:4	pmse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης, ὁ βαπτίζων ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ κηρύσσων	1	Here, the phrase translated **the one baptizing** could be: (1) a description of what John did, in parallel with the word **preaching**. Alternate translation: “John came. He was baptizing in the wilderness and preaching” (2) a title (“the Baptist”) that people called **John**. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist came in the wilderness, preaching”
1:4	je3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐγένετο Ἰωάννης	1	This phrase introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “There was a man named John” or “A man called John appeared”
1:4	q9np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “preaching, ‘Receive a baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.’”
1:4	s05n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας	1	Here Mark implies that John was **preaching** that people should undergo **a baptism of repentance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “preaching that people should receive a baptism of repentance” or “preaching that people should ask to receive a baptism of repentance”
1:4	dtqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **repentance** and **forgiveness**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “that people should be baptized to show that they had repented, so that their sins would be forgiven”\n
1:4	vz74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	βάπτισμα μετανοίας	1	Here, Mark is using the possessive form to describe a **baptism** that shows or expresses **repentance**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a baptism that expresses repentance” or “a baptism that demonstrates repentance”
1:4	p86z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	Here, the phrase **for the forgiveness of sins** indicates the goal of the **baptism of repentance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that indicates the goal of an action. Alternate translation: “that would lead to forgiveness of sins”
1:5	cf75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα καὶ οἱ Ἱεροσολυμεῖται πάντες	1	Mark twice writes **all** as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “most of the Judea region and most of the Jerusalemites”
1:5	u9yg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα	1	Here, the phrase **all the Judea region** represents the people who live in that area.

Jesus’ early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n      * Jesus heals a paralytic (2:1–12)\n      * Jesus calls Levi and dines at his house (2:13–17)\n      * Jesus brings something new (2:18–22)\n      * Picking heads of grain on the Sabbath (2:22–28)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nWhen Mark uses the word “sinners,” he is describing a group of people whom many Jewish religious groups would have considered to be living in ways that were improper for those who were part of God’s people. Some of these people may have committed significant sins, while others may have disagreed with many of the Jewish religious groups about how Jews could properly behave. If possible, use a word or phrase that identifies people who are not living as many religious groups think that people should live. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Fasting and feasting\n\nIn Jesus’ culture, people would “fast,” or abstain from eating for a period of time, in order to honor God or to repent of their sins. They would “feast,” or eat a lot of food, when they were celebrating some important event, such as a wedding. Consider how you will refer to these behaviors in [2:15–22](../02/15.md), in which Jesus feasts and teaches about why he and his disciples do not fast. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])\n\n### The Sabbath\n\nIn the law that God gave to Moses, God commanded the Israelites to rest on the seventh day, which was called the Sabbath. The Jewish religious leaders disagreed with each other about what kinds of things a person could do on the Sabbath and still rest as God had commanded. In [2:22–28](../02/22.md), the Pharisees and Jesus engage in these kinds of debates about the Sabbath. Jesus disagrees with how the Pharisees understand the Sabbath, and he argues for a different view. If your readers may not understand what the Sabbath is and why Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about it, you may need to include some information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The short parables in [2:19–22](../02/19.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus gives three short parables that emphasize how certain things do not go well together. Fasting does not happen during a wedding celebration. An unshrunk piece of cloth does not make a good patch for an old garment. Old wineskins do not make good containers for fresh wine that still needs to ferment. Jesus tells these parables to illustrate how his ministry and preaching do not match well with how people had previously done things. In other words, Jesus wants people to expect what he does to be new, and this may require thinking and doing many new things. You should preserve these parables, since they are not direct metaphors. If necessary, you could introduce them in such a way that your readers recognize that they are parables or illustrations. See the notes on each verse for possible translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 18, 25. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
2:1	j6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δι’ ἡμερῶν	1	Here, the phrase **after {some} days** indicates that the events Mark is about to narrate occurred a few, but not very many, days after the event he just narrated, the healing of the leper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that indicates that a few **days** passed between the previous event and this event. Alternate translation: “a few days later”
2:1	ir5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠκούσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was people who were in **Capernaum**. Alternate translation: “the people there heard”
2:1	afvi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν οἴκῳ	1	Here Mark implies that this **house** was Jesus’ home while he was in Capernaum. This **house** could belong to: (1) Simon and Andrew, since he stayed at their house previously (see [1:29](../01/29.md)). Alternate translation: “in Simon and Andrew’s house” (2) Jesus and his relatives, who may have moved to Capernaum. Alternate translation: “in his house”
2:2	zja1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὶ	1	Mark is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many men and women”
2:2	pv8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνήχθησαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “gathered” or “came together”\n
2:2	m8pw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μηκέτι χωρεῖν	1	Here, the clause **it could no longer receive** means that the house was so full that no one else could fit inside. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “there was no space left” or “no one else could fit”
2:2	ilsu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲ τὰ πρὸς τὴν θύραν	1	Here Mark means that there were so many people even outside the house that no one could get near **the door**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “and no one could even get to the door” or “and there was no space even at the door into the house”
2:2	zkka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Mark is using the term **word** to mean the gospel, that Jesus preached using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the gospel”
2:3	sotm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔρχονται φέροντες πρὸς αὐτὸν παραλυτικὸν, αἰρόμενον ὑπὸ τεσσάρων	1	Here Mark could be implying that: (1) more than four people came, but only **four** of them were carrying the paralytic. Alternate translation: “people come bringing to him a paralytic, being carried by four of them” (2) **four** people came and were carrying the paralytic. Alternate translation: “four men come bringing to him a paralytic, whom they were carrying”
2:3	h1t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχονται	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “they go”
2:3	s21g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	παραλυτικὸν	1	A **paralytic** is someone who is not able to use or control some or all of his or her arms and legs because of injury or sickness. If your readers would not be familiar with this sickness, you could use the name of something like this in your language, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a paralyzed person” or “a person who could not move his limbs”
2:3	k1ev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αἰρόμενον ὑπὸ τεσσάρων	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom four men were carrying”
2:3	i2wu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αἰρόμενον	1	As the next verse states, the **four men** carried the **paralytic** on a “mat.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea explicit here. Alternate translation: “being carried on a mat”
2:4	gbvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	μὴ δυνάμενοι προσενέγκαι αὐτῷ διὰ τὸν ὄχλον	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “when, because of the crowd, they were not able to bring to him”
2:4	i44b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσενέγκαι αὐτῷ	1	Here Mark implies that they were not able to **bring** the paralytic to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to bring the paralytic to Jesus”
2:4	v6ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀπεστέγασαν τὴν στέγην ὅπου ἦν, καὶ ἐξορύξαντες, χαλῶσι	1	In the region where Jesus lived, houses usually had flat roofs that could be reached by staircases on the outside of the houses. These roofs were usually made of wooden beams, branches, and packed dirt or clay. Here Mark describes how these people **dug** through the branches and clay to create a hole in the roof through which they could lower the paralytic on his mat. If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of roof, you could use descriptive phrases, or you could use more general terms. Alternate translation: “they demolished the part of the flat roof above where he was, and having dug a hole in it, they lower” or “they cut a hole in the roof and lower through it”
2:4	rrvf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἐξορύξαντες	1	Here Mark uses the phrase **having dug {it} out** to indicate that they finished making a hole before they lowered the man down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this sequence more explicitly. Alternate translation: “once they had dug it out” or “after digging it out”
2:4	q22b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπεστέγασαν τὴν στέγην ὅπου ἦν	1	Here Mark implies that they first climbed up onto **the roof** before they **removed** it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “they climbed onto the roof of the house where he was and removed it”
2:4	ouxr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κράβαττον	1	A **mat** was a portable bed that could also be used to transport a person. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of bed, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a stretcher”
2:4	b32f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ παραλυτικὸς	1	See how you translated the word **paralytic** in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “the paralyzed person” or “the person who could not move his limbs”
2:5	trg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰδὼν & τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus recognized that the friends of this paralyzed man strongly believed that he could heal him. Their actions proved that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having recognized that they were convinced that he could heal the paralytic”
2:5	u57m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how they trusted”
2:5	kuvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ παραλυτικῷ	1	See how you translated the word paralytic in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “to the paralyzed person” or “to the person who could not move his limbs”
2:5	hzg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνον	1	Here Jesus calls the paralytic **Child** to indicate that he cares for him. The word also implies that the paralytic was younger than Jesus. The paralytic was not actually Jesus’ son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form of address that an older person would use to show that they care for a younger person. Alternate translation: “My friend” or “Young one”\n
2:5	lix5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνται σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:6	ihb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces something that was happening while Jesus was speaking to the paralytic. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that happened at the same time as something that has already been narrated. Alternate translation: “Meanwhile,” or “While that was happening,”
2:6	le6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	In Mark’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **hearts** by referring to the places where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “in their heads” or “within themselves”
2:7	yr5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί οὗτος οὕτως λαλεῖ?	1	The scribes are using the question form to show that they disapprove of how Jesus was speaking. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “It is not right for this one to speak in this way.” or “This one should not be speaking in this way!”
2:7	fp38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	If, in your language, it would appear that the scribes were making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “Only one, God, is able to forgive sins, right?” or “Who is able to forgive sins? It is only God, right?”
2:7	sj6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός?	1	The scribes are using the question form to indicate that they are confident that only God can forgive sins. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one is able to forgive sins except one, God.” or “No one can ever forgive sins except one, God!”
2:8	h3zp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς τῷ πνεύματι αὐτοῦ	1	Here Mark implies that Jesus knew what the scribes were thinking even though they did not say it out loud. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Jesus, having known in his spirit their thoughts,”
2:8	niy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ πνεύματι αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the word **spirit** refers to inner parts of Jesus, the parts where he thought and willed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the inner part of Jesus or to Jesus more generally. Alternate translation: “in his mind” or “in himself”
2:8	wga7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ταῦτα διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the scribes. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “What you are debating in your hearts is wrong.” or “Stop debating in your hearts whether I am blaspheming!”
2:8	vfkd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	διαλογίζεσθε & ὑμῶν	1	Because Jesus is speaking to the scribes, the words **you** and **your** are plural.
2:8	s3m6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	See how you translated **hearts** in [2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: “in your heads” or “within yourselves”
2:9	wv5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν τῷ παραλυτικῷ, ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show the scribes which of these things is **easier** to say. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. He could mean: (1) that saying **Your sins are forgiven** is easier than saying **Get up and take up your mat and walk**. This is because it is easy to show that someone is lying when they try to heal a paralytic, but it is not easy to show that someone is lying when they claim to forgive sins. Alternate translation: “It is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ than to say, ‘Get up and take up your mat and walk.’” (2) that both things are equally easy to say. Alternate translation: “Saying ‘Your sins are forgiven’ is just as easy as saying, ‘Get up and take up your mat and walk.’”\n
2:9	q905		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπεῖν τῷ παραλυτικῷ, ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this sentence so that there are no quotations within a quotation. Alternate translation: “to say to the paralytic that his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and take up his mat and walk”

2:9	aiif		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:9	nmp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸν κράβαττόν σου	1	See how you translated **mat** in [2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “your stretcher”
2:10	cmms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a slight contrast with the comparison in the previous verse. Jesus now shows that he will both forgive and heal the paralytic. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a slight contrast, or you could leave But untranslated. Alternate translation: “But now,” or “Leaving that aside,”
2:10	g4jn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα & εἰδῆτε ὅτι ἐξουσίαν ἔχει ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας, (λέγει τῷ παραλυτικῷ)	1	Here, the phrase **in order that** introduces the purpose for which Jesus **says to the paralytic** the commands that he gives. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that provides the stated purpose for which a person performs an action. Alternate translation: “here is what I will do so that you might know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins.’ Then he says to the paralytic,”\n
2:10	jhy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	εἰδῆτε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to the scribes, the word **you** is plural.
2:10	jsyp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἔχει ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. Alternate translation: “I, who am the Son of Man, have”
2:10	ipgg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus for the first time in Mark uses the title **Son of Man** to refer to himself. He is using the title to refer to himself, a human, and also to implicitly identify himself with the important and powerful figure named “the son of man” in the Old Testament book of Daniel (see [Daniel 7:13–14](../dan/07/13.md)). See the book introduction for more information about this title. Consider how you might best translate this title here and throughout the rest of Mark. Alternate translation: “the Human One” or “the one called Son of Man”
2:10	uedr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξουσίαν ἔχει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “has been authorized”

2:12	la3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἠγέρθη, καὶ εὐθὺς ἄρας τὸν κράβαττον, ἐξῆλθεν	1	The implication is that the man was able to get up because Jesus had healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having been healed, he got up, immediately took up the mat, went out”
2:12	ki94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸν κράβαττον	1	See how you translated **mat** in [2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “the stretcher”

2:13	ma6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

2:13	eaev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξῆλθεν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “came” instead of **went**. Alternate translation: “he came out”
2:13	zecn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἤρχετο	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “going” instead of **coming**. Alternate translation: “was going”

2:14	ekv0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀκολούθει μοι & ἠκολούθησεν αὐτῷ	1	Here, the phrase **Follow me** is a command to travel with Jesus and be his disciple. Similarly, the phrase **he followed him** indicates that Levi did travel with Jesus and become his disciple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Be my disciple … he was his disciple” or “Come with me as my student … he went with him as his student”
2:15	e2bz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καὶ γίνεται	1	Here, the phrase **And it happens {that}** introduces something that happened soon after what Mark previously narrated. If it would be helpful in your language, you use a word or phrase that introduces an event that came soon after the previous event. Alternate translation: “Soon after that,”
2:15	zafq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατακεῖσθαι	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would usually recline, or lay on one side, when they were eating. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the position in which people eat in your culture, or you could just refer to eating. Alternate translation: “was sitting down to eat” or “was eating”
2:15	zqcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces an explanation that gives further information about the people who were dining with Jesus.

2:15	bwv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἠκολούθουν αὐτῷ	1	Here, the phrase **they were following him** indicates that these people were traveling with Jesus and were his disciple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they were his disciples” or “they were traveling with him as his students”
2:16	rwu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	οἱ γραμματεῖς τῶν Φαρισαίων	1	Here, Mark is using the possessive form to describe **scribes** who were also **Pharisees**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the scribes, ones who were Pharisees” or “some scribes, who were also Pharisees”
2:16	b1bi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὅτι μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν ἐσθίει?	1	The scribes of the Pharisees are using the question form to criticize what Jesus is doing.

This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the following sentence, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you could translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “People who are well do not need to see a doctor, but people who are unwell do”
2:17	c62j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “the ones having sickness have need of a physician”
2:17	lh4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sickness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the ones who are sick”
2:17	re1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἦλθον	1	Here, the word **come** refers to Jesus entering this world as a human to do what God called him to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I did not come to this world” or “I am not acting”
2:17	lgl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	δικαίους	1	Jesus is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun to mean righteous people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “righteous people”
2:17	ca4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλούς	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but I came to call sinners”\n
2:18	j1h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Later,”

2:18	z394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔρχονται	1	The pronoun **they** refers to some people who asked Jesus this question. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use a form that refers to people without identifying who they are. Alternate translation: “certain people come”

Alternate translation: “The disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast. For what reason do your disciples not fast?”
2:19-20	l0f0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν? ὅσον χρόνον ἔχουσιν τὸν νυμφίον μετ’ αὐτῶν, οὐ δύνανται νηστεύειν & ἐλεύσονται δὲ ἡμέραι ὅταν ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος, καὶ τότε νηστεύσουσιν ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	To help the people who asked him the question understand why his disciples do not fast, Jesus offers a brief illustration. He wants them to think of him as if he were a **bridegroom** and of his disciples as if they were the **sons of the bridal chamber**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that Jesus is like the **bridegroom**, and his disciples are like the **sons of the bridal chamber**. Alternate translation: “The sons of the bridal chamber are not able to fast while the bridegroom is still with them, are they? As much time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast. But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and in those days, then they will fast. I am like the bridegroom, and my disciples are like the sons of the bridal chamber.”
2:19	eke3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach the people who asked him the question. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The sons of the bridal chamber are certainly not able to fast while the bridegroom is still with them.” or “The sons of bridal chamber cannot fast while the bridegroom is still with them!”
2:19	wetb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος	1	The expression **sons of** describes people who share the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of being an integral part of a wedding. These are the male friends who attend the groom during the ceremony and the festivities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The groom’s attendants”\n
2:20	y79o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐλεύσονται & ἡμέραι ὅταν & ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	Here Jesus is using the word **days** to refer to a particular time.

2:20	vg2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπαρθῇ & ὁ νυμφίος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone will take the bridegroom away”
2:20	vfc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τότε & ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	The expression **in those days, then** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “in those days”
2:21	vdza		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	οὐδεὶς ἐπίβλημα ῥάκους ἀγνάφου ἐπιράπτει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν; εἰ δὲ μή αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ, τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ, καὶ χεῖρον σχίσμα γίνεται.	1	To help the people who asked the question understand why his disciples do not fast, Jesus offers another brief illustration. He wants them to think of the new things that he teaches and does as **a patch of unshrunk cloth** and of the current ways of doing things as if they were **an old garment**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that what Jesus does and teaches is like the **patch of unshrunk cloth**, and the normal way of doing things is like **an old garment**. Alternate translation: “no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, but if not, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear happens. What I say and do is like the unshrunk cloth, and the normal way of doing things is like an old garment.”\n
2:21	v6xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδεὶς ἐπίβλημα ῥάκους ἀγνάφου ἐπιράπτει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν	1	Here Jesus refers to the practice of patching a hole or tear in a **garment** by sewing or attaching a **patch** to the **garment** to cover the hole or tear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “no one patches an old garment with a patch of unshrunk cloth”
2:21	vzsf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach. Use a natural method in your language for introducing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “but if someone actually did” or “but were a person to do that”
2:21	opbt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αἴρει τὸ πλήρωμα ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Jesus implies that **the patch** will tear away when the garment is washed, because **the patch** will shrink and rip the old garment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when the garment is washed, the patch shrinks and tears away from it”
2:21	m3sx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸ καινὸν τοῦ παλαιοῦ	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **new** and **old** as nouns to mean new and old cloth.

He wants them to think of the new things that he teaches and does as **new wine** and of the current ways of doing things as if they were **old wineskins**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that what Jesus does and teaches is like the **new wine**, and the normal way of doing things is like **old wineskins**. Alternate translation: “And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, but if not, the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine and the wineskins are destroyed, but new wine into new wineskins. What I say and do is like the new wine, and the normal way of doing things is like the old wineskins.”
2:22	fk15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς, καὶ ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach.

2:22	alse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος τοὺς ἀσκούς	1	Here Jesus implies that the new **wine**, when it ferments, will expand and burst the **wineskins**, which are old and so no longer able to stretch. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when the wine ferments, the wineskins cannot stretch and will burst”
2:22	n0iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ οἶνος ἀπόλλυται καὶ οἱ ἀσκοί	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “fields where grain is grown”
2:23	s8rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤρξαντο ὁδὸν ποιεῖν	1	Here, the phrase **to make a way** means that the disciples were traveling or walking along.

Alternate translation: “the tops of the grain plants” or “the edible parts of the grain plants”
2:24	qybi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	1	Here, the word **Behold** is meant to draw the attention of Jesus.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have not understood what you have read about what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and the ones with him—how he went into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the loaves of the presence, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and he also gave to the ones being with him.”

The current king, Saul was trying to kill David. So, David ran away to the priest who was serving God at the time, **Abiathar**. David and the men who ran away with him were very hungry, so they asked the Abiathar for food. Abiathar gave them the special bread that was laid out in God’s presence every day, and David and his men ate this bread. You can read this story in [1 Samuel 21:1–6](../1sa/21/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Have you never read what David did when he had need and was hungry after he and the ones with him escaped from King Saul, who wanted to kill him? He visited the high priest Abiathar, went into the house of God, and ate the loaves of the presence, which was not lawful to eat except for the priests. He also gave some of it to the ones being with him.”
2:25	wxd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	οὐδέποτε ἀνέγνωτε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees, the word **you** is plural.
2:25	cjzx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χρείαν ἔσχεν	1	Here Jesus is implying that David did not have everything that he needed, especially food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he had need of something to eat”

Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “Humans were made first, and then the Sabbath was set up because of them. It is not true that the Sabbath was set up first, and then humans were made because of it”
2:27	i374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ Σάββατον διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐγένετο	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:intro	x969				0	# Mark 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ early ministry (1:14–3:6)\n      * Healing a man on the Sabbath\n3. Jesus teaches and performs miracles (3:7–6:6)\n      * Jesus ministers to many people (3:7–12)\n      * Jesus appoints the twelve apostles (3:13–19)\n      * Jesus and his family, part one (3:20–21)\n      * Jesus and the scribes debate whether he has a demon (3:22–30)\n      * Jesus and his family, part two (3:31–35)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sabbath\n\nIn this chapter, just as in chapter 2, the Pharisees and Jesus are in conflict about the Sabbath. For more information about the Sabbath, see the General Notes to chapter 2.\n\n### Blaspheming against the Spirit\n\nIn [3:29](../03/29.md), Jesus speaks about blaspheming against the Spirit. He indicates that God will forgive all kinds of sins, but he will not forgive people who blaspheme against the Holy Spirit. Jesus says these things because the Pharisees said that he cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Jesus implies that he actually cast out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit. So, since the Pharisees have called the Holy Spirit Beelzebul, they have blasphemed or spoken against the Spirit. Christians debate what counts as this kind of blasphemy and why God will not forgive people for it. In your translation, you should not be more specific than Jesus is. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The parable about the strong man\n\nIn [3:27](../03/27.md), Jesus describes how thieves must subdue and tie up a strong man before they can steal things from his house. Jesus does not directly state how to apply this proverb. However, most Christians think that Satan is like the strong man, and the demons that Jesus casts out are like the strong man’s things. In this case, Jesus is like the thieves who tie up the strong man. Jesus is saying that, since he can cast out demons, it proves that he has subdued and conquered Satan, just as thieves can only steal things after they have subdued the strong man. You should not include this extra information in your translation, but if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Jesus’ mother and brothers\n\nIn [3:31–35](../03/31.md), Jesus’ mother and brothers arrive and want to talk with Jesus. In response, Jesus says that his disciples, those who do God’s will, are his mother and brother and sister. In other words, Jesus calls his disciples, who are those who do God’s will, his family members. He means that they are as close and important to him as his own family. This is an important metaphor that appears throughout the Bible, so preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples in Matthew, Mark, and Luke:\n\nIn [Matthew 10:2–4](../mat/10/02.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Mark 3:16–19](../mrk/03/16.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Luke 6:14](../luk/06/14.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThese lists do not always follow the same order or use the same names for the disciples. In that culture, people often had two or three names. For example, it is likely that that Thaddaeus was also named Judas or Jude. So, do not harmonize these lists by using the same sequence or names in each case. You should translate Mark’s list as Mark presents it.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 3, 4, 5, 13, 20, 31, 32, 33, and 34. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
3:1	bm6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

3:26	vif7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οὐ δύναται στῆναι, ἀλλὰ τέλος ἔχει	1	The clauses **he is not able to stand** and **he has an end** mean similar things. The first clause states the meaning negatively, and the second clause states the meaning positively. Jesus is using the two phrases together for emphasis.

Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses. Alternate translation: “he is not able to stand; yes, he has an end” or “he has his end”
3:26	df2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ δύναται στῆναι	1	Here, the phrase **is not able to stand** means that **Satan** will not have authority or power much longer.

3:27	i7tr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	μὴ πρῶτον & δήσῃ & διαρπάσει	1	Although the term **he** in both these places is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

4:intro	f5ua				0	# Mark 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Jesus teaches and performs miracles (3:7–6:6)\n      * The parable of the sower (4:1–9)\n      * Jesus explains the parable of the sower (4:10–20)\n      * Jesus teaches about secrets and knowledge (4:21–25)\n      * The parable of the seeds growing by themselves (4:26–29)\n      * The parable of the mustard seed (4:30–32)\n      * Summary statement (4:33–34)\n      * Jesus calms a storm (4:35–41)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [4:12](../04/12.md), which is a quotation from [Isaiah 6:9–10](../isa/06/09.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Farming\n\nJesus refers to several different farming practices in this chapter. In his culture, farmers often threw seeds over their fields, a process called sowing. After throwing the seeds, they would use a tool called a plow to cover the seeds with dirt. Then, they would water and take care of the seeds until they sprouted and grew. Finally, when the plants produced grain or other kinds of crops, they would cut down the plants, separate the edible parts from the inedible parts, and store the edible parts in a safe place. See the notes on the verses in which Jesus discusses farming practices for specific information and translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus uses several parables to teach the crowds and his disciples. Each parable is a short story that includes a specific lesson. Jesus uses parables to teach so that people who already know his message will learn more but people who do not know his message will not learn anything (see [4:11–12](../04/11.md)). Jesus explains one of the parables, but he does not explain any of the others. Possible explanations for each parable are included below, but only for help in translation. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of any parable more than Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n* The parable of the sower—In [4:3–9](../04/03.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who sows seed and about what happens to the seed. Jesus explains this parable in [4:14–20](../04/14.md). Even with this explanation, Christians debate who the sower is, what the seed represents, and what the different areas in the field represent. The sower could be Jesus himself, God, or anyone who preaches the gospel. The seed could be the gospel or the person who hears the gospel. The different areas in the field could be regions or areas where people hear the gospel, different kinds of people, or different ways of responding to the gospel. Most likely, the seed and the area in the field together describe what happens when people respond to the gospel in these four ways.\n\n* The parable of the seeds growing by themselves—In [4:26–29](../04/26.md), Jesus tells a story about a farmer who sows seed. The seed sprouts, grows, and produces a crop all by itself, and the farmer does not know how it happens. However, when the crop is ready, he harvests it. Most likely, Jesus is describing how God’s kingdom grows and expands, even without help from people. By the time God judges everyone, which is like a harvest, the kingdom will be very large and productive, even though people do not always know how that happens.\n\n* The parable of the mustard seed—In [4:30–32](../04/30.md), Jesus tells a story about how a very small seed (a mustard seed) grows into a very large plant. Most likely, he is describing how his group of followers was very small but will eventually become very large. Jesus mentions that birds nest in the shadow of this large plant. Some people think that Jesus is referring to passages like [Ezekiel 17:23](../ezk/17/23.md), which could suggest that the birds represent Gentiles who become part of God’s kingdom. Others think that the detail about the birds simply illustrates how large the plant is. If possible, your translation should allow for all of these interpretations.\n\n### Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in teaching that Jesus gives to his disciples and to the crowds. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 13, 35, 36, 37 and 38. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

4:7	fgz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καρπὸν οὐκ ἔδωκεν	1	Here the word **fruit** refers to the crop that the plants that grew from the seeds should have produced.

4:7	pj8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	καρπὸν	1	Here, the word **fruit** is singular in form, but it refers to many fruits as a group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this plainly. Alternate translation: “fruits”

Jesus does not mean that there were only three plants. Scholars estimate that these numbers of seeds are very good in Jesus’ time period, although not impossible or unheard of. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “some plants were producing 30 seeds, and some plants were producing 60 seeds, and other plants were producing 100 seeds” or “they were bearing many times more than the farmer planted: one group of plants 30 times more, and one group of plants 60 times more, and one group of plants 100 times more”

If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. Otherwise, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “They will certainly look … they will certainly hear” or “They will indeed look … they will indeed hear”
4:12	p9yr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψωσιν	1	The author of the quotation is speaking of the people of Israel as if they had been traveling somewhere and had taken the wrong way and needed to **turn back** onto the right way.

You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “one was bearing 30, and one was bearing 60, and one was bearing 100”
4:20	a9yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἓν τριάκοντα, καὶ ἓν ἑξήκοντα, καὶ ἓν ἑκατόν	1	Jesus is using the number **one** as a noun to mean one of the plants.

Alternate translation: “in a box” or “under a container that hides its light”
4:21	y7f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑπὸ τὴν κλίνην	1	A **bed** is a piece of furniture that people would lie on when they were eating or sleeping. Most likely, this kind of **bed** had short legs that raised it off the floor. If someone put a lamp under this kind of furniture, it would hide the light from the lamp.

4:30	v30a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	πῶς ὁμοιώσωμεν τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἢ ἐν τίνι αὐτὴν παραβολῇ θῶμεν	1	By **we**, Jesus means himself and his audience, so use the inclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Jesus uses this form because he wants his audience to be involved in thinking about how parables can help explain the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “What would be a good comparison for us to use for the kingdom of God, or what parable could we use for it”
4:30	lj2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, the word **or** introduces another similar question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a related question, or you could leave **or** untranslated. Alternate translation: “and” or “or again,”
4:30	jduf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τίνι αὐτὴν παραβολῇ θῶμεν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if **the kingdom of God** were an object that he could **put** in a **parable**, which he speaks about as if it were a container. He means that he can explain **the kingdom of God** by using a **parable**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with what parable will we describe it” or “what parable can we use to explain it”
4:31	qvr0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ὡς κόκκῳ σινάπεως	1	To teach his audience, Jesus offers a story or illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Listen to this story: It is like a mustard seed”
4:31	l8gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κόκκῳ σινάπεως	1	A **mustard seed** is a very small seed that grows into a large plant.

This was a natural way in his language to describe the seed and the action. If repeating this clause would be redundant in your language, you could rearrange the clauses and only include the repeated clause once. Alternate translation: “which, being the smallest of all the seeds on the earth, when it has been sown, grows”
4:31	w4l5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σπαρῇ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “a person has sown it” or “they have sown it”
4:31	jf5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	μικρότερον & πάντων τῶν σπερμάτων	1	Jesus says **smallest of all the seeds** here as a generalization for emphasis.

Use a natural form in your language for expressing the conclusion of a speech. Alternate translation: “Before he stopped teaching them, he used many such parables to speak the word to them, just as they were able to hear; but he did not speak to them without a parable, but by himself he explained everything to his own disciples”
4:33	nfck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Mark is using the term **word** to mean the gospel, which Jesus preached using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the gospel”
4:33	vofc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the people who were there with him, not just the disciples.

4:33	u82i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθὼς ἠδύναντο ἀκούειν	1	Here Mark could mean that: (1) Jesus told his audience as much as he knew that they could **hear**. Alternate translation: “teaching them all the things that they were able to hear” (2) Jesus spoke to his audience in a way that he knew they could **hear**. Alternate translation: “teaching them in a way that they could hear”
4:33	kol8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀκούειν	1	Here Mark uses the word **hear** to refer to both hearing and understanding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to realize what he meant”
4:34	oo4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	χωρὶς & παραβολῆς οὐκ ἐλάλει αὐτοῖς	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative word **not** and the negative preposition **without**.

4:38	cets		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς ἦν	1	Mark uses the word **himself** to emphasize how significant it was that Jesus was **in the stern, sleeping**. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: “as for Jesus, he was”

4:38	lwed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ προσκεφάλαιον	1	A **cushion** is a soft object that person would lie or rest on. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of object, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the sleeping pad” or “a soft surface”
4:38	b4xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ μέλει σοι ὅτι ἀπολλύμεθα?	1	The disciples are using the question form to show Jesus that they are afraid and to convince him to do something to help them. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “it should be a concern to you that we are perishing.” or “it is clearly not a concern to you that we are perishing!”
4:38	viz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐ μέλει σοι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **concern**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “does it not concern you”
4:38	fu0n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σοι	1	Because the disciples are speaking to Jesus, the word **you** here is singular.

4:41	txh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐφοβήθησαν φόβον μέγαν	1	Here, the phrase **feared a great fear** means that they were extremely afraid.

5:intro	lh25				0	# Mark 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Jesus teaches and performs miracles (3:7–6:6)\n      * Casting demons out of a man (5:1–20)\n      * Healing a woman and resurrecting a girl (5:21–43)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrecting the dead\n\nIn [5:21–24](../05/21.md) and [5:35–43](../05/35.md), Mark narrates how Jesus raised a girl from the dead. While Jesus describes her as only “sleeping,” he uses this word to indicate that the girl will “wake up” from being dead. The story clearly indicates that the girl had died and that Jesus raises her from the dead by touching her.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### How to refer to the demons and the demon-possessed man\n\nIn [5:1–20](../05/01.md), Jesus encounters a man whom demons had possessed. As Jesus interacts with this man, it becomes clear that there are three different entities who are involved. First, there is the man himself, but what he says and does is only what the demons want him to do. Second, there is a specific demon who seems to act as the spokesperson or leader for multiple demons. Third, there are the other demons, of whom there are so many that the man is called “Legion.” As Mark narrates the story, he sometimes refers to the man, sometimes to the individual demon, and sometimes to all the demons. Further, it is not always clear which of these three entities speaks and is spoken to by Jesus. Consider how you might refer to a demon-possessed person in this situation. If possible, preserve Mark’s switches between singular and plural, since learning that there are many demons is an important part of the story. Further, Mark implies that the man and the demons are so closely connected that referring to what the man did is the same as referring to what the demons did, and vice versa.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues between Jesus and other individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 7, 9, 15, 19, 22, 23, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40 and 41. If it would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
5:1	fix1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “After that,”
5:1	gt8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθον	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “they came”
5:1	vsc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	The name **Gerasenes** refers to the people who lived in and near the town of Gerasa.
5:1	dzc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **Gerasenes**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts read “Gadarenes,” and other ancient manuscripts read “Gergesenes.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
5:2	pf16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθόντος	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come out”
5:2	zwtq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ὑπήντησεν αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν μνημείων ἄνθρωπος ἐν πνεύματι ἀκαθάρτῳ	1	Here Mark introduces **a man with an unclean spirit** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a certain man came from the tombs to meet him. This man had an unclean spirit”
5:3	pinm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὃς τὴν κατοίκησιν εἶχεν ἐν τοῖς μνήμασιν	1	Here Mark provides background information that will help readers understand what happens next. This background information continues in [5:4](../05/04.md) and [5:5](../05/05.md). Use a natural form in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “and here is what that man was like. He had his dwelling in the tombs”
5:3-4	nll4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	καὶ οὐδὲ ἁλύσει οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο αὐτὸν δῆσαι & διὰ τὸ αὐτὸν πολλάκις πέδαις καὶ ἁλύσεσι δεδέσθαι, καὶ διεσπάσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὰς ἁλύσεις καὶ τὰς πέδας συντετρῖφθαι, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἴσχυεν αὐτὸν δαμάσαι	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:4](../05/04.md) into a verse bridge in order to include the basis for the claim that **no one was able to bind him anymore** before the claim. Alternate translation: “and he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him and the shackles had been shattered. So, no one was strong enough to subdue him or to bind him anymore, not even with a chain”
5:3	pjsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο αὐτὸν δῆσαι	1	Here Mark implies that people tried to **bind** this man to keep him from hurting people and breaking things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “no one was able to bind him anymore to keep him from hurting others” or “no one was able to use bonds to restrain him anymore”
5:3	dryi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκέτι οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο	1	The words translated **no one** and **anymore** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “people were able … no longer”\n
5:3	nsol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁλύσει	1	A **chain** is a long, flexible fastener that is made from multiple rings of metal connected together. Chains are usually used to secure objects or bind things together. If your readers would not be familiar with chains, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “with metal links connected together”
5:4	da4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτὸν πολλάκις & δεδέσθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was the people who lived nearby. Alternate translation: “the people who lived there had often bound him”
5:4	fk7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πέδαις & τὰς πέδας	1	The word **shackles** refers to pieces of metal that are fastened around the ankles of prisoners. These pieces of metal are connected together by ropes or chains, which prevent the prisoners from moving quickly or far. If your readers would not be familiar with shackles, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “with leg irons … the leg irons” or “with strong restraints … the restraints”
5:4	dk1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁλύσεσι & τὰς ἁλύσεις	1	See how you translated the word **chains** in [5:3](../05/03.md). Alternate translation: “metal links connected together … the metal links”
5:4	rjo3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	2	Here, the word **and** introduces what the demon-possessed man did in contrast to what the people who tied him up wanted him to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “but”
5:4	nep6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διεσπάσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ τὰς ἁλύσεις καὶ τὰς πέδας συντετρῖφθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he had torn apart the chains and had shattered the shackles”
5:5	ohvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διὰ παντὸς νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	Here, the phrase **throughout every night and day** indicates that this man was **crying out and cutting himself with stones** during both the day and the night. This means that he was doing those things very often every day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all the time” or “during every day and every night”
5:6	y6c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἰδὼν τὸν Ἰησοῦν ἀπὸ μακρόθεν	1	Here Mark stops giving background information and returns to the events in the story that he is telling. He implies that the man saw Jesus when he arrived in the boat from the other side of the Sea of Galilee (see [5:1–2](../05/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Now, having seen Jesus from a distance when he got out of the boat”
5:6	w9zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ	1	In the Jesus’ culture, bowing down to a person was a way to honor a greater person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a similar action from your culture, or you could explain what bowing down means. Alternate translation: “prostrated himself before him” or “bowed down to him in respect”
5:7-8	ux6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	καὶ κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ λέγει, τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί Ἰησοῦ, Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου? ὁρκίζω σε τὸν Θεόν, μή με βασανίσῃς & ἔλεγεν γὰρ αὐτῷ, ἔξελθε, τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἀκάθαρτον ἐκ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [5:7](../05/07.md) and [5:8](../05/08.md) into a verse bridge, as the UST does, in order to include the reason why the man cried out as he did before stating that the man cried out. Alternate translation: “And Jesus was saying to him, ‘Come out from the man, unclean spirit.’ So, crying out with a loud voice, he says, ‘What to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I make you swear by God, do not torment me.’”
5:7	x6qj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κράξας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1	Here, the phrase **crying out with a loud voice** means that the demon raised the volume of its voice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having yelled loudly”
5:7	ppu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί Ἰησοῦ, Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου?	1	The man, controlled by the demon, is using the question form to insist on something urgently. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is nothing to me and to you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God!”
5:7	fatr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί	1	Here, the question **What to me and to you** asks whether **you** and **me** have anything in common or have any reason to be together. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “What do you and I have in common” or “What reason do you have to get involved with me”
5:7	kd19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου	1	**Son of the Most High God** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship with God the Father.
5:7	urq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	ὁρκίζω σε τὸν Θεόν	1	Here the man, controlled by the demon, puts Jesus under oath, or makes him **swear by God** that he will not **torment** him. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. Alternate translation: “I make you swear before God” or “I require that you solemnly promise God”
5:8	ahtn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the man, controlled by the demon, acted as he did.

6:intro	kl7n				0	# Mark 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Jesus teaches and performs miracles (3:7–6:6)\n      * Jesus teaches in his hometown (6:1–6)\n4. Jesus expands his ministry and encounters opposition (6:7–8:21)\n      * Jesus sends out the Twelve (6:7–13)\n      * Herod hears about Jesus (6:14–16)\n      * Flashback: Herod executes John the Baptist (6:17–29)\n      * Jesus feeds 5,000 men (6:30–44)\n      * Jesus walks on water (6:45–52)\n      * Jesus heals people in the region of Gennesaret (6:53–56)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jesus’ instructions on how to travel\n\nJesus instructs the disciples not to bring money, food, or extra clothing with them when they travel and preach the good news. Instead, he wants the disciples to rely on the hospitality of people they visit. Make sure that your translation indicates that the disciples should not pack money, food, or extra clothing because they will be staying with people who welcome and provide for them.\n\n### Herod and Herodias\n\nThe man named “King Herod” ([6:14](../06/14.md)) ruled over the area to the northwest of the Sea of Galilee, which is where Jesus spent much of his ministry. Herodias was married to Herod’s brother Philip, and the two of them had a daughter. However, Herodias divorced Philip and married Herod, who had also divorced his previous wife. Since the Jewish law condemned anyone who married his brother’s wife while his brother was still alive (see [Leviticus 20:21](../lev/20/21.md)), John the Baptist rebuked Herod for doing this. It was in response to this rebuke that Herod had John the Baptist put in prison and eventually executed. Make sure that your translation accurately refers to the relationships between Herod, Herodias, and Herodias’ daughter.\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\nIn [6:30–44](../06/30.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus provides 5,000 men with food. They were in a place where no people lived, and all the food that Jesus and his disciples had were five loaves of bread and two fish. Despite that, Jesus used the five loaves of bread and the two fish to feed everyone who was there. Mark does not tell us exactly how Jesus did this, but he does say that there were more leftovers than what they started with. Your translation should not explain how Jesus multiplied the food, but it should be clear that he did a miracle.\n\n### The miracle of walking on water\n\nIn [6:45–52](../06/45.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus walks on top of the Sea of Galilee, even though there was a storm. When Jesus climbs into the boat that the disciples were in, the storm miraculously stops. Your translation should not explain exactly how Jesus walked on the water, but it should be clear that Jesus walking on the water and the storm stopping were both miracles.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The flashback to John’s death\n\nIn this chapter, Mark includes a story that happened before the stories that appear before and after it in his narrative. Previously, Mark narrates how Jesus sent out the Twelve ([6:7–13](../06/07.md)). Then, he describes how people, and especially Herod Antipas, respond to Jesus (see [6:14–16](../06/14.md)). Then, to explain how Herod responded to Jesus, Mark includes a story that happened earlier. This type of storytelling is called a flashback. Here, the flashback tells about how John the Baptist died (see [6:17–29](../06/17.md)). In [6:30](../06/30.md), Mark returns to the main narrative and tells what happened after the events recorded in [6:7–13](../06/07.md). Make sure that you use a form that shows your readers that [6:17–29](../06/17.md) is a flashback that describes something that happened previously, and [6:30](../06/30.md) continues with the main narrative. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to his disciples. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 7, 30, 31, 37, 38, 45, 48, and 50. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation.

He is the son of Mary a brother of James and Joseph and Judas and Simon! His sisters are right here with us!”
6:3	no4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ τέκτων	1	The word **carpenter** refers to someone who builds things with wood. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of worker, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the man who builds with wood” or “the construction worker”
6:3	i9qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	ἀδελφὸς	1	Jesus was the older **brother** of these men. They were sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, Jesus was actually their half-brother. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “older brother,” you could use it here.
6:3	tlub		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσῆτος & Ἰούδα & Σίμωνος	1	The words **Joses**, **Judas**, and **Simon** are the names of men.
6:3	cxgx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	αἱ ἀδελφαὶ αὐτοῦ	1	These were Jesus' younger **sisters**. They were daughteres of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-sisters. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger sister,” you could use it here.
6:3	d2g7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐσκανδαλίζοντο ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here Mark speaks as if Jesus were a lump or rock that the people in Jesus’ hometown were stumbling on. He means that these people were offended by him and rejected him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they were offended by him” or “they did not listen to him”
6:3	m412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐσκανδαλίζοντο ἐν αὐτῷ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they were stumbling on him”
6:4	b42w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐκ ἔστιν προφήτης ἄτιμος, εἰ μὴ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “A prophet is only without honor”
6:4	l436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔστιν & ἄτιμος	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative preposition **without**. Alternate translation: “has honor” or “is always honored”\n
6:4	yg9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἄτιμος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **honor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “dishonored” or “treated dishonorably”

The list starts with the broadest category (**hometown**) and ends with the most specific category (**his house**). If you have three terms that refer to different groups of people who know a person, you could use them here. Alternatively, if it would be clearer for your readers, you could use one or two terms. Alternate translation: “except among his relatives” or “in his hometown and among his family”
6:4	mgbp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus uses the phrase **in his house** to refer to his closest relatives, like his father, mother, or siblings.

Alternate translation: “the only miracles he was able to do there were healing some sick people, having laid his hands on them”
6:5	ystk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἐδύνατο ἐκεῖ ποιῆσαι οὐδεμίαν δύναμιν	1	The words translated **not** and **any** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “he was able to do not even one miracle there”
6:6-7	swqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ ἐθαύμασεν διὰ τὴν ἀπιστίαν αὐτῶν. καὶ περιῆγεν τὰς κώμας, κύκλῳ διδάσκων & καὶ προσκαλεῖται τοὺς δώδεκα, καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοὺς ἀποστέλλειν δύο δύο, καὶ ἐδίδου αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν τῶν πνευμάτων τῶν ἀκαθάρτων	1	Here, the clause **he was going around the villages teaching** could be: (1) the end of the story about Jesus visiting his hometown.

6:7	fd56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤρξατο αὐτοὺς ἀποστέλλειν	1	Here, the phrase **began to send them out** indicates that Jesus prepared them for when he would **send them out**. The **Twelve** do not actually leave on their mission until [5:12](../05/12.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “prepared to send them out” or “began to get them ready to send them out”
6:7	d6sx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δύο δύο	1	Here, the phrase **two by two** means that Jesus sent out **the Twelve** in six groups with **two** disciples in each group.

Alternate translation: “and he commanded them that they should take nothing for the road—no bread, no bag, no money in the belt—and, ‘You may not wear two tunics.’ However, he allowed them to take a staff and to put on sandals.”

Alternate translation: “them, ‘Take nothing for the road except only a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in the belt—but having put on sandals, and you may not wear two tunics.’”
6:8	k5hl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	μηδὲν αἴρωσιν εἰς ὁδὸν, εἰ μὴ ῥάβδον μόνον	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Mark was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause.

6:8	rm8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εἰς τὴν ζώνην	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would often wrap their money up in long strips of cloth and then tie them around their waists as belts. This was a way to keep the money safe while the people were traveling. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “in their money bag” or “to have with you as you travel”
6:8	y56y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὴν ζώνην	1	The word **belt** represents belts in general, not one particular belt. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “their belts”
6:9	p4hd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	καὶ μὴ ἐνδύσησθε δύο χιτῶνας	1	If you preserved the indirect quotation in the previous clauses, it may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here also. Alternate translation: “and not wearing two tunics”
6:9	g5gq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δύο χιτῶνας	1	Here Jesus implies that they should bring only one tunic instead of **two**. In other words, they should not bring an extra one in case they needed it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit.

Alternate translation: “wash the dirt of that place off your hands” or “shake off the dust that is under your feet to sever your relationship with that place and”

6:11	q73q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μαρτύριον	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to testify”
6:11	pkdc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	Most ancient manuscripts end the verse with the words **for a testimony against them**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts include another sentence after these words: “Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.” This sentence was probably added from [Matthew 10:15](../mat/10/15.md). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, it is recommended that you use the reading of the ULT.

6:15	s5cq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	προφήτης	1	These people are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “He is a prophet”
6:15	xnin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἷς τῶν προφητῶν	1	Here these people are referring to the famous **prophets** who lived many years earlier.

Alternate translation: “For Herod had married Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip. Then, John was saying to Herod, ‘It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your brother.’ So, because of Herodias, Herod himself, having sent, seized John and bound him in prison.”
6:17	ojtd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces background information that tells about how John died.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “whom he married after she divorced his brother Philip” or “who had been the wife of his brother Philip, because he married her after she divorced Philip”
6:17	sf6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Φιλίππου, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	The word **Philip** is the name of a man. This is not the same Philip who was an evangelist in the book of Acts or the Philip who was one of Jesus’ twelve disciples.
6:17	szok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	It is not certain whether **Philip** was older or younger than Herod, but it is slightly more likely that he was older. So, if you have to use a form that refers to an older or younger brother, you could state that **Philip** was older. Alternate translation: “his older brother”
6:18	a46w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Herod put John in prison.

Alternate translation: “But Herodias was angry with him and was wanting to kill him. But Herod was fearing John, knowing him {to be} a righteous and holy man, and he was keeping him safe, and having heard him, he was much perplexed, yet he was listening to him gladly.

6:20	lmbc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Herodias was not able to kill John.

6:21	eouo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῖς πρώτοις	1	Mark is using the adjective **first** as a noun to mean first people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

6:22	mjaj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ εἰσελθούσης τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἡρῳδιάδος, καὶ ὀρχησαμένης καὶ ἀρεσάσης τῷ Ἡρῴδῃ καὶ τοῖς συνανακειμένοις & ὁ βασιλεὺς	1	Here Mark introduces Herod’s **daughter** as a new character in the story. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a new character. Alternate translation: “a young woman entered. She was his daughter, of Herodias.

6:22	qd9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῆς θυγατρὸς αὐτοῦ Ἡρῳδιάδος	1	Some ancient manuscripts read **his daughter, of Herodias**. The ULT follows that reading.

Alternate translation: “the daughter of Herodias, Herod’s  stepdaughter” (2) the young woman, named Herodias, was the **daughter** of Herod. She had the same name as the woman Herod had married. Alternate translation: “Herod’s daughter Herodias”
6:22	tni8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς συνανακειμένοις	1	In Herod’s culture, people would usually recline, or lay on one side, at a table when they were eating.

6:23	vwbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἕως ἡμίσους τῆς βασιλείας μου	1	Herod says **up to half of my kingdom** here as an overstatement for emphasis. He means that he will definitely give the young woman what she asks for. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Herod is making an overstatement, or you could express the idea more generally. Alternate translation: “even if it were up to half of my kingdom” or “no matter how valuable” or “even if it is very difficult to give”
6:24	fn58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθοῦσα	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come out”

6:26	c1gn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τοὺς ὅρκους καὶ τοὺς συνανακειμένους	1	Here Mark indicates two reasons why Herod kept his word. First, he had made **oaths** that he did not want to break. Second, he had promised in front of **the ones reclining to eat with him**, and it would be embarrassing and shameful to break his promise when everyone had heard it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make these reasons more explicit. Alternate translation: “because he had used oaths and because the ones reclining to eat with him had heard what he promised”
6:26	gtal		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς συνανακειμένους	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would usually recline, or lay on one side, at a table when they were eating. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the position in which people eat in your culture, or you could just refer to eating.

6:26	mu7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἠθέλησεν ἀθετῆσαι αὐτήν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **refuse**.

6:30	u01i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

Alternate translation: “because, like sheep without a shepherd, they did not know what to do or where to go”
6:35	sei9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤδη ὥρας πολλῆς γενομένης & ἤδη ὥρα πολλή	1	When Mark says that an **hour** is **much**, he means that it is a time later in the day, probably soon before sunset.

7:intro	vq1j				0	# Mark 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Jesus expands his ministry and encounters opposition (6:7–8:21)\n      * Argument with the Pharisees and scribes about washing hands (7:1–13)\n      * Jesus teaches about what defiles people (7:14–23)\n      * Jesus meets a Canaanite woman (7:24–30)\n      * Jesus heals a man who is deaf and can barely speak (7:31–37)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [7:6–7](../07/06.md), which is a quote from [Isaiah 29:13](../isa/29/13.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “tradition of the elders”\n\nThe “tradition of the elders” included interpretations of Moses’ law that Jewish religious leaders had developed and passed down to their disciples, and they to their disciples. These interpretations explained what specific laws meant and how to obey them. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for specific interpretations of the law that he disagreed with. In this chapter, Jesus and the Pharisees argue about washing hands, honoring parents, and giving gifts to God. When you translate the phrase “tradition of the elders,” use a form that refers to teachings that teachers pass down to their students. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tradition]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/elder]])\n\n### Washing hands before eating\n\nIn [7:5](../07/05.md), the scribes and Pharisees rebuke Jesus for failing to have his disciples wash their hands before eating. One of the traditions that the Pharisees followed was a requirement that people wash their hands before eating. They did this to make their hands ceremonially clean, not primarily to clean off dirt. Make sure that your translation indicates that Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about ceremonial or ritual washing, not washing off dirt.\n\n### The gift for God\n\nIn [7:10–13](../07/10.md), Jesus rebukes the Pharisees for allowing people to promise to give something to God instead of using it to help their parents. Jesus is not saying that giving things to God is wrong. Instead, he is saying that honoring one’s parents is one of the most important commandments that God gave, and no tradition should prevent people from honoring their parents. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Things that go in and out of people\n\nIn [7:14–23](../07/14.md), Jesus speaks about things that are outside people and that go into them, and he speaks about things that are inside people and come out of them. When he speaks about things that are outside people and go into them, he is referring more specifically to food and drink. He teaches that these things do not make people unclean. When he speaks about things that are inside people and go out of them, he is referring more specifically to people’s thoughts and desires that lead to actions. He teaches that these things do make people unclean. Since Jesus explains what he means when he refers to things going in and out of people, if possible preserve the movement and location language.\n\n### Feeding little dogs\n\nIn [7:27](../07/27.md), Jesus tells the Canaanite woman that it is not right to give food that is meant for children to little dogs. In [7:28](../07/28.md), the woman responds that little dogs eat the little bits of food that fall down from what the children are eating. The children represent Jews, and the little dogs represent non-Jews. The food represents things that Jesus does for people. What Jesus means is that he is supposed to do things for Jews first, before he does things for non-Jews. What the woman means is that what she is asking Jesus to do is unimportant enough that he can do it without taking away from what he does for Jews. If possible, do not directly express the meaning of what Jesus and the woman say about little dogs, but make sure that your translation can naturally imply this meaning.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 5, 18, 28, 32, and 34. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### Verse 16\n\nSome of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [7:16](../07/16.md). Some early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words: “If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.” Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

See the ULT. (2) end the sentence that began in verse 1. In this case, the explanatory information in verses 3–4 stands by itself, and a new sentence begins in verse 5. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to delete the dash at the end of verse 4 and start a new sentence at the beginning of verse 5. Alternate translation: “And the Pharisees and some of the scribes are being gathered to him, having come from Jerusalem and having seen some of his disciples, that they eat bread with defiled hands, that is, unwashed.” (3) be a sentence fragment that stands by itself, with the implication being that the Pharisees disapproved of what they saw. In this case, the explanatory information in verses 3–4 stands by itself, and a new sentence begins in verse 5. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to delete the dash at the end of verse 4 and start a new sentence at the beginning of verse 5. Alternate translation: “And the Pharisees and some of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem, are being gathered to him. And having seen some of his disciples, that they eat loaves with defiled hands, that is, unwashed, they disapproved of that.”
7:1	b9ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story.

Alternate translation: “having come from Jerusalem, the Pharisees and some of the scribes are being gathered to him” (2) only **the scribes** came **from Jerusalem**. Alternate translation: “the Pharisees and some of the scribes who came from Jerusalem are being gathered to him”

7:1	ye06		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνάγονται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “are gathering” or “are coming together”
7:2	ea9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἰδόντες τινὰς τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ ὅτι & ἐσθίουσιν	1	Here, the phrase **that they eat** refers directly back to the phrase **some of his disciples**. Mark expresses the idea in this way to introduce whom the Pharisees and scribes saw and then explain what they saw them doing.

Alternate translation: “having seen some of his disciples eating”
7:2	a7xf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐσθίουσιν τοὺς ἄρτους	1	The Pharisees and scribes are using **loaves** to represent any food.

Alternate translation: “only eat if they have washed their hands with a fist”
7:3	hz8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πυγμῇ	1	Here, the phrase **with a fist** refers to a specific way of washing one’s hands. It could refer to the position of the hands during washing, how much of the hands were washed, or how much water was used.

In that case, you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother”

In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative.

8:intro	ry56				0	# Mark 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Jesus expands his ministry and encounters opposition (6:7–8:21)\n      * Jesus feeds 4,000 people (8:1–10)\n      * The Pharisees test Jesus (8:11–13)\n      * The yeast of the Pharisees and Herod (8:14–21)\n5. Jesus instructs his disciples and journeys toward Jerusalem (8:22–10:52)\n      * Jesus heals a blind man (8:22–26)\n      * Who Jesus really is (8:27–30)\n      * What Jesus and his disciples must do (8:31–9:1)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\nIn [8:1–10](../08/01.md), Mark tells a story in which Jesus provides 4,000 people with food. All these people were in a place where no people lived, and all the food that Jesus and his disciples had were seven loaves of bread and a few fish. Despite that, Jesus used the seven loaves of bread and the few fish to feed everyone who was there. Mark does not tell us exactly how Jesus did this, but he does say that there were more leftovers than what they started with. Your translation should not explain how Jesus multiplied the food, but it should be clear that he did a miracle. Mark told a similar story about how Jesus fed 5,000 men in [6:30–44](../06/30.md), so see how you expressed the ideas there.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod\n\nIn [8:14–21](../08/14.md), Jesus tells his disciples to watch out for the “yeast” of the Pharisees and the “yeast” of Herod. The disciples misunderstand him and think that he is saying something about bread, which they forgot to bring with them. In response, Jesus reminds them that he is not talking about lack of bread, since he has proved twice that he can multiply food. He implies that “yeast” refers to what the Pharisees and Herod teach and do. Since the disciples misunderstanding “yeast” is an important part of this passage, and since Jesus never directly explains what “yeast” means, if possible you should avoid making that idea more explicit. If you do explain what “yeast” means, if possible only do so after Jesus has made it clear that he is not speaking about literal yeast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to his disciples. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 6, 12, 17, 19, 20, 22, 29, and 33. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n
8:1	rmd8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Here, the phrase **In those days** introduces the next major event in the story.

8:1	sn4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Here, Mark uses the term **days** to refer to a particular period of time.

9:intro	n92j				0	# Mark 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Jesus instructs his disciples and journeys toward Jerusalem (8:22–10:52)\n      * What Jesus and his disciples must do (8:31–9:1)\n      * Jesus is transfigured (9:2–8)\n      * Jesus and the disciples discuss Elijah (9:9–13)\n      * Jesus heals a demon-possessed boy (9:14–29)\n      * Jesus predicts his suffering and death (9:30–32)\n      * Jesus teaches about how his disciples should behave (9:33–50)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “transfigured”\n\nIn [9:1–8](../09/01.md), Mark describes how Jesus was “transfigured.” This word indicates that Jesus looked very different to the disciples. Mark does not tell us all the ways in which Jesus looked different, but he does say that Jesus’ clothes became extremely white. What this means is that the disciples were able to see some of the glory and majesty that Jesus has as God’s Son. Make sure that your translation shows that Jesus looked great and glorious.\n\n### Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus was transfigured, the disciples saw Moses and Elijah talking with him. Later, they ask Jesus about Elijah. They refer specifically to what the scribes say about a prophecy in [Malachi 4:5–6](../mal/04/05.md), which indicates that God will send “Elijah” to prepare the way before God comes to judge his enemies and reward his people. Malachi is referring to a prophet who lived even earlier. This prophet, named Elijah, performed many miracles and spoke messages from God (see [1 Kings 17–19](../1ki/17/01.md) and [2 Kings 2:1–17](../2ki/02/01.md)). The disciples ask about whether this Elijah is supposed to come before the Messiah does. Jesus says that this is true, and he talks about this “Elijah” in a way that shows the disciples that John the Baptist was “Elijah.” He means that John fulfills the prophecy in Malachi that someone like the prophet Elijah will prepare the way before God comes to judge and reward people. If your readers would not know the prophecy in Malachi or the stories about the prophet Elijah, you may need to include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nIn [9:43–48](../09/43.md), Jesus commands his disciples to cut off or throw out body parts that cause them to sin. He uses this extreme example of resisting sin in order to show his disciples how serious sin really is. He does not mean that believers should always cut off body parts when they sin. Jesus intends his commands to be shocking, however, so you should preserve the extreme language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Jesus’ commands are extreme language.\n\n### Stumbling\n\nIn [9:42–47](../09/42.md), Jesus discusses people and things that cause “stumbling”. He uses this term to refer to sinning. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in conversations, and many of the conversations are with one person. Because of this, the majority of the forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. So, you should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 5, 19, and 35. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### The allusion to Isaiah 66:24 in verse 48\n\nIn verse 48, Jesus uses words that are very similar to words in [Isaiah 66:24](../isa/66/24.md). However, Jesus does not introduce his words as a quotation. So, Jesus is not directly quoting from Isaiah, but he intended his audience to think of [Isaiah 66:24](../isa/66/24.md) when they heard what he said. If your readers would not think of [Isaiah 66:24](../isa/66/24.md), you could refer to it in a footnote.\n\n### Verses 44 and 46\n\nSome of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [9:44](../09/44.md) and [9:46](../09/46.md). Some early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words in each verse: “where their worm does not end, and the fire is not quenched.” Since these words also appear in all of the manuscripts in [9:48](../09/48.md), it is likely that people who copied the manuscripts accidentally or intentionally added these words earlier as verses 44 and 46. Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
9:1	q4b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔλεγεν αὐτοῖς	1	Here, the pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state who **he** refers to in your translation. Alternate translation: “Jesus was saying to them”
9:1	lsa2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1	Because Jesus is speaking to everyone who was there, the word **you** here is plural.
9:1	kg4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἵτινες οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου	1	The phrase **taste death** is an idiom which means “to experience death.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning using plain language. Alternate translation: “who will certainly not experience death”
9:1	qloy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἵτινες οὐ μὴ γεύσωνται θανάτου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **death** by using the verb form. Alternate translation: “who will certainly not die”
9:1	f95z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
9:1	yjf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐληλυθυῖαν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if **the kingdom of God** were a person who could **come**. He means that God will establish or begin his **kingdom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God having been inaugurated” or “the kingdom of God having begun”
9:1	ymou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δυνάμει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **power**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in a powerful way”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event. Alternate translation: “Then, after six days had passed” or “Six days after those things happened”
9:2	uf5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κατ’ ἰδίαν μόνους	1	The terms **by themselves** and **alone** mean similar things. Mark is using the two terms together for emphasis.

9:2	krt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μετεμορφώθη	1	The word **transfigured** means to be changed in appearance or form.

Alternate translation: “his appearance was changed” or “he began to look different”
9:2	b3bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετεμορφώθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Mark could be implying that: (1) Jesus did the action. Alternate translation: “he transfigured himself” (2) God did the action. Alternate translation: “God transfigured him”
9:2	jjlt			ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν	1	Alternate translation: “in front of them” or “as they watched”
9:3	gp48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οἷα γναφεὺς ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς οὐ δύναται οὕτως λευκᾶναι	1	The word **launderer** refers to a person who worked with cloth to clean and bleach cloth and clothing. If your readers would not be familiar with the meaning of the word **launderer**, you could state the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “whiter than any person who bleached cloth could make them” or “such as no person on earth who washed cloth could make them”
9:4	f2d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ὤφθη αὐτοῖς Ἠλείας σὺν Μωϋσεῖ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they saw Elijah with Moses”
9:4	r3uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	Here, the word **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to them more directly. Alternate translation: “by Peter, James, and John”

9:5	w6vs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς	1	Here, the word **answering** indicates that Peter was responding to what he saw. He was not answering a question.

9:5	iqc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	By **us**, Peter could mean: (1) everyone who was there, including himself, the other two disciples, Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. Alternate translation: “for us all” (2) just himself and the other two disciples. Alternate translation: “for us disciples”
9:5	i0iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ποιήσωμεν	1	By **us**, Peter here means himself and the other two disciples, not Jesus, Elijah, and Moses. So, use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.\n
9:5	k3y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σκηνάς	1	The term **tents** means simple, temporary places in which to sit or sleep. Peter probably had in mind that they would build them from the materials available on the mountain such as tree branches. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to this kind of temporary shelter. Alternate translation: “booths”
9:6	r3bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	οὐ γὰρ ᾔδει τί ἀποκριθῇ; ἔκφοβοι γὰρ ἐγένοντο	1	This entire verse is a parenthetical statement which gives background information about Peter, James, and John. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Now as a matter of fact, he did not know what he should answer, for they were terrified”
9:6	w4qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐ & ᾔδει τί ἀποκριθῇ; ἔκφοβοι γὰρ ἐγένοντο	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. Alternate translation: “because they were terrified, he did not know what he should answer”
9:6	f8hn			ἔκφοβοι & ἐγένοντο	1	Alternate translation: “they were very frightened” or “they were very afraid”
9:7	e3id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπισκιάζουσα	1	Here Mark could be implying that: (1) the cloud enveloped or surrounded them. Alternate translation: “enveloping” or “surrounding” (2) the cloud cast a shadow on them. Alternate translation: “casting a shadow on”

9:7	x4mv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐγένετο φωνὴ	1	Mark is using **voice** to represent the person who is speaking, which is God the Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a person was speaking” or “God the Father spoke”
9:7	ybu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱός μου, ὁ ἀγαπητός	1	The word **Son** is an important title for Jesus, the **Son** of God.
9:7	ql9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ Υἱός μου, ὁ ἀγαπητός	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “my Son, whom I love”
9:7	o80a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀκούετε	1	Because the voice is speaking to the three disciples, the command **Listen** is plural.
9:8	c4dz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐξάπινα περιβλεψάμενοι, οὐκέτι οὐδένα εἶδον	1	Here, the word **suddenly** could go with: (1) **saw**.

This prophecy states that God will send **Elijah** before the day of the Lord arrives, and he will prepare people. Elijah was a prophet who did many powerful things a long time before Malachi wrote down this prophecy. The **scribes** teach that this means that **Elijah** must come before the Messiah does. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “it is necessary for Elijah, who was a prophet long ago, to come” or “the Scriptures indicate that it is necessary for Elijah the prophet to come”

9:35	um58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	πρῶτος	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers such as **first**, you can express the meaning behind the word **first** in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “number one”

He means that these people, by receiving the **little children**, show that they would receive Jesus too.

Alternate translation: “whoever receives one of these little children in my name, it is as if he or she received me” or “whoever receives one of these little children in my name proves that he or she would receive me”
9:37	h242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἓν τῶν τοιούτων παιδίων	1	Here Jesus is referring to **little children** like the little child whom he set in their midst (see [9:36](../09/36.md)).

The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “in your name who does not follow us, and we were preventing him.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses.

9:38	k2i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἠκολούθει ἡμῖν	1	Here, **following** does not seem to mean “to be one of Jesus’ disciples”, since this man was claiming to act in Jesus’ **name**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “he will most certainly receive”
9:41	jjq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ	1	Although the pronouns **he** and **his** are masculine, they are being used here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “that person will certainly not lose his or her reward”
9:41	wnb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
9:42	nhbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces a situation that contrasts with the situation that Jesus described in the previous verse.

9:42	z6k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύλος ὀνικὸς	1	A **millstone** was a round stone used for grinding grain into flour. The phrase **of a donkey** indicates that this kind of **millstone** was heavy enough that it took a **donkey** to turn it. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of stone, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a very large rock” or “a very heavy object”
9:42	bx6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περίκειται & περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that someone would tie the **millstone** around the person’s neck. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “is attached to his neck”

9:43	m3k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σκανδαλίσῃ σε & σου, ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν & σε	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **your** and **you** throughout this verse as well as the command **cut it off** are singular. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who is speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. If you do so, you may also need to make some other words plural.
9:43	gxu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίσῃ σε	1	Here, Jesus is speaking of sinning as if it were stumbling. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causes you to sin”
9:43	qo45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν	1	Here Jesus provides the most extreme response to sinning. He does not mean that this should be the normal way to deal with sin.

9:43	h9lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ζωὴν	1	Here Jesus implies that this **life** is everlasting or undying life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “true life” or “everlasting life”
9:43	wlu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν Γέενναν	1	Here Jesus uses the name **Gehenna** to refer to hell. The valley named **Gehenna** was outside the city of Jerusalem and was a place where people threw out and burned garbage. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a place like the valley of Gehenna” or “hell, which is like Gehenna valley”
9:43	ttl7			εἰς τὸ πῦρ τὸ ἄσβεστον	1	Here, the phrase **the unquenchable fire** refers to **Gehenna**, or hell, and describes it as a very unpleasant place.

Since this verse is identical to [9:44](../09/44.md), those who decide to include it should express the idea as they did there.
9:47	p0ot		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε	1	Jesus is suggesting that this is a hypothetical condition, that the disciples might experience their **eye** causing them to stumble. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a situation that could happen. Alternate translation: “consider this situation: your eye causes you to stumble. If that were to happen”
9:47	okc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε	1	Here, Jesus speaks of **your eye** as if it were a person who could cause **you to stumble**. He means that the **eye** is the part of the body that is involved in the stumbling. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

9:47	lcbs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε, ἔκβαλε αὐτόν & σέ	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **your** and **you** throughout this verse as well as the command **throw it out** are singular. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who is speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. If you do so, you may also need to make some other words plural.
9:47	j65u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίζῃ σε	1	Here, Jesus is speaking of sinning as if it were stumbling. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causes you to sin”
9:47	t7uv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἔκβαλε αὐτόν	1	Here Jesus provides the most extreme response to sinning. He does not mean that this should be the normal way to deal with sin.

He means that it is a very unpleasant place where people experience punishment and pain. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “where it is as if their worm does not end, and it is as if the fire is not quenched” or “which is like a place where their worm does not end and the fire is not quenched”
9:48	sss3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ σκώληξ αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **their** refers to people who are in Gehenna. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “the worm of the people there”
9:48	sss4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ σκώληξ αὐτῶν	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe a **worm** that devours them. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the worm that devours them”

Alternate translation: “worms do not end”
9:48	sss6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	οὐ τελευτᾷ	1	Jesus is referring to death in a polite way by using the word **end**. He means that **the worm** continues to devour the people there because it never dies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a polite way of referring to this in your language, or you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “does not pass away” or “does not die” or “never ceases to devour”

9:49	ma3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πυρὶ ἁλισθήσεται	1	Here Jesus speaks as if people were food or sacrifices that **will be salted with fire**. In Jesus’ culture, people would put salt on their food and on sacrifices that they offered to God. The salt preserved the food and made it taste better. When someone is salted **with fire**, it most likely refers to that person experiencing difficult or painful situations that eventually help and sanctify that person. However, Jesus does not explain the metaphor, and Christians disagree on what it means. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. If necessary, you could state more explicitly that Jesus is referring to some form of suffering and its effects on people. Alternate translation: “will experience something like being salted with fire” or “will suffer as if they were being burned, and that will help them as if they were being salted”
9:49	mlnp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	πυρὶ	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **with fire**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts include the words “and every sacrifice will be salted with salt” after **with fire**.

If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
9:50	qt9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	καλὸν τὸ ἅλας	1	To teach the disciples, Jesus offers a story or illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Listen to this illustration: Salt is good”
9:50	oaep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν & τὸ ἅλας ἄναλον γένηται, ἐν τίνι	1	Jesus means that it is possible for **salt** to become **unsalty**, and he is speaking about what can or cannot happen after **salt** has become **unsalty**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a situation that could happen. Alternate translation: “suppose that the salt becomes unsalty. With what”
9:50	rb7r			ἄναλον γένηται	1	Alternate translation: “loses its salty taste”
9:50	fqb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐν τίνι αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show that no one can make ruined salt salty again. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you cannot season it with anything!” or “you are not able to season it.”\n
9:50	t76n			αὐτὸ ἀρτύσετε	1	Alternate translation: “will you make it taste salty again”
9:50	gims		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀρτύσετε & ἔχετε & εἰρηνεύετε	1	Because Jesus is talking to his disciples, the word **you** and the commands **Have** and **be at peace** are plural.
9:50	f34y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχετε ἐν ἑαυτοῖς ἅλα	1	Here Jesus commands his disciples to have **salt** in themselves. Just as salt makes food better in many ways, so Jesus’ disciples can make the world better in many ways. If possible, preserve the figure of speech or use simile form since it refers back to the illustration Jesus just gave. Alternate translation: “Be like food that has salt in it” or “Help others as if you had salt in yourselves”
9:50	syc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰρηνεύετε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “act peaceably”
10:intro	bq25				0	# Mark 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Jesus instructs his disciples and journeys toward Jerusalem (8:22–10:52)\n      * Jesus teaches about marriage and divorce (10:1–12)\n      * Jesus blesses little children (10:13–16)\n      * Jesus talks with a rich man (10:17–22)\n      * Jesus teaches about wealth, possessions, and the kingdom (10:23–31)\n      * Jesus predicts his death and resurrection (10:32–34)\n      * Jesus and the disciples speak about who will be great (10:35–45)\n      * Jesus heals blind Bartimaeus (10:46–52)\n\nSome translations set quotations farther to the right than the rest of the text to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quotations in [10:6–8](../10/06.md), which are from [Genesis 1:27](../gen/01/27.md) and [Genesis 2:24](../gen/02/24.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Divorce\n\nIn [10:2](../10/02.md), the Pharisees test Jesus by asking him about an issue that was controversial among Jewish religious leaders: divorce. More specifically, the religious leaders argued about whether men could divorce their wives and about what were valid grounds for divorce. So, they ask Jesus about this. When Jesus asks what Moses wrote in the Law, the Pharisees refer to [Deuteronomy 24:1–4](../deu/24/01.md), which assumes that men do divorce their wives. Jesus responds that this section of the Law exists only because the Israelites were stubborn. He means that God knew that the Israelite men would sometimes divorce their wives, so he included a law about how to do it. Then Jesus argues that divorce is never what God wants, and he quotes from Genesis 1 and 2 to prove this. He further says that any divorced person who marries again is involved in adultery. Make sure that it is clear that both Jesus and the Pharisees are making arguments based on the Scriptures.\n\n### Rich people and the kingdom of God\n\nIn Jesus’ culture, many people thought that rich people had been specifically blessed by God. When Jesus said that it was extremely difficult for rich people to enter God’s kingdom (see [10:23–25](../10/23.md)), the disciples were shocked. They thought that if it was hard for rich people to enter the kingdom, it would be impossible for everyone else. That is why they ask the question, “And who is able to be saved?” ([10:26](../10/26.md)). If your readers might not understand why the disciples respond in this way, you may need to include a footnote that explains some of this information.\n\n### Sitting at Jesus’ right and left hand\n\nIn [10:37](../10/37.md) and [10:40](../10/40.md), Jesus and James and John refer to sitting at Jesus’ right hand and at his left hand. They are referring to the places of honor at the right and left side of a king or ruler. The people who sit in these places have authority and are respected the most after the king or ruler. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation. See the notes on these two verses for translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Drinking the cup\n\nIn [10:38–39](../10/38.md), Jesus refers to a “cup” from which he is going to drink. He is using a figure of speech from the Old Testament that refers to experiencing suffering and pain (for example, see [Psalm 75:8](../psa/75/08.md) and [Isaiah 51:17](../isa/51/17.md)). He means that he will experience suffering, and his disciples must be ready to experience it as well. Since this figure of speech is from the Old Testament, if possible you should preserve it or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Being baptized with a baptism\n\nIn [10:38–39](../10/38.md), Jesus refers to a “baptism” with which he and his disciples will be “baptized.” He means that, just as people who are baptized are covered with water, he and his disciples will be overwhelmed by suffering and difficult circumstances. Since baptism is an important concept in the Bible, if possible you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in conversations, and many of the conversations are with one person. Because of this, the majority of the forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. So, you should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 5, 19, and 35. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

10:1	qq93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἔρχεται	1	Mark is referring to Jesus to represent both Jesus and his disciples, who traveled with Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he, along with his disciples, goes”

10:3	m7ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν αὐτοῖς, τί ὑμῖν ἐνετείλατο Μωϋσῆς?	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “asked them what Moses commanded them.”
10:3	l74d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ὑμῖν ἐνετείλατο Μωϋσῆς	1	Here Jesus is referring to what the Law that God gave the Israelites through **Moses** includes about divorce.

This passage discusses divorce and remarriage, and it mentions the use of **a certificate of divorce**. The Pharisees interpreted this passage to mean that men could divorce their wives, but they had to use **a certificate of divorce**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “In the Law, Moses permitted a husband to write a certificate of divorce and then to divorce his wife”
10:4	vpgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βιβλίον ἀποστασίου γράψαι	1	Here the Pharisees imply that the husband must also give the **certificate of divorce** to his wife.

Alternate translation: “But from the beginning of creation, as the Scriptures say, God made them male and female. The Scriptures say further that, because of this, a man will leave his father and mother, and the two will be one flesh. So then, I tell you that they are no longer two, but one flesh”
10:6	nk5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ & ἀρχῆς κτίσεως	1	Here, the phrase **from the beginning of creation** refers to when God created everything that exists.

10:8	p7yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκέτι εἰσὶν δύο, ἀλλὰ μία σάρξ	1	Here Jesus repeats in different form the words from the figure of speech at the end of the quotation earlier in this verse. He means that a husband and wife are so closely joined that it is as if they had **one flesh** or one body between them. Express the idea as you did earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “it is as if they are no longer two, but they are like one flesh” or “they are no longer two separate people, but are as closely united as possible”
10:9	o491		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion or inference based on what Jesus has said about marriage.

10:10	l8fu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τούτου	1	The word **this** refers to the conversation that Jesus just had with the Pharisees about divorce.

10:11	i5kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄλλην	1	Jesus is using the adjective **another** as a noun to mean another woman. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “another person”
10:11	cosl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μοιχᾶται ἐπ’ αὐτήν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **adultery**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “becomes an adulterer against her” or “does what is adulterous against her”

10:13	zx1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces a new event. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “And it happened that” or “After this,”
10:13	nmw7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	προσέφερον	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to people in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers generally to people. Alternate translation: “other people were bringing”
10:13	pk8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	αὐτῶν ἅψηται	1	In Mark’s culture, when Jesus would**touch** the little children, that would express God’s love for them and convey God’s blessing to them.

Alternate translation: “Of the ones such as these is the kingdom of God, so permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them”
10:14	yi5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἄφετε τὰ παιδία ἔρχεσθαι πρός με, καὶ μὴ κωλύετε αὐτά	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than and in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses. Alternate translation: “Permit the little children to come to me; yes, do not forbid them” or “Permit the little children to come to me”
10:14	a4wj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἄφετε & μὴ κωλύετε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to his disciples, the commands **Permit** and **do not forbid** are plural.
10:14	qj7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχεσθαι	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “to go”

10:14	jq4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῶν & τοιούτων	1	The pronoun **these** refers to the little children. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to the little children more directly. Alternate translation: “of the ones such as these little children”
10:14	gq3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	τῶν & τοιούτων	1	Jesus is referring to **the little children** and to people who are like them.

10:15	e08x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1	Because Jesus is speaking to his disciples, the word **you** here is plural.

10:15	a1e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς παιδίον	1	Jesus is saying that his disciples should be like **a little child** because little children are humble and thankfully receive gifts.

10:15	q3ck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
10:16	jq4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τιθεὶς τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ αὐτά	1	In Mark’s culture, when Jesus placed his hands on the little children, that expressed God’s love for them and conveyed God’s blessing to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a similar action from your culture, or you could explain what having laid his hands on them means.

If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a man ran up to him. He knelt before him and was asking him”
10:17	oh92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	γονυπετήσας αὐτὸν	1	In this man’s culture, kneeling down before a person was a way to honor a greater person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a similar action from your culture, or you could explain what kneeling down means. Alternate translation: “having prostrated himself before him” or “having bowed down to him in respect”
10:17	fpp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω	1	Here the man speaks as if he were a child who would receive property from a relative.

10:17	h45i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of life, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I might be able to live eternally”
10:18	kjkd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces what Jesus said in contrast to what the man said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “However,”

Alternate translation: “No one is good except one—God. So, why are you calling me good?”
10:18	lw1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the man for calling another human **good** without thinking carefully about it. Jesus is not denying that he is **good**, but he wants the man to think about it more carefully. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are calling me good without thinking carefully.” or “You do not understand what you are saying when you call me good!”
10:18	gyod		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause.

The first four commands and the sixth command come from either [Exodus 20:12–16](../exo/20/12.md) or [Deuteronomy 5:16–20](../deu/05/16.md). The fifth command is not directly quoted from the law that God gave Moses, but it may be a summary of the command found in [Exodus 20:17](../exo/20/17.md) or [Deuteronomy 5:21](../deu/05/21.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could format these words in a different way and include this information in a footnote.

10:19	hj3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ μοιχεύσῃς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **adultery**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “do not be an adulterer or adulteress” or “do not do what is adulterous”
10:20	qlbg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then”
10:20	bd3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ νεότητός μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **youth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “since the time when I was a young man” or “from when I was a child”
10:21	ocri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened.

10:21	a0hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	3	Here, the word and introduces the result that will follow if the man does **sell** what he owns and **give to the poor**.

10:21	z24n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	Many ancient manuscripts do not include any words after **follow me**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts include the words “having taken up the cross” after the words **follow me**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
10:22	dxbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces how the man reacted in contrast to what Jesus said.

Alternate translation: “because he was having many possessions, having become downcast at this word, he went away being grieved”
10:22	i5v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	στυγνάσας	1	Here, the phrase **having become downcast** indicates that the man became sad and mournful.

10:22	afu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ λόγῳ	1	Here, **word** represents what Jesus just said using words.

Alternate translation: “Jesus’ statement” or “the words that Jesus said”
10:22	rczv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λυπούμενος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “being very sorrowful”

Alternate translation: “You see that the ones having riches very difficultly enter into the kingdom of God!” or “Only with difficulty do the ones having riches enter into the kingdom of God!”
10:24	zqje		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ & μαθηταὶ ἐθαμβοῦντο ἐπὶ τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say what did the action, it is clear from the context that it was Jesus’ **words**. Alternate translation: “his words astonished the disciples”
10:24	z9z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς	1	Here, the word **answering** indicates that Jesus is responding to how the disciples reacted to what he had said. He is not responding to something that they said to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “responding to their astonishment” or “in response”
10:24	fh1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνα	1	Here Jesus calls his disciples **Children** to indicate that they are under his spiritual care and that he cares for them.

Alternate translation: “My dear disciples” or “Young men”
10:24	izt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἐστιν & εἰσελθεῖν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **it is to enter**. The ULT follows that reading.

Jesus does this to emphasize how hard it is for **a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God**. As [10:27](../10/27.md) shows, Jesus does not think that this is completely impossible, however. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea here in such a way that it does not sound as if it is totally impossible for **a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God**. Alternate translation: “Consider how difficult it is for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle. That illustrates how difficult it is for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God”
10:25	t4y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τρυμαλιᾶς ῥαφίδος	1	The phrase **an eye of a needle** refers to the small hole at the end of a sewing needle through which the thread passes. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of tool or the hole in it, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term for a small opening. Alternate translation: “the small hole at the end of a needle” or “a very small hole”

If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was what Jesus said. Alternate translation: “what the disciples heard astonished them greatly, and they said”
10:26	mba6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	πρὸς αὐτόν	1	Some ancient manuscripts read **to him**. The ULT follows that reading.

10:26	fjex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι?	1	The disciples are using the question form to express their astonishment. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “So it seems that no one is able to be saved.” or “So no one is able to be saved!”
10:26	fn25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τίς δύναται σωθῆναι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

10:28	hcv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** is meant to draw the attention of Jesus.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for commands, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “I command that because”
10:45	ctta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου & αὐτοῦ	1	Here Jesus speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. Alternate translation: “I, who am the Son of Man, … my”
10:45	h0j5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐκ ἦλθεν διακονηθῆναι, ἀλλὰ διακονῆσαι, καὶ δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the two clauses here. Alternate translation: “came to serve and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many, not to be served”
10:45	pmk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἦλθεν	1	Here, the word **come** refers to the Son of Man entering this world as a human to do what God called him to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “did not come to this world” or “is not acting”
10:45	a3fr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διακονηθῆναι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “for people to serve him” or “to have people serve him”
10:45	rik1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ διακονῆσαι	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but he came to serve”
10:45	d9jd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ λύτρον ἀντὶ πολλῶν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if his **life** were a price or **ransom** he would **give** to free **many** from someone or something that owned or controlled them. He means that he will obtain forgiveness for his people’s sins and will keep those sins from controlling them. This is an important biblical image, so if possible preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “to offer his life as if it were a ransom to set many free from sin”
10:45	c46w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to allow himself to die”
10:45	xuny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many men and women”
10:46	thxd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Later,”

If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man sitting beside the road. His name was Bartimaeus, son of Timaeus. He was a blind beggar”
10:46	iosi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ υἱὸς Τιμαίου, Βαρτιμαῖος, τυφλὸς προσαίτης	1	Here, the phrase **son of Timaeus** could: (1) identify the father of **Bartimaeus**.

10:47	ynr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Υἱὲ Δαυεὶδ	1	Here, the word **Son** means a male descendant. It does not mean that Jesus was the direct son of David. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Descendant of David” or “You who are descended from David”
10:47	vwz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Υἱὲ Δαυεὶδ	1	**David** was Israel’s most important king, and God had promised him that one of his descendants would be the Messiah. So the title **Son of David** implicitly meant “Messiah.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Messiah”
10:47	s2dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἐλέησόν με	1	The phrase **have mercy** is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add a word such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “I ask that you have mercy on me”
10:47	ylls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐλέησόν με	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **mercy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “be merciful to me”
10:47	tvkh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλέησόν με	1	The Bartimaeus assumes that Jesus will know that he is asking to be healed.

10:48	ca5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὶ	1	Mark is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many men”

10:48	l86a			Υἱὲ Δαυείδ, ἐλέησόν με	1	Here Bartimaeus says the same thing he said in [10:47](../10/47.md) except he does not include the name Jesus. Express the idea as you did there. Alternate translation: “Descendant of David, I ask that you be merciful to me” or “You who are descended from David, please have mercy on me and heal me”
10:49	pgfm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν, φωνήσατε αὐτόν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “said to call him”
10:49	po5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	φωνήσατε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to some of the people in the crowd, the command **Call** is plural.
10:49	ac7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	φωνοῦσι	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to people in the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “some people in the crowd called” or “some people in the front of the crowd called”
10:49	n6xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	θάρσει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **courage**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Be courageous”
10:49	py8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγειρε	1	Here the people who are speaking to Bartimaeus imply that he should walk to where Jesus was after getting up. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Get up and walk over to him” or “Get up and go to where he is”
10:50	rhrr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποβαλὼν τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ	1	Bartimaeus’ **coat** would have been an outer garment that people could ordinarily take off in public. Bartimaeus probably took it off so that it would be easier for him to hurry to where Jesus was. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make some or all of that information more explicit. Alternate translation: “having thrown aside his jacket” or “having thrown aside his coat so that he could move faster”
10:50	bf2a			ἀναπηδήσας	1	Alternate translation: “having quickly gotten to his feet” or “having immediately stood up”
10:50	jc66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθεν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “went”

10:51	fcin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Ραββουνεί, ἵνα	1	Bartimaeus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

10:51	ish0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναβλέψω	1	Here, Bartimaeus could be implying: (1) that he once could see, and he wants to be able to see once more. Alternate translation: “I might regain my sight” (2) that he wants to be able to see for the first time. Alternate translation: “I might gain my sight” or “I might be able to see”
10:52	bjuw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “You believed, and that has caused you to be saved”

Alternate translation: “he became his disciple” or “he traveled with him on the road as his student”
11:intro	xg3t				0	# Mark 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Jesus in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n      * Jesus enters Jerusalem (11:1–11)\n      * Jesus curses a fig tree, part one (11:12–14)\n      * Jesus drives people out of the temple (11:15–19)\n      * Jesus curses a fig tree, part two (11:20–26)\n      * Jesus debates with the Jewish leaders about authority (11:27–33)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [11:9–10](../mrk/11/09.md), which includes a quotation from [Psalm 118:26](../psa/118/26.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The young donkey\n\nIn [11:1–11](../11/01.md), Mark narrates how Jesus rode on a colt, or young donkey, when he entered into Jerusalem. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all write about this event. Mark and Luke write that the disciples brought Jesus a colt. John writes that Jesus found a donkey. Matthew writes that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey and a colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1–7](../mat/21/01.md), [Mark 11:1–7](../mrk/11/01.md), [Luke 19:29–36](../luk/19/29.md), and [John 12:14–15](../jhn/12/14.md))\n\n### Hosanna\n\nThe word “Hosanna” is a Hebrew word spelled out how it sounds in Mark’s language. The word means “save us, please.” By the time of Jesus, however, people would use the word to praise or honor God and others. Consider whether to spell the word out as it sounds or state its meaning. See the notes on [11:9](../11/09.md) and [11:10](../11/10.md) for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Disrupting activity in the temple area\n\nIn [11:15–17](../11/15.md), Jesus disrupts normal activity in the temple by driving out some people and by overturning the chairs and tables of others. Jesus performed this symbolic action to express a specific message. However, Christians debate exactly what the symbolic action means. Jesus could have been protesting against people who were buying and selling dishonestly. He could have been protesting against all buying and selling in the temple area. He could have been indicating that the temple would be destroyed. Your translation should state what Jesus did while allowing for all of these possible interpretations.\n\n### The baptism of John\n\nIn [11:29–33](../11/29.md), Jesus and the chief priests, scribes, and elders discuss “the baptism of John.” Here they are referring to how John baptized people for repentance. Jesus asks them whether they think that John’s baptism came from heaven or from people, which means that he performed baptisms by God’s authority or by human authority. The Jewish leaders decide not to answer the question. See the notes on these verses for ways to refer to John’s baptism and to the authority behind it.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 2, 4, 7, 15, 21, 22, 27, and 33. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### Verse 26\n\nMany of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [11:26](../11/26.md). A few early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words: “But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in the heavens forgive your trespasses.” Since a similar sentence appears in [Matthew 6:15](../mat/06/15.md), it is likely that people who copied the manuscripts accidentally or intentionally added these words here in Mark. Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
11:1	djir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ὅτε	1	Here, the phrase **And when** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event. Alternate translation: “Then”

11:1	so0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν	1	Here Matthew implies that **Bethphage** and **Bethany** are near **the Mount of Olives**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “near the Mount of Olives” or “which are at the Mount of Olives”
11:2	bi22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ὑπάγετε	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “Come” instead of **Go**. Alternate translation: “Come”
11:2	ahrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν κώμην τὴν κατέναντι ὑμῶν	1	Here, a **village** that is **opposite** someone means that it is directly in front of them. Jesus could be referring to Bethany, Bethphage, or some other village. However, it is most likely that he is referring to the village of Bethphage. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the village directly in front of you” or “the village of Bethphage, which is before you”
11:2	si41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ὑμῶν & εὑρήσετε	1	Since the word **you** applies to the two disciples in both of these instances, it would be dual, if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.
11:2	g1qx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πῶλον δεδεμένον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “a donkey that is not yet fully grown” or “a young riding animal”
11:2	mwwv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δεδεμένον	1	Here Jesus implies that someone has used a rope or tether to secure the donkey so that it cannot wander away. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “secured with a tether”
11:2	yw78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐδεὶς ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Mark is using the word here in a generic sense, that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “no human” or “no one person”
11:2	zloo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὔπω ἐκάθισεν	1	Jesus is using the term **sat** to refer to riding on an animal by association with the way people sit on an animal they are riding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “has yet mounted” or “has yet used as a mount”
11:3	aw3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ, τί ποιεῖτε τοῦτο? εἴπατε, ὅτι ὁ Κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει, καὶ εὐθὺς αὐτὸν ἀποστέλλει πάλιν ὧδε	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there are not quotations within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And if anyone asks you why you are doing this, say that the Lord has need of it and that immediately he sends it back here.”
11:3	q446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ποιεῖτε	1	The person would be speaking to the two disciples, so **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural.
11:3	xw55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ποιεῖτε τοῦτο?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say explicitly what the phrase **doing this** refers to. Alternate translation: “Why are you untying and taking the colt”
11:3	j1w3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Κύριος αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει, καὶ εὐθὺς αὐτὸν ἀποστέλλει πάλιν ὧδε.	1	Here, the clause **and immediately he sends it back here** could be: (1) part of what Jesus wants the disciples to say. Alternate translation: “The Lord has need of it, and immediately the Lord sends it back here to you” (2) what Jesus predicts the person asking the question **Why are you doing this?** will do. Alternate translation: “The Lord has need of it,’ and immediately that person again sends it here”
11:3	k7fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	αὐτοῦ χρείαν ἔχει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **need**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “requires it”
11:3	yj5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἀποστέλλει	1	Here Jesus uses the present tense to describe a future action that will happen very soon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use whatever tense is natural in your language for referring to an event in the near future. Alternate translation: “he will send”
11:3	ehde		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	πάλιν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **back**. The ULT follows that reading. In this case, it is more likely that the phrase **and immediately he sends it** is part of what Jesus wanted the disciples to say (see previous note on this whole sentence). Other ancient manuscripts do not include the word **back**. In this case, it is more likely that the phrase **and immediately he sends it** is what Jesus predicts that the people who asked the question will do (see previous note on this whole sentence). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
11:4	y381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπῆλθον	1	Here, **they** refers to the two disciples mentioned in [11:1](../11/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to them more explicitly. Alternate translation: “those two disciples went away”

11:5	psls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἔλεγον αὐτοῖς, τί ποιεῖτε λύοντες τὸν πῶλον	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “were asking them what they were doing by untying the colt.”
11:5	wwup		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ποιεῖτε λύοντες	1	Here the people asking the question are asking the two disciples to provide a good reason for why they are **untying the colt**.

11:7	k9g7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὰ ἱμάτια	1	The word **cloaks** refers to outer garments. You could translate this with the name of an outer garment that your readers would recognize or with a general expression. Alternate translation: “jackets” or “outer garments”
11:8	jk2o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὶ & ἄλλοι	1	Mark is using the adjectives **many** and **others** as nouns to mean many people and other people.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should have paid closer attention to what has been written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations.’” or “It has certainly been written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations’!”
11:17	le3k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	οὐ γέγραπται	1	In Jesus’ culture, **Has it not been written** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the book of Isaiah (see [Isaiah 56:7](../isa/56/07.md)).

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words.

Alternatively, you could combine the two phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “believes that what he says is happening without doubting in his heart” or “truly believes in his heart that what he says is happening”
11:23	y76p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	In Jesus’ culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

11:24	c61c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	πάντα ὅσα προσεύχεσθε	1	The expression **everything, as much as you pray** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “everything that you pray”
11:24	hunm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	προσεύχεσθε καὶ αἰτεῖσθε	1	The two words **pray** and **request** express a single idea. The word **pray** tells how the disciples are making their requests. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a different way. Alternate translation: “you request in prayer” or “you request while praying”
11:24	abke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἐλάβετε	1	Here Jesus uses the past tense to refer to something in the future. He does this to indicate that the disciples should **believe** so strongly that they will receive what they ask for that it is as if they had already **received** it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the present or future tense and indicate the certainty in other way. Alternate translation: “you will certainly receive it” or “you are certain to receive it”

11:25	m7xi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ὅταν στήκετε προσευχόμενοι	1	In Jesus’ culture, people often would **stand** when **praying** to God. Jesus assumes that his readers would be familiar with this practice.

11:25	jjs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Jesus says to **forgive** with the goal that **your Father who {is} in the heavens may also forgive you your trespasses.** Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that”
11:25	m2aw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	Jesus speaks of his disciples as if God were their physical father. He means that they have a father-son relationship with God.

The notes below discuss translation issues in this verse, for those who decide to include it.
11:26	q3gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἀφίετε	1	Here Jesus implies that they might **not forgive** other people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “do not forgive fellow humans” or “do not forgive people who have sinned against you”
11:26	alh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	See how you translated the phrase **your Father** in the previous verse ([11:25](../11/25.md)). Alternate translation: “your spiritual Father” or “God, who is like a Father to you,”

11:27	alh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Here Mark means that Jesus was walking in the **temple** area. He does not mean that Jesus was in the most sacred parts of the temple building. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. See you translated this word in [11:11](../11/11.md). Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard”
11:28	se9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιεῖς? ἢ, τίς σοι ἔδωκεν τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην, ἵνα ταῦτα ποιῇς	1	The question **By what authority do you do these things** and the question **who gave you this authority, so that you might do these things** could: (1) be two separate questions, the first asking about the nature of the authority and the second about who gave it to Jesus. Alternate translation: “By what kind of authority do you do these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority, so that you might do these things” (2) both have the same meaning and be asked together to strongly question Jesus’ authority. If you choose this option, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these two questions into one question. Alternate translation: “Who was it who gave you the authority to do these things?”
11:28	ooxp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιεῖς? ἢ, τίς σοι ἔδωκεν τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of authority, you could express the same idea in another way.

11:28	h8gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ποιεῖς & σοι & ποιῇς	1	Because the Jewish leaders are speaking to Jesus, the word **you** throughout this verse is singular.
11:28	uggx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα ποιεῖς & ταῦτα ποιῇς	1	In both places, the phrase **these things** refers to what Jesus has done since he arrived in Jerusalem, including driving people out of the temple, healing people, and teaching. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “do you teach, heal, and drive people out of the temple … you teach, heal, and drive people out of the temple”
11:28	fs6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	Here, the word **or** introduces another similar question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a related question, or you could leave **or** untranslated. Alternate translation: “and” or “or again,”
11:29	w96w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces what Jesus said in contrast to what the Jewish leaders asked him.

11:29	aak2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἕνα λόγον	1	Jesus is using the term **word** to refer to what he will ask. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “one thing”
11:29	jyq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἀποκρίθητέ μοι, καὶ ἐρῶ ὑμῖν	1	Here Jesus implies that he will only **tell** them **by what authority** he acts if they **answer** him.

12:intro	ne55				0	# Mark 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Jesus in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n      * The parable of the vineyard (12:1–12)\n      * Jesus interacts with the religious leaders (12:13–37)\n        * Jesus debates with the Pharisees and Herodians about taxes (12:13–17)\n        * Jesus debates with the Sadducees about the resurrection (12:18–27)\n        * Jesus speaks with a scribe about the greatest commandment (12:28–34)\n        * Jesus teaches about the Christ (12:35–37)\n      * Jesus warns against the scribe (12:38–40)\n      * Jesus teaches about a widow who gave her little money to God (12:41–44)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [12:10–11](../12/10.md), which is a quotation from [Psalm 118:22–23](../psa/118/22.md), and the poetry in [12:36](../12/36.md), which is a quotation from [Psalm 110:1](../psa/110/01.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Renting out a vineyard\n\nIn [12:1–12](../12/01.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who built a vineyard and then rented it out to farmers. Jesus is referring to a common arrangement in which a wealthy person who owned property would have poorer people use that property for farming or tending grapes. These poorer people would do the work and then sell the produce, and they would give the person who owned the property a portion of what they made. If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of arrangement, make sure that your translation is clear about what is happening in the story.\n\n### The poll tax\n\nThe word translated “poll tax” refers to a specific amount of money that each adult person had to pay to the government. In Jesus’ time period, the Roman government required Jewish adults to pay a high tax. The Pharisees ask whether this tax that the Roman government required contradicted the law that God gave Moses. Make sure that your readers understand that the Pharisees are asking about a tax that the Roman government required each adult Jewish person to pay.\n\n### A man marrying his brother’s widow\n\nIn [12:19–23](../12/19.md), the Sadducees question Jesus in regard to a hypothetical situation in which a woman marries seven brothers in succession. This situation is based on a command in the Jewish law that can be found in [Deuteronomy 25:5–6](../deu/25/05.md). The law requires a woman who is widowed without children to marry a brother of her late husband. The first child that they have together will be considered the child of the dead man. In this way, that man’s family line would continue. The Sadducees present an extreme application of this law, with seven brothers successively marrying the same woman and dying without having children. They use this example to try to make the idea of resurrection look strange or silly. Make sure that your readers understand the example that the Sadducees present.\n\n### The great commandment\n\nJewish teachers sometimes debated which specific commandment was the greatest or most important one. This was important because, if commandments seemed to contradict each other in a specific situation, the greater one would be the correct one to obey. When the scribe asks Jesus about “the first commandment” in [12:28](../12/28.md), he wants Jesus to offer an opinion about this debate. Make sure that your readers understand that this is what the scribe is asking about.\n\n### King David and the Christ\n\nIn [12:35–37](../12/35.md), Jesus asks the people he is teaching about whether the Christ can be a descendant of David if David himself calls the Messiah “Lord” in [Psalm 110:1](../psa/110/01.md). Since people in David’s culture called older and more important people “lord,” it does not make sense for David to call his own descendant “Lord.” When Jesus asks and teaches about this, he implies that the Christ is indeed King David’s descendant, but he is also more than that. Make sure that this teaching about calling the Christ “Lord” is clear to your readers.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The parable of the vineyard\n\nIn [12:1–12](../12/01.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who planted a vineyard and rented it out to farmers. When the man sends servants to collect the rent, the farmers refuse and injure or kill the servants. When the man sends his own son, the farmers kill him as well. So, man came and destroyed the farmers and rented the vineyard to other people. When he tells this story, Jesus implies that the Jewish religious leaders are like those farmers who will be destroyed. Jesus also implies that the vineyard represents the people of Israel, the servants represent God’s messengers, the son represents Jesus himself, and the man who owned the vineyard represents God. While you should not explain the meaning more than Jesus does, make sure that your translation fits with what Jesus is illustrating. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The stone\n\nIn [12:10–11](../12/10.md), Jesus quotes from [Psalm 118:22–23](../psa/118/22.md), which refers to a specific “stone.” In the Psalm, this stone most likely represents the king of Israel, or it perhaps represents the Israelite people in general. When Jesus quotes this passage, he is implicitly identifying himself with the stone. Since the stone language comes from a quotation from the Psalms, you should preserve it in some form in your translation. Also, since Jesus does not explicitly claim to be the stone, you should keep that implicit in your translation. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in questions that people ask of Jesus or in speeches that Jesus directs to individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 13, 14, 16, 18, and 41. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n

12:9	kdyx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe a **lord** who owns **the vineyard**.

He speaks of this person gaining power and respect as if he became **the head of the corner**. Jesus is applying this quotation to himself, identifying himself with the **stone**. However, if possible, preserve the metaphor in your translation, or if that is not possible, express the idea in simile form.

Also, the reason why they **left** Jesus without arresting him was because **they feared the crowd**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put the reasons before their results. Alternate translation: “And they knew that he spoke the parable against them, so they were seeking to seize him. However, they feared the crowd, so having left him, they went away”
12:12	b1vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐζήτουν	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders mentioned in [11:27](../11/27.md).

12:13	s1hb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Here, **word** represents something said in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in speech”

Alternate translation: “since you do not look at the face of men, it is not a concern to you about anyone”
12:14	cp3x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός	1	The Herodians and the Pharisees use this clause to say that Jesus does not care what others think and say about him.

12:14	r2f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μέλει σοι περὶ οὐδενός	1	The words translated **not** and **anyone** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative.

12:14	weaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the Herodians and the Pharisees are using the possessive form to describe a **way** that **God** desires or approves of.

12:15	wl34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δηνάριον	1	A **denarius** was a silver coin equivalent to about one day’s wage for a hired worker. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “a silver coin” or “a coin worth one day’s wage”
12:16	ev6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people who were there, more specifically the Herodians and the disciples of the Pharisees.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “They are of Caesar, the man who rules the Roman empire”
12:17	fl4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ Καίσαρος ἀπόδοτε Καίσαρι	1	Here, **Caesar** represents the Roman leaders and government in general. See how you translated this word in [12:14](../12/14.md), but make sure that the connection to the answer “Caesar’s” in [12:16](../12/16.md) is clear. Alternate translation: “The things of the Roman leaders, give back to the Roman leaders” or “The things of the Roman empire, give back to the Roman empire”

12:18	ss09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	Σαδδουκαῖοι & οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	This phrase is identifying the **Sadducees** as a group of Jews that said no one would rise from the dead. It is not identifying the Sadducees who came to question Jesus as members of that group who held that belief, as if other members did not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that makes that more explicit. Alternate translation: “Sadducees, men who believe that no one will rise from the dead”
12:18	rdl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **resurrection**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “that people do not resurrect”\n

Alternate translation: “Moses wrote to us in the book of Deuteronomy” or “Moses declared to us in the Law”
12:19	hhmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἔγραψεν ἡμῖν, ὅτι ἐάν τινος ἀδελφὸς ἀποθάνῃ, καὶ καταλίπῃ γυναῖκα καὶ μὴ ἀφῇ τέκνον, ἵνα λάβῃ ὁ ἀδελφὸς αὐτοῦ τὴν γυναῖκα, καὶ ἐξαναστήσῃ σπέρμα τῷ ἀδελφῷ αὐτοῦ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “wrote to us, ‘If someone’s brother dies and leaves behind a wife but does not leave a child, his brother should take the wife and raise up seed for his brother’”
12:19	m8fh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἔγραψεν ἡμῖν	1	Here, the word **us** would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. The Sadducees mean “us Jews,” and they are speaking to Jesus, who is also a Jew.

The first child that they had would be considered offspring of the man’s deceased brother. That way, the deceased brother’s family line could continue. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit in your translation, or you could include some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “his brother should marry the widow and raise up seed with her. The first child will continue the dead man’s family line”

12:21	tbzw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ὁ τρίτος ὡσαύτως	1	The Sadducees are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

12:23	yidn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει, ὅταν ἀναστῶσιν	1	The terms **resurrection** and **rise again** mean similar things.

12:24	wb1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	οὐ & πλανᾶσθε	1	Because Jesus is speaking to the Sadducees, the word **you** here is plural.
12:24	tpkq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	διὰ τοῦτο & μὴ εἰδότες	1	Here, the word **this** refers directly ahead to the phrase **not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God**. Jesus expresses the idea in this way because it was powerful in his language. If using the word **this** to refer to what someone is about to say would be redundant in your language, you could omit the redundant information and make the expression powerful in another way. Alternate translation: “because you do not know”
12:24	i8il		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **power**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the powerful things that God can do”

12:25	pi8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to what is currently the case on earth. Jesus is using this contrast to show the Sadducees that they were mistaken to think that the existence of men and women in heaven would follow the same pattern or order of things as had their former lives on earth. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but rather”
12:25	asw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἀλλ’ εἰσὶν ὡς ἄγγελοι ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Jesus is saying that when people rise from the dead, they are **like angels** because neither of them marry.

And you will love the Lord your God from your whole heart, and from your whole soul, and from your whole mind, and from your whole strength.’”
12:29-30	yop8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐστίν, ἄκουε, Ἰσραήλ, Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν Κύριος εἷς ἐστιν & καὶ ἀγαπήσεις Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου, ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς διανοίας σου, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ἰσχύος σου	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “is that Israel should hear that the Lord their God is one Lord and that they should love the Lord their God from their whole heart, and from their whole soul, and from their whole mind, and from their whole strength.”
12:29	l4h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἄκουε	1	Here, the word **Hear** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

12:29	mq92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Ἰσραήλ	1	Here, the word **Israel** refers to the people who are descended from a man named **Israel**. This man’s other name was Jacob. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “Israelites” or “descendants of Israel”
12:29	kspb			Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν Κύριος εἷς ἐστιν	1	Alternate translation: “the Lord our God, the Lord is one” or “the Lord is our God, the Lord is one”
12:29	mmtb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Κύριος ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν Κύριος εἷς ἐστιν	1	The phrase **the Lord our God is one Lord** could be: (1) an affirmation that **the Lord our God** is the only one whom the Israelites honored and worshiped as **Lord** and God. Alternate translation: “the Lord our God is our only Lord” or “the only Lord is the Lord our God” (2) an affirmation of the uniqueness of **the Lord our God**. Alternate translation: “the Lord our God is a unique Lord”
12:30	vllb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀγαπήσεις & σου & σου & σου & σου & σου	1	Since in this command God is addressing each specific person who is part of God’s people, the words **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse.
12:30	thj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1	The author of the quotation is using the future form to give a command.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with all of who you are” or “with your entire being”
12:30	q49v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου	1	In Mark’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “from all your desires” or “with all your feelings”
12:30	m8hi			ἐξ & ἐξ & ἐξ & ἐξ	1	Alternate translation: “with … with … with … with”
12:30	x3n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ψυχῆς σου	1	Here, **soul** represents a person’s life with special focus on that person’s identity and actions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with everything you are” or “from all your inclinations”
12:30	mii2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ἰσχύος σου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **strength**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from how strong you are” or “with everything that you are able to do”
12:31	fz8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δευτέρα	1	Here, the scribe is using the word **second** to refer to what is the second most important thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The next most significant” or “The second greatest”
12:31	eu8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	δευτέρα	1	Jesus is using the adjective **second** as a noun to mean the second commandment. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “The second commandment”
12:31	oegh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	δευτέρα	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “Number two”
12:31	gpjq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	αὕτη, ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν	1	Here Jesus quotes from the Old Testament scriptures, specifically from [Leviticus 19:18](../lev/19/18.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could format these words in a different way and include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “is this commandment from the book of Leviticus: ‘You will love your neighbor as yourself.’”
12:31	xoom		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	αὕτη, ἀγαπήσεις τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “is that one should love one’s neighbor as oneself.”
12:31	k0l4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀγαπήσεις & σου & σεαυτόν	1	Since in this command God is addressing each specific person who is part of God’s people, the words **You**, **your**, and **yourself** are singular.

12:31	np4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡς σεαυτόν	1	The author of the quotation is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “as you love yourself”
12:31	c3gm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς σεαυτόν	1	The author of the quotation assumes that people love themselves, so he wants these people to love their neighbors just as much. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as deeply as yourself”
12:31	p1ec			μείζων τούτων ἄλλη ἐντολὴ οὐκ ἔστιν	1	Alternate translation: “All other commandments are less important than these”
12:31	gvrv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἄλλη ἐντολὴ οὐκ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **commandment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “nothing that God commanded us that is”
12:31	pyc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τούτων	1	Here, the word **these** refers to the two commandments that Jesus has just quoted. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “those two commandments”
12:32	uhgy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καλῶς	1	Here the scribe implies that he thinks that Jesus answered the question **Well**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “You have answered well”
12:32	qqm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπ’ ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Based on what is true” or “You have spoken what is true when”
12:32	iysp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	εἷς ἐστιν, καὶ οὐκ ἔστιν ἄλλος πλὴν αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “he is one, that is, there is no other besides him” or “he is one; indeed, there is no other besides him”
12:32	awe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἷς ἐστιν	1	Here, just as in [12:29](../12/29.md), the phrase **he is one** could be: (1) an affirmation that God is the only one whom the Israelites honored and worshiped as God. Alternate translation: “he is our only God” or “he alone is God” (2) an affirmation of the uniqueness of God. Alternate translation: “he is unique”
12:32	oxtp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐστιν & αὐτοῦ	1	The pronouns **he** and **him** refer to God. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to him more directly. Alternate translation: “God is … God”
12:32	as2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄλλος	1	The scribe is using the adjective **other** as a noun to mean another god. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “other god”
12:33	ddr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς συνέσεως, καὶ ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ἰσχύος	1	Here, the scribe is referring to all of a human being by naming multiple parts of it. See how you expressed the similar idea in [12:30](../12/30.md). Alternate translation: “with all of who one is” or “with the entire being”
12:33	v8yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας	1	See how you translated the similar phrase in [12:30](../12/30.md). Alternate translation: “from all the desires” or “with all one’s feelings”
12:33	vxeh			ἐξ	-1	Alternate translation: “with … with … with”
12:33	xnq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς συνέσεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **understanding**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from everything that one understands” or “with the whole mind”
12:33	k42a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ὅλης τῆς ἰσχύος	1	See how you translated the similar phrase in [12:30](../12/30.md). Alternate translation: “from how strong one is” or “with everything that one is able to do”\n
12:33	ekfy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡς ἑαυτὸν	1	The scribe is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. See how you expressed the similar idea in [12:31](../12/31.md). Alternate translation: “as one love oneself”
12:33	mje6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἑαυτὸν	1	See how you expressed this idea in [12:31](../12/31.md). Alternate translation: “as deeply as oneself”
12:33	ll9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περισσότερόν ἐστιν	1	Here the scribe means that keeping these two commandments is **more** important or significant than offering **burnt offerings and sacrifices**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “is even more important than” or “is more significant than”
12:33	sgbu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πάντων τῶν ὁλοκαυτωμάτων καὶ θυσιῶν	1	The terms **whole burnt offerings** and **sacrifices** mean similar things. The scribe is using the two terms together to include **all** the different kinds of sacrifices and offerings in his claim. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “all the various offerings” or “all sacrifices that anyone might offer”
12:34	hkf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἰδὼν αὐτὸν ὅτι	1	Here, Mark is using the word **seen** to mean “observed” or “knew.” He is describing something a person would perceive with their mind by association with their eyes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “having understood that” or “having observed that”
12:34	is4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ μακρὰν εἶ ἀπὸ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Jesus speaks as if the man was physically **not far from the kingdom of God**. He means that the man is almost part of God’s kingdom. Jesus is speaking of **the kingdom of God** as if it were a physical place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are almost in the kingdom of God” or “You almost belong to the kingdom of God”
12:34	b144		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μακρὰν & ἀπὸ	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **far**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “very close to”
12:34	rgh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδεὶς οὐκέτι ἐτόλμα	1	The words translated **no one** and **any longer** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “people no longer were daring”
12:35	ifdj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “After that,” or “Sometime later,”
12:35	ikub		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς	1	Here, the word **answering** indicates that Jesus asked this question in response to how the Jewish leaders had been trying to trick and trap him with their questions. Jesus was not directly responding to anyone’s question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “in response to how the Jewish leaders had been testing him” or “after the Jewish leaders had tested him”
12:35	ptc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἱερῷ	1	Here Mark means that Jesus was teaching in the **temple** area. He does not mean that Jesus was in the most sacred parts of the temple building. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. See you translated this word in [11:11](../11/11.md). Alternate translation: “temple courtyard”
12:35	q6e4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς λέγουσιν οἱ γραμματεῖς ὅτι ὁ Χριστὸς, υἱὸς Δαυείδ ἐστιν?	1	This is not a rhetorical question. Rather, Jesus’ listeners had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement.
12:35	i6a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	Here, the word **son** refers to a male descendant. It does not mean that **the Christ** is the direct son of David. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “descended from David” or “in the lineage of David”
12:36	e1zq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	Jesus uses the word **himself** here to emphasize that it was **David**, the very person whom the scribes call the father of the Christ, who wrote the words in the quotation that follows. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom they call the father of the Christ”
12:36	ejy2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ	1	Here, the phrase **in the Holy Spirit** indicates that David wrote the words that follow as **the Holy Spirit** inspired him. In other words, the **Holy Spirit** prompted David to write this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “by the inspiration of the Spirit” or “prompted by the Spirit”\n
12:36	jlbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν & εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “said that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right hand until he puts his enemies under his feet”
12:36	xdd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	εἶπεν	1	Here Jesus introduces a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book of Psalms (see [Psalm 110:1](../psa/110/01.md)). This Psalm was written by David. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Jesus is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “said in the book of Psalms” or “wrote in Scriptures”
12:36	dv7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	Here, the term Lord does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance refers to God. The second instance refers to a person whom David respectfully calls “lord.” The ULT and UST capitalize this second instance of the word because it refers to the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “God, the Lord, said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord”
12:36	v53p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	When someone sits at God’s **right hand**, it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Sit to rule at my right hand” or “Take the place of honor and authority at my right hand”
12:36	k2j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	Here, the phrase **at my right hand** refers to the place next to a person’s **right hand**, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that the Lord has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at my right side” or “at the honorable place next to me”
12:36	rfy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	In the author’s culture, to **put** people under a person’s **feet** indicates that those people have been conquered and are powerless and shamed. So, this means that God will conquer and shame all the enemies of the **Lord**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain what this action means. Alternate translation: “until I make your enemies kneel before you” or “until I conquer and shame your enemies”
12:36	tt1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **under your feet**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “as a footstool of your feet.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
12:37	qpdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον, καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν?	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would not call any of their descendants **Lord**, since this title was used for people who were more important or older. Jesus’ question assumes this practice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit. Alternate translation: “David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ and no one calls his own son ‘Lord.’ So, how can he be his son”
12:37	j7wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David himself calls the Messiah his Lord”
12:37	ssq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	See how you translated the phrase **David himself** in [12:36](../12/36.md), where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom they call the father of the Christ,”
12:37	rh2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	Like the question in [12:35](../12/35.md), this is a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones the Jewish leaders asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “so in what way can he be his son”
12:37	qucc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Here, the word **and** introduces a question that is based on the previous statement. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or conclusion. Alternate translation: “so”
12:37	tjp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱός αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the word **son** refers to a male descendant. It does not mean that the Christ is the direct son of David. See how you expressed the idea in [12:35](../12/35.md). Alternate translation: “descended from him” or “in his lineage”
12:38	bh8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	Mark uses the word **And** to indicate that Jesus is still in the temple area talking to the people there, as he was in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes that more explicit. Alternate translation: “Then” or “At that time”
12:38	yhfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βλέπετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων	1	Here Jesus means that people need to **Watch out** that they do not act like **the scribes**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Be careful that you are not like the scribes” or “Watch out that you do not behave like the scribes do”
12:38	s30c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	1	Because Jesus is teaching many people, the command **Watch out** is plural.
12:38	nxy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐν στολαῖς περιπατεῖν	1	In this culture, **long robes** were a symbol of wealth and status. To walk around in public in **long robes** was to assert one’s right to high status. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain what it means to behave in this way. Alternate translation: “to walk around looking important in their long robes”
12:38	mu5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀσπασμοὺς	1	The implication is that these would be respectful **greetings** in which the scribes would be addressed by important titles. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “respectful greetings”
12:38	akkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ταῖς ἀγοραῖς	1	The word **marketplaces** refers to large, open-air areas where people buy and sell goods. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of area, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the town squares” or “the parks”
12:39	mwmf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρωτοκαθεδρίας & πρωτοκλισίας	1	Here Jesus speaks of the **seats** and **places** for the most important people as if they were **first** in a sequence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “important seats … important places”
12:39	x6ct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	πρωτοκαθεδρίας & πρωτοκλισίας	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use cardinal numbers here or equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “the number one seats … the number one places”
12:40	j27b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if the scribes were **devouring** or eating **the houses of widows**. He means that they are taking **the houses** away from **the widows**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the ones taking the houses of widows” or “the ones defrauding widows of their houses”
12:40	jtw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus speaks of **the houses of widows** to mean their wealth and possessions, which they would have in their **houses**. If it would be helpful in your language, you state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everything that widows own”
12:40	r3ht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προφάσει	1	Here, the phrase **as a pretext** could mean: (1) that the scribes and Pharisees are using **long prayers** to try to look godly. Alternate translation: “in order to seem godly” (2) that the scribes are Pharisees are using their **long prayers** to hide or cover up how they devour the houses of widows. Alternate translation: “to cover that up” or “to disguise what they do”
12:40	d0ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **condemnation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “will be condemned more severely”
12:40	h36x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περισσότερον κρίμα	1	Here Jesus implies that these scribes will receive **greater condemnation** than they would have if they had not pretended to be godly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “greater condemnation than people who did not pretend to be godly”
12:40	qm52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	κρίμα	1	Jesus is using the word **condemnation** to mean the punishment that a person would receive after being condemned for doing something wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “punishment”
12:41	r69x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then,” or “After that,”
12:41	cx75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατέναντι τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου	1	Here, a place **opposite the treasury** is directly in front of **the treasury**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with the treasury in front of him” or “with the treasury before him”
12:41	p2kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου & τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	A **treasury** is a box or receptacle in which people can put and store money. More specifically, this word refers to the receptacles in the temple courtyard into which people could drop money that would be used to keep the temple operating. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of receptacle, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the temple money box … the temple money box” or “the chest for the gifts for the temple … the chest for the gifts for the temple”
12:41	jgkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πλούσιοι	1	Mark is using the adjective **rich** as a noun to mean rich people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “rich people”
12:41	rl1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλά	1	Mark is using the adjective **much** as a noun to mean much money. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “much money”
12:42	zl5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐλθοῦσα μία χήρα πτωχὴ ἔβαλεν	1	Here Mark introduces **one poor widow** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “a woman arrived. She was a widow, and she was poor. She put in”
12:42	b3ol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθοῦσα	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “gone” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “having gone”
12:42	g6ry		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	λεπτὰ δύο	1	The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value”
12:42	n29e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	A **quadrans** was one of the smallest and least valuable coins in circulation in this place and time. It was equivalent to about an eighth of an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of one of the least valuable coins in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “which is a nickel” or “which is not even an hour’s wage”
12:43-44	ipl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅτι ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ, πλεῖον πάντων ἔβαλεν τῶν βαλλόντων εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον & πάντες γὰρ ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον, αὕτη δὲ, ἐκ τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς, πάντα ὅσα εἶχεν ἔβαλεν, ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [12:43](../12/43.md) and [12:44](../12/44.md) into a verse bridge in order to include the reason for Jesus’ declaration before including his declaration. Alternate translation: “All put in from the things abounding to them, but this poor widow, from her poverty, put in everything, as much as she had, her whole life. Therefore, truly I say to you that she put in more than all the ones putting into the treasury”
12:43	ehlb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1	Because Jesus is speaking to his disciples, the word **you** here is singular.
12:43	ih0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ, πλεῖον πάντων ἔβαλεν	1	Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put **more** money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not express them as if they were figurative.\n
12:43	n8z5			πάντων & τῶν βαλλόντων	1	Alternate translation: “everyone else who put money”
12:43	n7su		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	See how you translated **treasury** in [12:41](../12/41.md). Alternate translation: “the temple money box” or “the chest for the gifts for the temple”
12:44	c7jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces the basis or reason for the claim that Jesus made in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a claim, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “I say that because” or “Here is why:”
12:44	n9ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντες	1	Jesus is using the adjective **all** as a noun to mean all the people who were putting money into the treasury. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “all these people” or “all those who have given money”
12:44	ihuq			ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον	1	Alternate translation: “put in only some of the many things that they had”
12:44	ui9a			αὕτη & ἐκ τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς, πάντα ὅσα εἶχεν ἔβαλεν	1	Alternate translation: “she put in all of the few things that she had”
12:44	qnzq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ τῆς ὑστερήσεως αὐτῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **poverty**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “although she was poor”
12:44	l4tp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	πάντα ὅσα εἶχεν	1	The expression **everything, as much as she had** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages. If this is true of your language, you could shorten the expression. Alternate translation: “everything that she had”\n
12:44	p3as		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	Here Jesus speaks as if the woman had put in **her whole life**. He means that she put in all the money that she had to buy what she needed to live. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all she had to live on” or “so that she had nothing left to buy even the necessities”
12:44	qrz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὅλον τὸν βίον αὐτῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “all that kept her alive”
13:intro	ti7d				0	# Mark 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Jesus in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)\n      * The disciples ask Jesus about the destruction of the temple (13:1–4)\n      * Jesus teaches about the destruction of the temple (24:5–31)\n        * Things that will happen in the time before the destruction of the temple (13:5–13)\n        * Things that will happen immediately before the destruction of the temple (13:14–23)\n        * The coming of the Son of Man (13:24–27)\n        * When these things will happen (13:28–31)\n      * Jesus teaches about his second coming (13:32–37)\n\n### When Jesus speaks about which topics\n\nWhen the disciples speak to Jesus in [13:4](../13/04.md), they ask about two things: first, they want to know when the temple will be destroyed, and second, they want to know what the sign will be that shows that the temple is about to be destroyed. Most Christians agree that Jesus answered these two questions but also included information about his second coming. However, Christians disagree about when Jesus is speaking about which topic. He could:\n\n1. finish speaking about the destruction of the temple in [13:31](../13/31.md) and then go on to speak about his second coming (the outline above follows this view)\n2. finish speaking about the destruction of the temple (perhaps as a foreshadowing of the final tribulation) in [13:23](../13/23.md) and then go on to speak about his second coming\n3. speak about the destruction of the temple (perhaps as a foreshadowing of the final tribulation) in [13:5–23](../13/05.md) and [13:28–31](../13/28.md) and about his second coming in [13:24–27](../13/24.md) and [13:32–37](../13/32.md)\n\nSince Christians disagree over when Jesus is speaking about which topic, if possible format your translation so that several interpretations are possible.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The destruction of the temple\n\nThe temple in Jerusalem was a very impressive, large building. Despite that, Jesus predicted that it would be destroyed within the lifetime of those who heard him. In fact, about 40 years later, a Roman army conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple.\n\n### The Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\n\nIn [13:26](../13/26.md), Jesus indicates that he, the Son of Man, will “come” in clouds. However, he does not indicate the location to which he will “come.” Christians debate whether Jesus is describing his return to earth or his enthronement in heaven. If possible, your translation should allow for both possibilities. See the notes on this verse for translation options.\n\n### “This generation” in [13:30](../13/30.md)\n\nIn [13:30](../13/30.md), Jesus says that what he has described will happen before “this generation” passes away. Many interpretations have been proposed for the group of people to which “this generation” refers:\n\n1. The people who were alive while Jesus was speaking these words\n2. The people who would be alive when the signs of the end began\n3. Christians throughout history\n4. Jewish people in general throughout history\n5. Humans in general\n\nSince the word that Jesus uses primarily refers to people who are alive at the same time, if possible use a word or phrase that refers to such a group of people. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include some interpretations of the word in a footnote.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is teaching four of his disciples. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verse 13. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])
13:1	cb77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	αὐτοῦ	1	Mark is referring to Jesus to represent both Jesus and his disciples, who traveled with Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he, along with his disciples,”
13:1	ltyd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐκπορευομένου	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “coming” instead of **going**. Alternate translation: “coming out”
13:1	rrv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἱεροῦ	1	Here Mark means that Jesus left the **temple** area. He does not mean that Jesus was in the most sacred parts of the temple building. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. See you translated this word in [11:11](../11/11.md). Alternate translation: “temple courtyard”\n
13:1	rmlx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	1	Here, the word **look** is meant to draw the attention of Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express behold with a word or phrase that asks a person to look or to pay attention. Alternate translation: “see” or “look at that”
13:1	hnpt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ποταποὶ λίθοι καὶ ποταπαὶ οἰκοδομαί!	1	This is an exclamation that is emphasizing that the **stones** and **buildings** are large and impressive. Use an exclamation that would communicate that meaning in your language. Alternate translation: “What impressive stones! What impressive buildings!” or “How impressive these stones and buildings are!”
13:1	ql81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποταποὶ λίθοι	1	Here, **stones** refers to the very large stones with which the temple walls were built. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “What manner of stones in the walls” or “What manner of building stones”
13:2	rez6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτας τὰς μεγάλας οἰκοδομάς?	1	Jesus is using the question form to draw the attention of the disciples to the **buildings**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Consider these great buildings.” or “See these great buildings!”
13:2	aza6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπεις	1	Because Jesus is speaking to one of his disciples, the word **you** here is singular.
13:2	ov2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον, ὃς οὐ μὴ καταλυθῇ	1	Jesus says that every **stone** will be **torn down** as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Almost every stone upon a stone will not be left here, and almost none of them will not be torn down”
13:2	xdhj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον, ὃς οὐ μὴ καταλυθῇ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who will do the action, it is clear from the context that it will be invading enemies. Alternate translation: “An invading army will certainly not leave a stone upon a stone here, which they will not tear down”
13:2	jo8i			οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον, ὃς οὐ μὴ καταλυθῇ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas in positive form. Alternate translation: “Every stone will be toppled off the stone it is on, and each one will be torn down”
13:2	xqsn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	-1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means … by no means”
13:3	izt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	αὐτοῦ	1	Mark is referring to Jesus to represent both Jesus and his disciples, who traveled with Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he, along with his disciples,”
13:3	u7ju		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατέναντι τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	Here, a place **opposite the temple** is directly in front of the temple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with the temple in front of him” or “with the temple before him”
13:4	pqa9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	εἰπὸν	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “We ask that you tell”
13:4	ekxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	εἰπὸν	1	Because the four disciples are speaking with Jesus, the command **Tell** is singular.
13:4	uf37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase these things refers to the events that Jesus described in [13:2](../13/02.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the events you have spoken about” or “that destruction”\n
13:4	ibsl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μέλλῃ ταῦτα συντελεῖσθαι πάντα	1	Here, the phrase **all these things** could refer to: (1) the events that Jesus described in [13:2](../13/02.md). Alternate translation: “all the events you have spoken about are about to be completed” (2) the end of the age, or the time when Jesus returns. Alternate translation: “this age is about to be completed” or “all things are about to end”
13:4	lw1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μέλλῃ & συντελεῖσθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “are about to take place” or “are about to occur”
13:5	fe42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next thing that happened. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then”
13:5	qekc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμᾶς πλανήσῃ	1	Jesus is speaking as if the disciples could literally be led **astray**, that is, led down the wrong path. He means that they could be deceived. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causes you to believe what is wrong”
13:6	pbz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὶ & πολλοὺς	1	In both places, Jesus is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Many men and women … many men and women”
13:6	sxl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλεύσονται	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “will go”
13:6	z63u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here, the word **name** refers primarily to the person who has that name, and it focuses especially on that person’s authority. More specifically, Jesus could mean that: (1) these people claim to have the authority that Jesus properly has. Alternate translation: “in my authority” or “claiming to have the authority I have” (2) these people claim to represent Jesus. Alternate translation: “claiming to be my representatives” or “as if they were my representatives”
13:6	cee7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγοντες, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι, καὶ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “saying that they are him, and”
13:6	wv12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγώ εἰμι	1	The implication is that these people are claiming to be the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I am the Christ”
13:6	h7fs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πολλοὺς πλανήσουσιν	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:5](../13/05.md). Alternate translation: “they will cause many to believe what is wrong”
13:7	fl5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πολέμους καὶ ἀκοὰς πολέμων	1	The phrase **wars and rumors of wars** could mean: (1) reports of wars that are currently happening and reports of wars that might happen in the future. Alternate translation: “of wars that are happening and rumors about wars that might happen” (2) reports of wars that are already taking place nearby and reports of wars that are happening in distant places. Alternate translation: “reports of wars that are close by and of wars that are far away”
13:7	eujo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ θροεῖσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was the **wars** and **rumors of wars**. Alternate translation: “do not let those things trouble you”
13:7	xp8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δεῖ γενέσθαι	1	Here Jesus means that God has planned these things, and they will not change. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “God has chosen that these things will happen”
13:7	d1k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὔπω τὸ τέλος	1	Here Jesus could be speaking about: (1) the **end** of the temple, which Jesus had predicted in [13:2](../13/02.md). Alternate translation: “the end of the temple is not yet” or “what I have predicted will not yet happen” (2) the **end** of the age, which he will say more about later in his teaching. Alternate translation: “the end of the world is not yet” or “it is not yet the moment in the future when the current way of doing things will cease”
13:8	a4rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what is going to happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Even more,”
13:8	ydrb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two phrases. Alternate translation: “nation will rise against nation, yes, kingdom against kingdom” or “nation and kingdom rise against nation and kingdom”
13:8	rlxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	The words **nation** and **kingdom** represents nations and kingdoms in general, not one particular kingdom and nation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “some nations will rise against other nations, and some kingdoms against other kingdoms”
13:8	oyrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐγερθήσεται & ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	Here, the words **nation** and **kingdom** represent the people who live in them.

Alternate translation: “the people of a nation will rise up against the people of another nation, and the people of a kingdom against the people of another kingdom”\n
13:8	xln4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγερθήσεται & ἐπ’	1	The phrase **rise against** referring to attacking someone or something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will fight against”
13:8	e2ln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “kingdom will rise against kingdom”
13:8	npua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	λιμοί	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **famines**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “famines and troubles.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
13:8	pcyi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	Here, **These things** refers to the things that Jesus has said will happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “The things that I have just described are”
13:8	dz8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων	1	Here Jesus speaks of the events that he has described as if they were **the beginning of birth pains**. He means that, just like birth pains, they are difficult and painful things that eventually lead to a happy and wonderful result. If possible, you should maintain the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “like the beginning of birth pains”
13:9	c2cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ ὑμεῖς	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that Jesus will speak about, which is **you**, the disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new topic, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “As for you”
13:9	nuti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βλέπετε & ἑαυτούς	1	Jesus uses a word for seeing to indicate the need for paying attention or being ready. He means that they need to make sure that they are ready for what is going to happen to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “prepare yourselves” or “pay attention to yourselves”

As in [13:7](../13/07.md), here Jesus could be referring to: (1) the end of the temple, which Jesus had predicted in [13:2](../13/02.md). Alternate translation: “before the end of the temple” or “before what I have predicted about the temple happens” (2) the end of the age, which he will say more about later in his teaching.

If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that believers will be the ones who proclaim the gospel. Alternate translation: “believers to proclaim the gospel” or “people to proclaim the gospel”
13:11	k924		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἄγωσιν ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to any person who leads the disciples away.

13:11	p9pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ὃ ἐὰν δοθῇ ὑμῖν ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ, τοῦτο λαλεῖτε	1	Here, the word **that** refers directly back to **whatever is given to you in that hour**. Jesus expresses the idea in this way to introduce **whatever is given to you** and then explain what they should do with it. If stating the topic and then referring back to it with the word **that** would be redundant in your language, you could omit the redundant information. Alternate translation: “speak whatever is given to you in that hour”
13:11	m0xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δοθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:12	hrhw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πατὴρ τέκνον	1	Although the term **father** is masculine, Jesus is probably using the word here in a generic sense that includes both fathers and mothers.

13:12	r66s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1	Here Jesus implies that the **children** will have someone else put their parents to death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “have them put to death”
13:13	pk3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἔσεσθε μισούμενοι ὑπὸ πάντων	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “all will hate you”
13:13	paf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντων	1	Jesus is using the adjective **all** as a noun to mean all people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “all people” or “everyone”
13:13	w8pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντων	1	Jesus says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “most people”

Jesus expresses the idea in this way to introduce people who endure **to the end** and then explain what happens to them.

Alternate translation: “the one having endured to the end will be saved”
13:13	c33n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ & ὑπομείνας	1	Jesus is speaking of anyone who endures, not of one particular person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “anyone who endures”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the shameful thing that defiles the temple”
13:14	v73e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe an **abomination** that causes **desolation**.

13:14	ev0a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **abomination** and **desolation**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “the abominable thing that desolates”
13:14	hefe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἑστηκότα ὅπου οὐ δεῖ	1	Here, the word translated **standing** is masculine, which is why the ULT uses the word **he** in this sentence. By using this form, Mark could be indicating that: (1) **the abomination** is a thing that is identified with a man. In this case, it could be a statue of a man or something that a man sets up or creates. You could express the idea by referring to **the abomination** with the pronoun **it**. Alternate translation: “standing it should not be” (2) **the abomination** is a man who can also be described as an **abomination**. You could express the idea by referring to **the abomination** with the pronoun **he** or by using some other form that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “standing where that man of abomination should not be”
13:14	vx3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅπου οὐ δεῖ	1	Jesus’ audience would have known that the phrase **where he should not be** implicitly refers to the temple.

Use a form that clearly indicates that Mark is writing this, not reporting what Jesus spoke. Alternate translation: “he should not be” (and I, Mark, add: let the one who reads this story understand), “then” (2) spoken by Jesus to anyone who reads what Daniel wrote about **the abomination of desolation**. Alternate translation: “he should not be—let the one who has read the book of Daniel understand—then”
13:14	sq7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω	1	Here, the phrase **let the one reading understand** could indicate that **the one reading**: (1) should be able to **understand** what **the abomination of desolation** is. In this case, Mark could be implying that **the one reading** needs to read the passages in the book of Daniel where this **abomination** is mentioned. Alternate translation: “you know what I mean” or “the one reading should understand from the book of Daniel” (2) should try to **understand** what **the abomination of desolation** is. Alternate translation: “let the one reading try to understand” or “reader, pay attention”
13:14	buns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one reading must understand”

People would eat and do other activities on top of their houses. Jesus assumes that his hearers know this and that they know that the roofs were accessed by an exterior staircase at the back of the house, distant from the entry at the front. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “let the one who is on top of his roof escape immediately by the back stairway and not descend in order to go into his house to take anything”
13:15	of80		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ & ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω, μηδὲ εἰσελθάτω	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two terms connected with **nor**. The phrase **go down** tells how the person is able to **go in**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **nor**. Alternate translation: “let the one on the housetop not go down to enter in order” or “let the one on the housetop not, after going down, go in”
13:15	zfta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ὁ & ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω, μηδὲ εἰσελθάτω	1	If your language does not use third-person imperatives in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one on the housetop must not go down nor go in”
13:15	xetk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ὁ & ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω, μηδὲ εἰσελθάτω	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **go**. Alternate translation: “let the one on the housetop not come down nor come in”

13:16	n44r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν, μὴ ἐπιστρεψάτω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, ἆραι τὸ ἱμάτιον αὐτοῦ	1	People in Jesus’ time often walked from their towns to the **field** that they worked in during the day. Jesus is saying that, when they see the abomination of desolation, they should not return to their town to get their cloaks. Instead, they should flee directly from the field that they are working in. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “let the one working the field not return to his town or house to get his cloak”
13:16	wcdd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ὁ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν, μὴ ἐπιστρεψάτω	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one in the field must not turn back”

Alternate translation: “But there will be in those days tribulation—such as this kind has not happened from the beginning of creation which God created until now and will certainly not happen. Therefore, pray that it might not happen in winter”

13:19	ltzv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the disciples should pray that they these things would not happen in winter.

13:19	fqx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”
13:20	ocw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ μὴ ἐκολόβωσεν Κύριος τὰς ἡμέρας, οὐκ ἂν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ	1	Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that the Lord really has shortened **the days**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “were the Lord not to shorten the days, no flesh would be saved” or “imagine that the Lord did not shorten the days. Then, no flesh would be saved”
13:20	aggr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	μὴ ἐκολόβωσεν Κύριος τὰς ἡμέρας, οὐκ ἂν ἐσώθη πᾶσα σάρξ	1	Jesus is using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future. He is doing this because he knows that God has already decided to **shorten the days**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense, or you could refer to God’s decision. Alternate translation: “the Lord were not going to shorten the days, no flesh would be saved” or “the Lord had not already made the decision to shorten those days, no flesh would have been saved”
13:20	el7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰς ἡμέρας & τὰς ἡμέρας	1	Here, the phrase **the days** refers to the time period that Jesus has been describing.

13:20	af7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἐκλεκτοὺς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **elect** as a noun to mean elect people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the elect people”

Alternate translation: “And then false Christs and false prophets will be raised up and will give signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. So, if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ! Behold, there!’ do not believe it.”
13:21	xpd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	τότε ἐάν τις ὑμῖν εἴπῃ	1	Jesus speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it will happen.

Alternate translation: “Then, although some people will say to you”
13:21	qsfu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὑμῖν εἴπῃ, ἴδε, ὧδε ὁ Χριστός, ἴδε, ἐκεῖ, μὴ πιστεύετε	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “says to you that you should look because the Christ is here or that you should look because he is there, do not not believe it”
13:21	ynm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἴδε, ὧδε ὁ Χριστός, ἴδε, ἐκεῖ	1	Here Jesus is implying that these two statements are two examples of what people might say to the disciples. Jesus is not implying that the same person says these two sentences during the same conversation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that makes that idea moreexplicit. Alternate translation: “‘Behold, here is the Christ!’ or if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, there!’”
13:21	pctq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	-1	In both places, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to look at something.

13:21	yfd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἴδε, ἐκεῖ	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

13:22	x8d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a basis for the command that Jesus gave in the previous verse.

If you need to say who will do the action, it is clear from the context that it will be the false Christs and false prophets themselves. Alternate translation: “will rise up”
13:22	n39a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγερθήσονται	1	Here, the phrase **will be raised up** refers to people beginning to do some task publicly.

13:22	w3mf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα	1	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Jesus is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “amazing signs” or “impressive deeds”
13:22	vh4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸς τὸ ἀποπλανᾶν εἰ δυνατὸν τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς	1	Jesus is speaking as if the false Christs and prophets could literally **lead** people **astray**.

13:22	n81i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **elect** as a noun to mean elect people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

13:23	z378		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὑμεῖς δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that Jesus will speak about, which is **you**, the disciples.

The word **after** does not indicate how long it will be between the **tribulation** and the events that Jesus describes in [13:24–27](../013/24.md).

13:34	xp0s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	τῷ θυρωρῷ & ἵνα γρηγορῇ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “the doorkeeper, ‘Stay alert;’”
13:34	cuz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ θυρωρῷ	1	A **doorkeeper** is a person who guards an entrance into a building and makes sure that only certain people can enter. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of guard, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the servant who guarded the door”
13:34	g7j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γρηγορῇ	1	Here Jesus implies that the man who owned the house **commanded the doorkeeper** to **stay alert** in general but especially to be ready for when he returned and wanted to enter into his house.

13:35	s8j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀλεκτοροφωνίας	1	A **rooster** is a large bird, a male chicken, which often calls out with a loud sound around the time the sun comes up.

13:35	v6it		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀλεκτοροφωνίας	1	In Jesus’ culture, people referred to the period of the night soon before the sun rose as the time of **rooster crowing**.

14:intro	uk36				0	# Mark 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Jesus’ last days and death (14:1–15:47)\n      * The chief priests and scribes plan to kill Jesus (14:1–2)\n      * A woman anoints Jesus (14:3–9)\n      * Judas agrees to hand Jesus over (14:10–11)\n      * Jesus’ last meal with his disciples (14:12–25)\n      * Jesus predicts that his disciples will deny him (14:26–31)\n      * Jesus prays in Gethsemane (14:32–42)\n      * Judas hands Jesus over, and the disciples flee (26:43–52)\n      * Jesus’ trial before the Jewish council (14:53–65)\n      * Peter denies Jesus three times (14:66–72)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [14:27](../14/27.md), which is a quote from [Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Perfumed oil\n\nIn [14:3–9](../14/03.md), a woman anoints Jesus with perfumed oil. The kind that the woman uses was very expensive. People would use these oils to make themselves look and smell good. Also, they used oils to anoint corpses before they buried them, possibly to keep them from smelling. In this story, the woman uses the oil to honor Jesus, and Jesus also interprets it as a preparation for his burial. Make sure that your readers understand what anointing with this kind of oil means. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/oil]])\n\n### Denying Jesus\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus and his disciples speak about “denying” Jesus. If a disciple denies Jesus, the disciple claims to have no connection with Jesus, neither knowing nor following him. Consider how you might naturally express this idea in your language.\n\n### Jesus’ trial before the Jewish council\n\nIn [14:53–65](../14/53.md), Mark narrates Jesus’ trial before the Jewish council. Since Jerusalem was governed by the Roman empire, the Roman governor, Pilate, was the only one who could actually have someone executed. So, the Jewish council needed to find evidence against Jesus that proved that he did something for which the Roman governor would execute him. This trial, then, was a preliminary step. They first needed to find good evidence to condemn Jesus, and then they needed to present evidence to the Roman governor that would lead to him executing Jesus. While you should not explain all these details in your translation, make sure that your translation does fit with this general idea.\n\n### The Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\n\nIn [14:62](../14/62.md), Jesus indicates that he, the Son of Man, will “come” on the clouds of heaven. However, he does not indicate the location to which he will “come.” Christians debate whether Jesus is describing his return to earth or his enthronement in heaven. If possible, your translation should allow for both possibilities. See the notes on this verse for translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Body and bread, blood and cup\n\nIn [14:22–25](../14/22.md), Jesus identifies bread as “my body” and wine in a cup as “my blood of the covenant.” These statements can be understood in at least three primary ways: (1) the bread and wine somehow become Jesus’ body and blood; (2) Jesus’ body and blood are present, physically or spiritually, in the bread and wine; or (3) the bread and wine memorialize or symbolize Jesus’ body and blood. Christians are divided on this question, and statements that link body and blood to bread and wine are very significant in the Bible and in Christian teaching. For these reasons, it is best to preserve these statements without expressing them as similes or in another nonfigurative way. If you must express them in another way, see the notes on [14:22–25](../14/22.md) for translation possibilities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is talking to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 12, 13, 17, 27, 30, 32, 33, 34, 37, 41, 43, 45, 51, 53, 61, 63, 66, 67. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### Abba, Father\n\nIn [14:36](../14/36.md), Mark indicates that Jesus says “Abba, Father” when he prays. “Abba” is an Aramaic word that the Jews used to speak to their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds. The word that follows, which is the word for “father” in Greek, could be Mark’s explanation of what “Abba” means. On the other hand, Jesus might have used this Greek word in his prayer. If possible, spell out “Abba” as it sounds in your language and then use the word you use to translate “Father” when it refers to God. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Judas’ kiss for Jesus\n\nIn [14:44–45](../14/44.md), Mark describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. In this culture, when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them, probably on one cheek or on both cheeks. If men would not greet each other with a kiss in your culture, you could explain the purpose of the kiss, or you could translate the expression in a more general way. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/kiss]])\n
14:1	hwb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Mark uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “Meanwhile,”
14:1	xa8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ Πάσχα καὶ τὰ Ἄζυμα	1	Here Mark’s readers would have known that **the Passover** was a festival that took place on the first day of the week-long celebration named **the Festival of Unleavened Bread**, so Mark speaks of the two as one event.

Alternate translation: “the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Passover,” or “the Passover, the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread,”
14:1	ve8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δόλῳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **deceit**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “deceitfully” or “cleverly”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Also, you could express the idea as a request rather than as a question. Alternate translation: “Will you allow me to use my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” or “Please allow me to use my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples.”
14:14	yhtm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ κατάλυμά μου	1	Here, Jesus is instructing the disciples to use the possessive form to describe a **guest room** that has been reserved for Jesus.

14:15	jlci		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνάγαιον μέγα	1	In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built above other rooms.

14:15	x3zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐστρωμένον ἕτοιμον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

14:15	ujqy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐστρωμένον ἕτοιμον	1	The terms **furnished** and **ready** mean similar things. Jesus is using the two terms together for emphasis.

14:15	k4t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	Here, when Jesus says **us**, he is referring to himself and his disciples, including the two he is addressing here, so **us** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms.

14:18	cwl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνακειμένων	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would usually recline, or lay on one side, when they were eating. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the position in which people eat in your culture. Since Mark clarifies that they are **eating**, you do not need to explain the meaning of the action. See how you expressed the similar phrase in [14:3](../14/03.md). Alternate translation: “sitting down”\n
14:18	dg95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ ἐσθίων μετ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Here Jesus further describes the **one** who will hand him over as someone who is **eating with** him.

14:19	cy1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	μήτι ἐγώ	1	The disciples are leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “Surely it is not I who will hand you over”
14:20	a0c1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces what Jesus said in contrast to what the disciples were asking.

14:21	h35q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ὑπάγει	1	Here Jesus uses the present tense to describe a future event. He does this to emphasize that the future event is sure to happen.

14:22	oqv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐλογήσας	1	Here Mark could be implying that Jesus **blessed**: (1) God for providing the food.

14:22	ula2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔκλασεν	1	Here Matthew means that Jesus broke the bread in pieces so that it could be served to the disciples. This was a normal practice in his culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he divided the bread into servings” or “he broke the bread into smaller pieces”
14:22	ukuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	λάβετε	1	Here Jesus implies that he wants the disciples to **Take** the pieces of bread that he gave to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Take these pieces of bread”
14:22	qqcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λάβετε	1	Here Jesus implies that the disciples should eat the pieces of bread after they **Take** them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Take and eat”
14:22	adb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου	1	Here Jesus identifies the bread as his **body**. This figure of speech has been interpreted in a number of ways. The bread could somehow become Jesus’ **body**, or Jesus’ **body** could be present in some way when people eat the bread, or the bread could represent or memorialize Jesus’ **body**. Because of the variety of interpretations and the significance of this metaphor, you should preserve the metaphor if there is any way to do so. If you must express the metaphor in a different way, use a form that could fit with as many of the listed interpretations as possible. Alternate translation: “This functions as my body”
14:23	u6rc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ποτήριον	1	Here Mark uses the word **cup** to refer both to it and to the drink inside the cup, which in Jesus’ culture would have been wine.

14:24	hs24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης	1	Here Jesus identifies the cup of wine as his **blood of the covenant**. This figure of speech has been interpreted in a number of ways. The wine could somehow become Jesus’ **blood**, or Jesus’ **blood** could be present in some way when people drink the wine, or the wine could represent or memorialize Jesus’ **blood**. Because of the variety of interpretations and the significance of this metaphor, you should preserve the metaphor if there is any way to do so. If you must express the metaphor in a different way, use a form that could fit with as many of the listed interpretations as possible. Alternate translation: “This functions as my blood of the covenant”
14:24	cdol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτό	1	Here, the pronoun **This** refers to the wine in the cup that Mark mentioned in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the wine more directly. Alternate translation: “The wine in this cup”
14:24	nj85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης	1	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe how his **blood** inaugurates or initiates **the covenant**.

14:24	m329		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῆς διαθήκης	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **of the covenant**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “of the new covenant.” The word “new” may have been accidentally added here because it appears in the parallel story in Luke (see [Luke 22:20](../luk/22/20.md)). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
14:24	q5hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον	1	Here Jesus means that he will die and his blood will be **poured out** of his body. He is using words that people would use to describe how animals would be offered to God: these animals would be killed and then their blood would be **poured out** on or near the altar. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “which, when I die, is being poured out” or “which is being shed”
14:24	pt5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκχυννόμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, Jesus implies that he himself does it when he dies. Alternate translation: “I am pouring out”
14:24	p5vr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “many men and women”
14:25	mxwn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ πίω	1	The words translated **certainly not any longer** are three negative words. In this construction, the second and third negatives do not cancel the first. Instead, they give greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use three negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a triple negative here. If your language does not use three negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “I will by no means any longer drink” or “I will certainly no longer drink”
14:25	t7ai		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου	1	Here, the phrase **fruit of the vine** refers to wine. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “alcohol made from grapes” or “wine”

14:25	y1pf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτὸ πίνω καινὸν	1	Here, the word **new** could go with: (1) **drink**. In this case, Jesus means that he will drink the wine in a **new** way.

14:26	b994		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then,”
14:26	l996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑμνήσαντες	1	A **hymn** is a song or poem that is sung to praise God. The Jews would traditionally sing a psalm from Psalms 113–118 at the end of the Passover meal, so the **hymn** that Jesus and his disciples sang was likely one of these psalms. If your readers would not be familiar with a **hymn**, you could use the name for religious songs in your culture, if you have them, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “having sung a psalm” or “having sung a song of praise to God”
14:27	pu4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε, ὅτι γέγραπται, πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the last clauses gives the basis for the claim that the first clause makes. Alternate translation: “It is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.’ Therefore, you all will be caused to stumble”
14:27	lty4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε	1	Here Jesus speaks as if his disciples were going to **stumble**. He means that they will reject and desert him because of what will happen to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You all will desert me” or “You all will run away from me”
14:27	zaxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You all will stumble”
14:27	gkb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1	Here, Jesus uses the phrase **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament passage of Scripture, ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Jesus is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “you can read in the Scriptures” or “it says in the book of Zechariah”

14:29	u6sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces what Peter said in contrast to what Jesus said.

In Jesus’ culture, people usually considered sunset to be the start of the next day. So, Jesus is indicating that Peter will deny him that night, before the sun rises.

See how you translated this word in [13:35](../13/35.md). Alternate translation: “a bird sings”

14:31	w9zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μή	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative.

If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means”

14:33	o38r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐκθαμβεῖσθαι καὶ ἀδημονεῖν	1	The terms **distressed** and **greatly troubled** mean similar things. Mark is using the two terms together for emphasis.

14:34	ic1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἕως θανάτου	1	Jesus is using the phrase **to death** to describe the extent of his grief. He uses this overstatement in order to show how very **grieved** he is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses great sorrow, or you could express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “so much so that I cannot stand it much longer” or “as if I were about to die”
14:35	fq5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	προελθὼν μικρὸν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come a little father”

14:35	gj74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	παρέλθῃ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα	1	Here, when Jesus prays that he **the hour might pass from him**, he is praying that he would not experience **the hour**.

14:36	k3ci		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἀββά, ὁ Πατήρ	1	Here Mark uses an Aramaic word for Father (**Abba**) and then the normal word for **Father** in his language.

If it is necessary, you could use a form that indicates that Mark is translating the word that Jesus used. Alternate translation: “Abba—that is, Father—” (2) indicating that Jesus used both of these words in his prayer. Alternate translation: “Abba, my Father”
14:36	c11w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἀββά	1	The word **Abba** is an Aramaic word meaning **Father**. Jewish people used this word to address their fathers.

14:36	s1r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρένεγκε	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “I ask that you remove”
14:36	jk6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο	1	Jesus is referring to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a **cup** of bitter-tasting liquid that he would have to drink.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “of witnesses to prove that he is guilty”
14:64	zwf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς βλασφημίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **blasphemy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “him blaspheme” or “the blasphemous things he says”
14:64	zc7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ὑμῖν φαίνεται	1	Here the high priest is asking the rest of the Jewish council to state whether they think Jesus is guilty or innocent and what they should do with him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “What is your verdict” or “What do you think we should do”
14:64	fu4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔνοχον εἶναι θανάτου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as someone who deserved to die”
14:65	y1s4			τινες	1	Alternate translation: “some of those present” or “some of the people there”
14:65	se1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐμπτύειν αὐτῷ	1	In Jesus’ culture, people would **spit on** someone to insult that person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain what this action means. Alternate translation: “to spit on him, dishonoring him,”
14:65	d56t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	περικαλύπτειν αὐτοῦ τὸ πρόσωπον	1	To **blindfold** someone means to tie a thick cloth around the middle of a person’s head to cover the eyes and prevent that person from seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “to cover his face so that he could not see”
14:65	dg7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	προφήτευσον	1	The guards did not believe that Jesus was a real prophet and could **Prophesy**. When they demanded that Jesus should **Prophesy**, they were challenging him to do something they believed he could not do. They were only asking Jesus to **Prophesy** in order to mock him. If it would be helpful in your language, consider expressing the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Show us that you can prophesy” or “Prophesy to us if you really can”
14:65	gvq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προφήτευσον	1	Here the people telling Jesus to **Prophesy** are implying that they want him to identify who it was who had just hit him. Since he was blindfolded, this would be prophesying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Prophesy! Tell us who hit you.” or “Declare who struck you!”
14:65	svkg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	προφήτευσον	1	Because these people are speaking to Jesus, the command **Prophesy** is singular.
14:65	vwyz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οἱ ὑπηρέται	1	Here, the word **officers** refers to servants and attendants in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that generally refers to servants and any others who do what they are told. See how you translated this word in [14:54](../14/54.md). Alternate translation: “the attendants” or “those who served there”
14:65	q6qw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτὸν ἔλαβον	1	Here Mark implies that the **officers** took charge of Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “took charge of him” or “took him away”

This story continues the narrative about Peter that Mark began in [14:54](../14/54.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a simultaneous event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “During those events,” or “While that was happening,”
14:66	bqyz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κάτω ἐν τῇ αὐλῇ	1	Here Mark implies that the room where the Sanhedrin was meeting was above the ground. The room could have been raised slightly above the ground above another room. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “in the courtyard below the room where Jesus was” or “in the courtyard, which was lower than the house”
14:66	crfm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἔρχεται	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “goes” instead of **comes**. Alternate translation: “goes”
14:67	rtos		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	θερμαινόμενον	1	Here Mark implies that Peter was still **warming himself** by the fire in the courtyard of the high priest’s house (see [14:54](../14/54.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “warming himself by the fire”
14:67	eiqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ σὺ μετὰ τοῦ Ναζαρηνοῦ ἦσθα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here the servant girl means that Peter was a disciple of Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “You also were a disciple of the Nazarene, Jesus”
14:67	mzhr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σὺ	1	Because the servant girl is speaking to Peter, the word **You** is singular.
14:68	es9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & ἠρνήσατο	1	Here Mark implies that Peter **denied** that he was with Jesus as his disciple. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he denied that he was with Jesus”

14:68	y3ju		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὔτε οἶδα, οὔτε ἐπίσταμαι σὺ τί λέγεις	1	Here Peter means that servant girl’s words do not apply to him. He does not mean that he was unable to know or **understand** what the servant girl said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “You are saying things that I neither know nor understand anything about” or “I have nothing to do with what you are talking about!”
14:68	l5i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	οὔτε οἶδα, οὔτε ἐπίσταμαι σὺ τί λέγεις	1	The phrase **Neither have I known** and the phrase **nor do I understand** mean basically the same thing. Peter is using the repetition for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “I surely do not know what you are saying” or “I have no idea what you are talking about”
14:68	yxsk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σὺ	1	Because Peter is speaking to the servant girl, the word **you** is singular.
14:68	q6m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξῆλθεν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “came” instead of **went**. Alternate translation: “he came out”
14:68	r148		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ προαύλιον	1	A **forecourt** is an open area that leads into another open area (the “court”), which is more closely connected to the house. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of open area, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “the outer court” or “the open area further away from the house”
14:68	liv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τὸ προαύλιον	1	Many ancient manuscripts do not include any more words in this verse after the phrase **the forecourt**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts include the words “and a rooster crowed” after **the forecourt**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
14:69	bnzo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	τοῖς παρεστῶσιν, ὅτι οὗτος ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐστιν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “to the ones standing around that he was from them.”
14:69	xv3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐστιν	1	Here the servant girl means that Peter was one of the people who traveled with Jesus and were part of his group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is one of them” or “is a follower of Jesus”
14:69	v5kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Jesus and his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples”
14:70	jrw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν ἠρνεῖτο	1	Here Mark implies that Peter **was denying** that he was with Jesus as his disciple. See how you expressed the similar idea in [14:68](../14/68.md). Alternate translation: “was denying again that he was with Jesus”
14:70	kxvw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀληθῶς ἐξ αὐτῶν εἶ, καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖος εἶ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. Alternate translation: “You also are a Galilean, so truly you are from them”
14:70	blut		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξ αὐτῶν εἶ	1	Here the people mean that Peter was one of the people who traveled with Jesus and were part of his group.

14:70	qjgs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Jesus and his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples”
14:70	pjm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖος εἶ	1	Here the people **standing around** imply that, since Peter was **a Galilean**, he must have been with Jesus, who also was a Galilean. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “for you, like Jesus, are a Galilean” or “for Jesus is a Galilean, and you are one also”
14:71	zsq0			ὁ & ἤρξατο ἀναθεματίζειν καὶ ὀμνύειν, ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα	1	Alternate translation: “he began to say, ‘I call a curse down on myself and swear that I do not know”
14:71	ce6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναθεματίζειν	1	Here, the phrase **to curse** could mean that: (1) Peter asks God to curse him if he is lying.

14:71	vihe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ὀμνύειν, ὅτι οὐκ οἶδα τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον, ὃν λέγετε	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “to swear that he did not know the man whom they were talking about”
14:72	i7u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀλέκτωρ ἐφώνησεν	1	See how you translated **rooster** and “crow” in [13:30](../13/30.md). Alternate translation: “a bird sang”\n
14:72	ja3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ἐκ δευτέρου	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “time number two”
14:72	cfno		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ῥῆμα	1	Here, **word** represents what Jesus just said using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “statement” or “words”
14:72	xb2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἶπεν αὐτῷ & ὅτι πρὶν ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι δὶς, τρίς με ἀπαρνήσῃ; καὶ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “said to him, that before a rooster crowed twice, he would deny him three times, and”
14:72	trxc			πρὶν ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι δὶς, τρίς με ἀπαρνήσῃ	1	This clause is basically identical to what Jesus said in [14:30](../14/30.md), so express the idea as you did there.
14:72	ocer		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀπαρνήσῃ	1	Because Jesus spoke these words to Peter, the word **you** is singular.

15:intro	d823				0	# Mark 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Jesus’ last days and death (14:1–15:47)\n      * Jesus’ trial before Pilate (15:1–15)\n      * Jesus is crucified (15:16–41)\n        * The soldiers mock Jesus (15:16–20)\n        * Jesus is crucified, and people mock him (15:21–32)\n        * Jesus dies (15:33–41)\n      * Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus’ body (15:42–47)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Golgotha\n\nAs Mark indicates in [15:22](../15/22.md), “Golgotha” means “Place of a Skull.” The reason why this place was called Place of a Skull is not known. It could have been named this because the appearance of this place resembled a skull. Or, it could have been named this because it was the site of so many executions, in which case the word “Skull” is being used as metonymy to refer to death. Because the reason that this location was called Place of a Skull is unknown, you should translate this phrase in a way that allows for either meaning, as modeled by the ULT and UST.\n\n### The drinks that people offered to Jesus\n\nIn [15:23](../15/23.md), some people offer Jesus “wine having been mixed with myrrh.” In [15:36](../15/36.md), someone offers Jesus “vinegar.” In both cases, scholars debate whether people offered these drinks to help Jesus by easing the pain or quenching his thirst or whether they offered these drinks to torment Jesus by giving him a bad-tasting drink or to mock him. Since it is not obvious what the purpose of the drinks was, if possible express the idea in such a way that your readers could draw either conclusion. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include some extra information in a footnote. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### Calling Elijah\n\nIn [15:34](../15/34.md), Jesus calls out “Eloi, Eloi,” which is how Jesus said “My God, my God” in his language. Some of the people standing there misheard him and thought that he was calling out to “Elijah,” a prophet with a name that sounds like “Eloi.” There is a story about this Elijah in [2 Kings 2:11–12](../2ki/02/11.md), where God takes him into heaven. So, some people believed that Elijah did not die and would someday return. The people who thought Jesus was calling to Elijah thought that he was asking Elijah to return and rescue him. If your readers would not understand why the people standing near Jesus speak about Elijah, you could include some extra information in your translation or include this information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])\n\n### The curtain of the temple tearing from top to bottom\n\nThe “curtain” to which Mark refers in [15:38](../15/38.md) could be either the curtain that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the temple, or it could be the curtain that separated the Holy Place from the rest of the temple area. Mark indicates that this curtain tore from the top to the bottom, which means that a person did not do it. Christians debate what the tearing of this curtain might have symbolized. There are at least three major options:\n\n1. the tearing of the curtain could indicate that access to God is now available to everyone.\n2. the tearing of the curtain could indicate that God is going to destroy the temple.\n3. the tearing of the curtain could indicate that God is revealing something.\n\nSince Mark does not explain what the tearing of the curtain means, you should not explain it in your translation. However, if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include what it might mean in a footnote.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([15:46](../15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was a large hole or room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nIn this chapter, people mock Jesus several times. First, in [15:16–19](../15/16.md), the soldiers pretend like Jesus is a king. They give him a purple robe, a crown of thorns, and they pretend to greet him and honor him as a king. They do not actually believe that Jesus is a king, so they are doing these things sarcastically to make fun of Jesus. Second, in [15:29–32](../15/29.md), people walking by and the Jewish leaders tell Jesus to save himself and to come down from the cross. They do not actually believe that he can do these things, so they are speaking sarcastically to make fun of Jesus. Make sure that it is clear in your translation that these are sarcastic actions done to make fun of Jesus. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc:///ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when people are speaking to Jesus. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, and 27. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?\n\nIn [15:34](../15/34.md), Mark spells out the sounds of the words that Jesus spoke in his own language, which in this case could have been Aramaic or Hebrew. Either way, Mark translates the words later on in the verse as “My God, my God, why did you forsake me?” You can express the idea as Mark did by spelling out how the words sound and then translating their meaning in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Verse 28\n\nMany of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [15:28](../15/28.md). A few early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words: “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘And he was counted with lawless ones.’” Since a similar sentence appears in [Luke 22:37](../luk/22/37.md), it is likely that people who copied the manuscripts accidentally or intentionally added these words here in Mark. Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n
15:1	yacz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ εὐθὺς	1	Here, the phrase **And immediately** introduces the next major event in the story. Mark means that this event began soon after the event he just finished narrating. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event. Alternate translation: “Soon after that,”
15:1	pqnv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	συμβούλιον ποιήσαντες	1	Here, the phrase **having made counsel** indicates that the Jewish leaders were working together to figure something out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having made plans” or “having come up with an idea”
15:1	bhdq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὅλον τὸ Συνέδριον	1	Here Mark is referring to the rest of the **Sanhedrin**. He does not mean that the **chief priests**, **elders**, and **scribes** whom he has previously mentioned were not part of the **Sanhedrin**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “and the rest of the entire Sanhedrin” or “all the other members of the Sanhedrin”
15:1	xz7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δήσαντες τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	Here Mark implies that the Jewish council commanded guards to bind Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having commanded the guards to bind Jesus”
15:1	y550		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπήνεγκαν	1	Here Mark implies that the Jewish council **led** Jesus **away** from the high priest’s house and to the place where **Pilate** was staying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “they led him away from the high priest’s house”
15:1	v2yf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρέδωκαν Πειλάτῳ	1	Here Mark implies that the Jewish leaders brought Jesus to Pilate because they wanted Pilate to judge him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “handed him over to Pilate to be judged by him”
15:2	kn7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ λέγει	1	Together the two words **answering** and **says** mean that Jesus responded to what Pilate asked him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “But he responded to him” or “But he said to him”
15:2	dh6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σὺ λέγεις	1	Here, the phrase **You say {it}** indicates that the speaker acknowledges the truth of what the other person said. Jesus uses this phrase to indirectly indicate that Pilate is right to suggest that Jesus is **the King of the Jews**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that gives an indirect positive response to a request. If necessary, you could express the idea more directly, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “That is what you say” or “Your words show what is true”
15:3	ue18			κατηγόρουν αὐτοῦ & πολλά	1	Alternate translation: “were saying that Jesus had done many wrong things” or “were telling Pilate that Jesus had frequently done what was wrong”
15:3	bkoe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πολλά	1	Here, the word translated **of many things** could: (1) indicate that the chief priests accused Jesus of doing **many** different things. Alternate translation: “of many crimes” (2) indicate that the chief priests accused Jesus **many** times. Alternate translation: “repeatedly” or “again and again”
15:4	dliw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next thing that happened. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then”
15:4	xcz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “and he asked”
15:4	x1dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐκ ἀποκρίνῃ οὐδέν? ἴδε, πόσα σου κατηγοροῦσιν!	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these sentences, since the second sentence gives the reason for the question in the first sentence. Alternate translation: “See how many things they are accusing you! Do you not answer anything?”
15:4	q7m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἀποκρίνῃ οὐδέν	1	The words translated **not** and **anything** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “Do you answer nothing”
15:4	s2as			οὐκ ἀποκρίνῃ οὐδέν?	1	Alternate translation: “Do you have no answer”
15:4	bzlp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἴδε	1	Here Pilate uses the word **See** to refer to hearing or paying attention to something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Hear” or “Consider”
15:5	uqca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ὁ & Ἰησοῦς οὐκέτι οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίθη	1	The words translated **no longer** and **anything** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “Jesus answered nothing at all”
15:5	way9			ὁ & Ἰησοῦς οὐκέτι οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίθη	1	Alternate translation: “But Jesus gave no more answers”
15:5	camx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε θαυμάζειν	1	Here, the phrase **so as to** introduces a result clause. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a result clause. Alternate translation: “so that he amazed”
15:6	ul19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Here Mark provides background information about something that Pilate, the governor, normally did. This background information will help readers understand what happens next. Use a natural form in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “Here is some important information:”\n
15:6	v8sw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑορτὴν	1	Here, the phrase **the festival** refers to the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread, as indicated in [14:1](../14/01.md).

It could be that people thought that the **myrrh** would lessen the pain that Jesus was going to experience. If possible, refer to the **myrrh** without explaining why it would be **mixed** in. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include some of this information in a footnote.

If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was the soldiers. Alternate translation: “which one of the soldiers had written”
15:26	c0zf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ὁ Βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	Here the soldiers continue mock Jesus by referring to him as if he were **King of the Jews** when they do not believe that he actually is.

See how you expressed the similar idea in [15:18](../15/18.md). Alternate translation: “The so-called King of the Jews”\n

15:29	a7ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	οὐὰ	1	Here, the word **Aha** expresses mock surprise.

15:32	ljm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἴδωμεν καὶ πιστεύσωμεν	1	Here the Jewish leaders imply that they **might see** Jesus coming down from the cross and then they **might believe** that he really is **the Christ, the King of Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “we might see him come down and might believe that he really is the Christ”
15:32	dcb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνεσταυρωμένοι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

15:33	q1gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὥρας ἕκτης & ὥρας ἐνάτης	1	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. So, **the sixth hour** would be around noon, and **the ninth hour** would be around three o’clock in the afternoon.

Mark has spelled the words out using Greek letters so his readers would know how they sounded. Since Mark states what these words mean later in the verse, you also should spell them out the way they sound in your language.
15:34	qw71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

15:40	gkgi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Mark uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens later in the story.

The UST has moved **Salome** earlier in the list so that it is clear that she is not one of the children of **Mary**. Alternate translation: “also Mary Magdalene and Salome and Mary the mother of James the little and of Joses”
15:40	zc9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρία ἡ & μήτηρ	1	The word **Mary** is the name of a woman. This **Mary** was not **Mary Magdalene** nor Mary the mother of Jesus. Mark identifies her instead as **the mother of James the younger and of Joses**.

This **James** is not James the brother of Jesus, James son of Zebedee, or James son of Alphaeus. The word **Joses** is also the name of a man. This **Joses** is not Jesus’ brother.
15:40	z5ra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ	1	When Mark refers to **James** as **the little**, he could mean that: (1) he was younger than one or more other people named James.

Alternate translation: “of James the less” or “of the less famous James” (3) he was a short man. Alternate translation: “of James the short”

15:41	hrel		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἠκολούθουν αὐτῷ	1	Here, the phrase **were following him** indicates that these three women had traveled with Jesus and were his disciple.

Alternate translation: “And Joseph, the one from Arimathea, a respected member of the council who also himself was waiting for the kingdom of God, came. And evening already having come, because it was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, having dared, he entered in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus”

Mark assumes that his readers will know that Jews would not move or bury a body on the **Sabbath** (the next day). He also assumes that his readers will know that the law includes a command to bury on the same day anyone who was executed as Jesus was (see [Deuteronomy 21:22–23](../deu/21/22.md)). So, if he wanted bury Jesus’ body, Joseph needed to receive the body and bury it quickly, before the next day began. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include this information in a footnote or make some of it more explicit in your translation. Alternate translation: “evening already having come, because it was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath when no one could bury anyone”
15:42	ug97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρασκευή, ὅ ἐστιν προσάββατον	1	Here, as Mark indicates **the Day of Preparation** is **the day before the Sabbath**. On this day, Jews would prepare for the Sabbath so that they would not have to do work on that day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit.

15:44	cnlz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ ἤδη τέθνηκεν	1	Here Mark means that Pilate was not sure whether Jesus **had already died**, but he **marveled** that it might be true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates this kind of possibility. Alternate translation: “because it was possible that Jesus had already died”
15:44	f484		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν κεντυρίωνα	1	Here Mark implies that this is the same **centurion** who was in charge of crucifying Jesus (see [15:39](../15/39.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the centurion who was in charge of Jesus’ crucifixion” or “the centurion who oversaw Jesus’ execution”
15:44	u9o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἐπηρώτησεν αὐτὸν εἰ πάλαι ἀπέθανεν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “he asked him, ‘Has he already died?’”
15:45	z3gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γνοὺς ἀπὸ τοῦ κεντυρίωνος	1	Here Mark implies that Pilate **learned** that Jesus really was dead. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having learned from the centurion that Jesus had already died”
15:45	v5ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐδωρήσατο τὸ πτῶμα τῷ Ἰωσήφ	1	Here Mark implies that Pilate commanded his soldiers to give **the corpse** to Joseph. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he told his soldiers to let Joseph have the corpse” or “he permitted Joseph to take the corpse”
15:46	g4c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σινδόνα & τῇ σινδόνι	1	The term **linen cloth** refers to a high-quality cloth made from the fibers of the flax plant. If your readers would be unfamiliar with **linen**, you could use a general expression. See how you translated **linen** in [14:51](../14/51.md). Alternate translation: “a fine cloth … in the fine cloth”\n
15:46	eb9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθελὼν αὐτὸν, ἐνείλησεν τῇ σινδόνι, καὶ ἔθηκεν αὐτὸν ἐν μνήματι ὃ ἦν λελατομημένον ἐκ πέτρας; καὶ προσεκύλισεν λίθον ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τοῦ μνημείου	1	Here Mark implies that other people helped Joseph when he took Jesus’ body down from the cross, prepared it for the tomb, laid it in the tomb, and rolled a stone against the entrance to the tomb in order to close it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Joseph and the people who helped him took Jesus’ body down, wrapped the body in the linen cloth, and put it in a tomb, which was having been cut from rock. And they rolled a stone against the door of the tomb”
15:46	wh20		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθελὼν αὐτὸν	1	Here Mark implies that Joseph took Jesus’ body **down** from the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having taken him down off the cross”
15:46	ugph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐνείλησεν τῇ σινδόνι	1	This was the burial custom in this culture. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could indicate that more explicitly, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “he wrapped him in a linen burial cloth” or “he prepared him for burial”
15:46	fflq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἦν λελατομημένον ἐκ πέτρας	1	Here Mark means specifically a burial place that had been **cut** or chiseled out of **rock**, most likely into the face of a cliff. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of burial place, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “was having been chiseled into the rock” or “which had been specially prepared”
15:46	g9hf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἦν λελατομημένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Mark implies that it was people whom Joseph had hired. Alternate translation: “people had previously cut” or “Joseph had had people cut”
15:46	dfhm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσεκύλισεν λίθον ἐπὶ τὴν θύραν τοῦ μνημείου	1	Here Matthew implies that Joseph **rolled** the **stone** to close up the **tomb**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb to close it up”
15:47	ltht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces something that was happening at the same time as what Mark narrated in the previous verse (Joseph burying Jesus’ body). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a simultaneous action, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Meanwhile,” or “While Joseph was doing those things,”
15:47	yexp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρία ἡ Ἰωσῆτος	1	The word **Mary** is the name of a woman, the same woman whom Mark referred to in [15:40](../15/40.md). This **Mary** was not **Mary Magdalene** nor Mary the mother of Jesus. Mark identifies her instead as **the {mother} of Joses**.
15:47	m782		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσῆτος	1	The word **Joses** is also the name of a man, the same man whom Mark referred to in [15:40](../15/40.md). This **Joses** is not Jesus’ brother.
15:47	v3wu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τέθειται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was Joseph of Arimathea. Alternate translation: “Joseph of Arimathea had put him”
16:intro	j5yz				0	# Mark 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n8. Jesus’ resurrection (16:1–8)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The “young man”\n\nMark indicates that a “young man” clothed in white was sitting inside the tomb. He implies that this “young man” was an angel who appeared in human form. This is supported by how Matthew tells the story, since he indicates explicitly that an angel was at the tomb (see [Matthew 28:2–7](../mat/28/02.md)). Both Luke mentions two men at the tomb, whom he implies are angels ([Luke 24:4–7](../luk/24/04.md)), and John refers to two angels ([John 20:12–13](../jhn/20/12.md)). It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include some information about these men, or angels, in a footnote.\n\n### The resurrection\n\nMark does not narrate the resurrection, but he does indicate that the stone was rolled away from the tomb and that an angel in the form of a young man told the women that Jesus had resurrected. It is not clear exactly when Jesus actually rose from the dead, although it is clear that this happened before the tomb was opened. When Jesus rose from the dead, he was a living human being again, and he could never die again. Make sure that it is clear that Jesus came back to life as a living human being.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nAll the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that are given to groups of people. Because of this, all forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, Mark uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 2, 4, and 6. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])\n\n### The ending of Mark’s gospel\n\nThere are at least four different endings to Mark’s Gospel that are found among various ancient manuscripts. However, only two of those are found among the earliest and most reliable manuscripts. One of these endings is the text of [16:9–20](../16/09.md), which is found in some early manuscripts and many later manuscripts. The other ending, the one found in the early manuscripts that scholars consider to be the most reliable, stops at [16:8](../16/08.md) and does not include any further words. The ULT and UST include [16:9–20](../16/09.md) in brackets, and there are no translation notes on these verses. If you do include these verses in your translation, it is recommended that you put them in a footnote or in brackets to indicate that some of the earliest manuscripts do not include them.
16:1	c21a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **And** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Then,”
16:1	p61n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διαγενομένου τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	Here Mark indicates that the sun had set on Saturday, which meant that **the Sabbath** had ended. The three women were now permitted to do work, like buying **spices**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when it was evening and the Sabbath had ended” or “the Sabbath having passed at sunset and the period of rest having ended”
16:1	fd3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἡ Μαρία ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ, καὶ Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου, καὶ Σαλώμη	1	Consider how you might naturally include a list of three women with descriptions of them. The UST has moved **Salome** earlier in the list so that it is clear that she is not one of the children of **Mary**. Alternate translation: “Mary Magdalene and Salome and Mary the mother of James”
16:1	fm8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου	1	The word **Mary** is the name of a woman, the same woman whom Mark referred to in [15:40](../15/40.md) and [15:47](../15/47.md). This **Mary** was not Mary Magdalene nor Mary the mother of Jesus. Mark identifies her instead as **the {mother} of James**.\n
16:1	m7qt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰακώβου	1	The word **James** is the name of a man, the same man whom Mark referred to in [15:40](../15/40.md). This **James** is not James the brother of Jesus, James son of Zebedee, or James son of Alphaeus.
16:1	nmvs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σαλώμη	1	The word **Salome** is the name of a woman. She is the same woman whom Mark referred to in [15:40](../15/40.md).
16:1	qrhc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀρώματα	1	Here, the word **spices** refers to any good-smelling herbs, ointments, and oils. In Jesus’ culture, it was customary to put these good-smelling things on dead bodies to cover up bad smells and to honor the people who had died. Since the women plan to **anoint** Jesus with these **spices**, the **spices** must be herbs mixed with oil or some kind of ointment. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of good-smelling item, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “pleasant herbs” or “good-smelling oils”
16:1	zrcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθοῦσαι	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “gone” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “having gone”
16:1	g9q0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλείψωσιν αὐτόν	1	In Jesus’ culture, it was customary for people to **anoint** dead bodies when they were buried. Joseph of Arimathea had not done this because he had to bury Jesus quickly before the Sabbath began. These three women now plan to finish the customary burial preparations. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “they might anoint him to complete the burial customs”
16:2	o6qf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λείαν πρωῒ τῇ μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	Here Mark refers to sunrise on **the first of the week**, that is, Sunday. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “very early in the morning on the first of the week, that is, Sunday”\n
16:2	qcmt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ μιᾷ	1	Mark is using the adjective **first** as a noun to mean the first day. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “on the first day”
16:2	jh6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τῇ μιᾷ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “on day one”
16:2	u9b5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνατείλαντος τοῦ ἡλίου	1	Here, the phrase **the sun having come up** refers to sunrise. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that refers to sunrise. Alternate translation: “the sun having risen” or “the sun having appeared above the horizon”
16:3	knly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἔλεγον	1	Here Mark implies that **they were saying** this while they were going to the tomb. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “And as they were going to the tomb, they were saying”
16:3	lv8o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἔλεγον πρὸς ἑαυτάς, τίς ἀποκυλίσει ἡμῖν τὸν λίθον ἐκ τῆς θύρας τοῦ μνημείου?	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “they were asking one another about who would roll away the stone for them from the entrance of the tomb.”
16:4	kld9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀποκεκύλισται ὁ λίθος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “somebody had rolled the stone away”
16:4	ij5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** could introduce: (1) further information about the **stone**. Alternate translation: “and as for that stone,” (2) a reason why the women were able to see the **stone** from far away when they **looked up**. Alternate translation: “which they could observe because” (3) a reason why the women were concerned about who would roll the stone away for them (see [16:3](../16/03.md)). Alternate translation: “and they had been asking each other about the stone because”
16:5	oaqk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς δεξιοῖς	1	Here Mark is referring to the **right side** of the tomb from the women’s perspective. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “inside the tomb on the right side from their perspective”
16:5	cuy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	περιβεβλημένον στολὴν λευκήν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “with a white robe on”
16:5	ei8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξεθαμβήθησαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was what the women saw. Alternate translation: “these things alarmed them”
16:6	q47y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces what the young man says in contrast to how the women reacted. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “However,”
16:6	mo0d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ ἐκθαμβεῖσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be what the women saw. See how you expressed the similar phrase in [16:5](../16/05.md). Alternate translation: “These things must not alarm you”\n
16:6	ie57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν ἐσταυρωμένον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was Pilate’s soldiers. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate’s soldiers crucified”
16:6	x6ne		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἠγέρθη	1	Here, the word **raised** refers to someone who died coming back to life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He was restored to life”
16:6	x9m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, the young man could be implying that: (1) God did it. Alternate translation: “God raised him up” (2) Jesus himself did it. Alternate translation: “He rose up”\n
16:6	wf0l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἴδε	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the three women and asks them to look at something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **behold** with a word or phrase that asks someone to look or pay attention. Alternate translation: “See” or “Observe”
16:6	ni6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ τόπος ὅπου ἔθηκαν αὐτόν	1	Here the young man refers to **the place** within the tomb where Joseph of Arimathea and his helpers **put** Jesus’ body. This **place** was probably a shelf or ledge. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “this is the flat area where they put his body” or “this is the ledge within this tomb where they put him”
16:7	fc4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a command that contrasts with what the young man said in the previous verse about seeing where Jesus’ body lay. Now, in contrast, the angel commands the women to leave the tomb. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,” or “But do not stay here. Instead,”
16:7	x3u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς μαθηταῖς αὐτοῦ καὶ τῷ Πέτρῳ	1	The phrase **and to Peter** is not making a distinction between **Peter** and the disciples by indicating that **Peter** is not part of the group of Jesus’ **disciples**. Rather, the phrase **and Peter** is being used to emphasize that of all of the disciples of Jesus, these women should take special care to tell **Peter** the information that follows this phrase. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to Peter and to the rest of his disciples” or “to his disciples, and particularly to Peter”
16:7	axgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Πέτρῳ, ὅτι προάγει ὑμᾶς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν; ἐκεῖ αὐτὸν ὄψεσθε, καθὼς εἶπεν ὑμῖν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “to Peter that Jesus is going before them to Galilee and that they will see him there, just as he said to them”
16:7	mk04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	προάγει	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “coming” instead of **going**. Alternate translation: “He is coming before”\n
16:8	m1eg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐξελθοῦσαι, ἔφυγον ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου; εἶχεν γὰρ αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because trembling and amazement was gripping them, having gone out, they ran from the tomb”
16:8	dlji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθοῦσαι	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: “having come out”
16:8	bdgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἶχεν & αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	Here, when **trembling and amazement** are **gripping** people, it means that these people are overcome by **trembling and amazement**. In other words, they cannot help but experience these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they were overcome by trembling and amazement” or “they could not help but experience trembling and amazement”
16:8	sh40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἶχεν & αὐτὰς τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **amazement**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “they were trembling and greatly amazed”
16:8	trqu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τρόμος καὶ ἔκστασις	1	Here Mark implies that the women were **trembling** because of their **amazement**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “trembling because of amazement”
16:8	feiu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐδενὶ οὐδὲν εἶπον; ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they were afraid, they said nothing to anyone”
16:8	ydb0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδενὶ οὐδὲν εἶπον	1	The words translated **nothing** and **to anyone** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “they told no one anything”\n
