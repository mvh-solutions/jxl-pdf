The outline above attempts to offer a reasonable and general way of outlining this book but there are other possible ways this book could be outlined.\n\n### What is the Song of Songs about?\n\nThe Song of Songs is a poem or a series of poems that celebrate love and intimacy between a man and a woman. Jews traditionally have interpreted the book as a picture of God’s love for his people Israel. Until the 1800’s the main view among Christians was that this book is primarily a picture of love between Christ and his bride, Christians. Since the 1800’s the more common view of the meaning of this book among Christians is that it is a poem or a series of poems that give a beautiful picture of love between a man and a woman. Many Christians also think that even though the main meaning of this poem is to give a beautiful portrayal of romantic love between a man and a woman, that there are lessons in this book to be learned about God’s love for his bride, Christians.\n\n### Who wrote the Song of Songs?\n\nThe first verse of the book (“The song of songs, which is of Solomon”) gives the idea that King Solomon of Israel wrote it. However, there are different possible ways to interpret the meaning of this title. A translation note for this verse discusses the different possible meanings.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book is traditionally titled “Song of Songs,” which means the very best song, or “Song of Solomon.” It may also be called “Songs of Love,” “Great Poems of Love,” or “The Love Songs of Solomon.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What place do the descriptions of sexual behavior have in the Song of Songs?\n\nThe Song of Songs approves of sexual behavior expressing love between a husband his wife.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How many characters are in the Song of Songs?\n\nThe two main characters in this book are the man and the woman, who love each other. In [8:8-9](../08/08.md) the woman’s brothers speak among themselves and in different places throughout the book a group of women called the “daughters of Jerusalem,” speak or are spoken to. However, it is possible that the group of women is not real and that the woman only imagined them and that they are put into the poem for poetic effect.\n\nSome interpreters believe there may be more characters than these, but this is not certain. The ULT and UST versions recognize only the man, the woman, the group of women (and possibly a group of friends in some parts), and the woman’s brothers.\n\n### What are the lines in the UST about people speaking?\n\nThe Song of Songs is a poem that shows the thoughts and words of a man, a woman, the woman’s friends, and the woman’s brothers. Throughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience. So to help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about who is speaking.\n\nBefore each speech, the UST has a header which identifies the speaker and often the audience in ways like this: “The woman speaking to the women of Jerusalem,” “The woman speaking to the man,” “The man speaking to the woman,” or “The woman speaking to herself.” Translators are encouraged to include these ways of identifying the speaker and the audience, and to format them differently from the scripture text. The translators should also include an initial note explaining that these explanations are not actually part of the text of scripture.\n\n\nThere are different views among Bible scholars about who the man is who is in love with the woman, whether it is a shepherd boy or king Solomon or whether both speak in this book at various times and are competing for the woman’s love. The headers in the UST will indicate when them man is speaking or being spoken to with headers such as “The man speaking to the woman he loves” and “The woman speaking to the man she loves,” but will not indicate the identity of the man.\n\n### How should one translate the Song of Songs if the readers will view certain terms as coarse, vulgar, or improper?\n\nReaders might consider many images or forms appearing in the Song of Songs as improper when translated. The translator should try to avoid offensive language if possible, by using expressions that will not cause offense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])\n\n### How do I translate metaphors and similes in this book?\n\nThere are many metaphors and similes in this book. These figures of speech are used to add poetic beauty and emotional effect, however their meaning is sometimes unclear and sometimes it is unclear whether or not there is a sexual meaning intended or a double meaning (both a literal and a sexual meaning). However, though meanings are often unclear, it is not always necessary to clarify the meaning and often ambiguity in translation is best. You can translate the words as they are written in order to avoid committing to a specific meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n\n### Translating terms of endearment\n\n\nThe word the ULT translates as “my beloved” occurs 26 times in this book and each time it occurs the woman uses it to refer to the man she loves. You should translate this term consistently throughout this book. The word the ULT translates as “my darling” appears nine times in this book. Each time it occurs the man uses it to refer the woman he loves. You should translate this term consistently throughout the book.\n\n\n
1:intro	xrm2				0	# Song of Songs 1 General Notes\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common to describe a woman using metaphors involving animals. In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different metaphors of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### The lines indicating who is speaking and who is being spoken to.\n\nThroughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience. So to help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about who is speaking. Before each speech, the UST has a header which identifies the speaker and the audience. You may wish to do the same in your translation.\n\n### “I am black”\n\nIn the ancient Near East, rich people usually had lighter skin because they did not need to work outside in the sun. This young woman had to work outside in the sun, and her skin became dark as a result and this is why she says “I am black” in [1:5-6](../01/05.md).

1:1	qbe2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	שִׁ֥יר הַ⁠שִּׁירִ֖ים	1	The possessive form is being used here to indicate a comparison with other **songs** and to show that this **song** is the best or greatest of all **songs**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use another form to indicate this. Alternate translation: “The best song” or “The most excellent song” or “The greatest song”
1:1	r5ns			לִ⁠שְׁלֹמֹֽה	1	The phrase **of Solomon** could mean: (1) Solomon wrote this song. Alternate translation: “Solomon wrote” (2) this song was dedicated to Solomon. Alternate translation: “is dedicated to Solomon” (3) this song was about Solomon. Alternate translation: “is about Solomon”

Your language may have a way of indicating speech that is expressed toward a person who is not present to hear what is being said.
1:2	tulv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	יִשָּׁקֵ֨⁠נִי֙ מִ⁠נְּשִׁיק֣וֹת פִּ֔י⁠הוּ	1	The author is using an emphatic form to indicate the fervor and intensity of the desired kisses.

1:3	si36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁמָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ טוֹבִ֔ים	1	Here, **oils** refers to colognes or perfumes. In the authors culture pleasant smelling spices were mixed into olive oil in order to make a pleasant smelling perfume which was then put on the skin. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. If men do not put pleasant smelling things on their skin in your culture you could say that the man being spoken of here smells pleasant. Alternate translation: “your colognes—they are good” or “your scented oils—they are good” or “your skin—it is good” or “your body—it is good”

1:4	gec8			מָשְׁכֵ֖⁠נִי	1	Alternate translation: “Lead me”
1:4	v83t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	אַחֲרֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	The word **you** refers to the man and so is singular. Your language may require you to mark this form. In this book every occurrence of the words **you** and **your** are singular.
1:4	ty2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נָּר֑וּצָה	1	The word **us** refers to the young woman and the man that she is addressing so **us** is inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “let you and I run”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “let us hurry”
1:4	vpdi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	Here, the woman speaks of the man she loves as if he were **The king**. Here, the term **king** is a term of endearment and is an affectionate way for the woman to refer to the man she loves. The woman is not speaking of an actual king but rather this is a poetic way of speaking. The woman is still speaking of the same man that she was speaking of in [1:2-3](../01/02.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning by using a simile. Alternate translation: “He whom I love is like a king to me and” or “He who is like a king to me”
1:4	ieqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֱבִיאַ֨⁠נִי הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	The original language word which the ULT translates as **he has brought me** could be describing: (1) a request or wish that the woman has.

Alternate translation: “We will be glad and rejoice in you. We will profess your love more than wine” (2) be the woman continuing to speak to the man she loves and using **us** to refer to herself. Alternate translation: “May I be glad and rejoice in you. May I profess your love more than wine” (3) be the woman continuing to speak and using **us** to refer to herself and the man. Alternate translation: “Let you and I be glad and rejoice in you. Let you and I profess your love more than wine”\n 
1:4	isr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נָּר֑וּצָה&נָגִ֤ילָה & נַזְכִּ֤ירָה	1	The word **us** is inclusive all three times that it occurs in this verse. Your language may require you to mark these forms.
1:4	ku0t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	נָגִ֤ילָה וְ⁠נִשְׂמְחָה֙	1	The terms **glad** and **rejoice** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “the way you love is better than wine” or “the way you love me is better than wine”
1:4	so9x			מֵישָׁרִ֖ים אֲהֵבֽוּ⁠ךָ	1	Here the speaker could be: (1) the woman speaking to the man about the young women who admire him. Alternate translation: “rightly do the young women love you” (2) the young women speaking of other women who admire the man. Alternate translation: “rightly do the other young women love you” or “rightly do the young women love you”. You may wish to indicate who the presumed speaker is here by placing a heading above this section as modeled by the UST.
1:4	gxfw			אֲהֵבֽוּ⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: “do they admire you” 
1:4	ag8r			מֵישָׁרִ֖ים אֲהֵבֽוּ⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: “it is right that other young women adore you” or “no wonder other young women adore you”

1:5	jpj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְֽ⁠נָאוָ֔ה	1	Here, the word **but** is introducing a contrast. What follows the word **but** is in contrast to what was expected, because in the author’s culture it was not considered attractive for a woman to have skin that was dark as a result of much exposure to the sun. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “yet lovely” or “but still lovely” 
1:5	ck9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּנ֖וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	The woman is using the possessive form to poetically describe where the young women (whom she calls **daughters**) live. The phrase **daughters of Jerusalem** refers to the young women who were from the city of Jerusalem (These are probably the same women as the “marriageable women” in [1:3](../01/03.md) and the women referred to as “they” in [1:4](../01/04.md)). If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could indicate the association between these young women and **Jerusalem** in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “daughters from Jerusalem” or “young women from Jerusalem” 
1:5	rbb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠אָהֳלֵ֣י קֵדָ֔ר כִּ⁠ירִיע֖וֹת שְׁלֹמֹֽה	1	The Kedar were a tribe of people who used black goat skins to make their tents, thus their tents were dark in color. The woman is comparing her skin to these tents which were dark in color. The phrase **the curtains of Solomon** refers to the curtains in Solomon’s palace which were very beautiful. The point of the first comparison is that the woman’s skin was dark (referring back to and further describing the word **black**) and the point of the second comparison is that the woman was beautiful (referring back to and further describing the word **lovely**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent comparisons from your culture or you could retain these similes and express these meanings as plainly as possible. Alternate translation: “like the dark color of the tents of the people of the tribe Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon’s palace” or “as dark as the color of the tents of Kedar, as beautiful as the curtains in Solomon’s palace” 
1:6	avcq			אַל־ תִּרְא֨וּ⁠נִי֙	1	The phrase **Do not look at me** could mean: (1) that the woman does not want people to look at her with contempt. Alternate translation: “Do not look at me with contempt” or “Do not look down on me” or “Do not look at me disapprovingly” (2) that the woman does not want people to stare at her in admiration of her beauty. Alternate translation: “Do not stare at me because I am so beautiful”  
1:6	gy5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שֶׁ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	The word **that** indicates that what follows is a reason for what came before. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: “because I” 
1:6	nqqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֶׁ⁠אֲנִ֣י שְׁחַרְחֹ֔רֶת	1	Here, **I am black** means “my skin is black” or “my skin is very dark” as it did in [1:5](../01/05.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that my skin is black” or “that my skin is very dark”
1:6	im6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שֶׁ⁠שֱּׁזָפַ֖תְ⁠נִי הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	The word **that** indicates that what follows is a reason for what came before. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: “because the sun scorched me” 
1:6	thz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֶׁ⁠שֱּׁזָפַ֖תְ⁠נִי הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	The phrase **the sun scorched me** refers to sunlight shining on the skin and means “the sun burned me” or “the sun tanned my skin dark.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that the sun burned me” or “that the sun turned my skin brown” or “that the sun tanned my skin”
1:6	v86f			נֹטֵרָ֣ה אֶת־הַ⁠כְּרָמִ֔ים כַּרְמִ֥⁠י שֶׁ⁠לִּ֖⁠י לֹ֥א נָטָֽרְתִּי	1	Alternate translation: “as caretaker of the vineyards—my vineyard that is mine, I have not taken care of”
1:6	w18k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּרְמִ֥⁠י שֶׁ⁠לִּ֖⁠י לֹ֥א נָטָֽרְתִּי	1	The woman is probably using the phrase **my vineyard** to refer to her complexion. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my skin, I have not protected from the sun” or “my complexion, I have not protected from the sun” 
1:7	f9hi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שֶׁ֤⁠אָהֲבָה֙ נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	The woman is using one part of herself, her **soul**, to represent all of her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you whom I love” 
1:7	mpbu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵיכָ֣ה תִרְעֶ֔ה	1	The woman is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “where do you graze your flock” or “where do you graze your sheep”
1:7	wsmm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֵיכָ֣ה תִרְעֶ֔ה אֵיכָ֖ה תַּרְבִּ֣יץ בַּֽ⁠צָּהֳרָ֑יִם	1	The phrase **where do you graze** and the phrase **Where do you make your flocks lie down at noontime** mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying very similar things twice might confuse your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “Where do you pasture your flocks in the middle of the day”  
1:7	v54w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	שַׁ⁠לָּ⁠מָ֤ה אֶֽהְיֶה֙ כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	The woman is not asking for information, but is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate her words as a statement, a request, or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I do not want to be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions” or “Please do not let me be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions” or “Tell me so that I will not be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions”
1:7	f5eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	The phrase **covers herself** means **covers herself with a veil** and the phrase **your companions** refers to the other shepherds who pastured their animals near the flocks of the man and were probably his friends. If it would help your readers, you could express these phrases explicitly. Alternate translation: “like a woman who covers herself with a veil beside the flocks of the other shepherds”
1:7	v6rs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	שַׁ⁠לָּ⁠מָ֤ה אֶֽהְיֶה֙ כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	In the authors culture women who were prostitutes often covered their faces with a veil so that people would not recognize them. It would not be normal for a young unmarried woman to be wandering among shepherds and the woman did not want to be mistaken for a prostitute. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “Tell me where you pasture your flocks so that I will not need to wander around among the flocks of your companions like a prostitute when I am looking for you” or “For why should I be like a prostitute who covers herself with a veil and wanders about beside the flocks of your companions”
1:8	lc64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	אִם־ לֹ֤א תֵדְעִי֙ לָ֔⁠ךְ הַ⁠יָּפָ֖ה בַּ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים צְֽאִי־ לָ֞⁠ךְ	1	If it would help your readers to see that this is a conditional statement then you could supply a word like “then” in your translation. Alternate translation: “If you do not know, most beautiful among women, then go out”

The king of Egypt’s horses were known to be the best in the world and so they would have been very beautiful. If it would help your readers you could explain the point of this comparison. Alternate translation: “Your beauty is like the beauty of Pharaoh’s chariot horses” or “I compare your beauty to the beauty of Pharaoh’s chariot horses” 
1:9	zyj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠רִכְבֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	The man is using the phrase **the chariots** to mean “the horses that pull the chariots.”  If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “among the horses that pull Pharaoh’s chariots” or “among the horses that pull the chariots of Pharaoh”
1:9	lnbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Here, the term **Pharaoh** does not refer to a specific Egyptian king but is a title used to designate the acting king of Egypt.

1:10	hrjd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠תֹּרִ֔ים	1	The term the man uses, which the ULT translates as **earrings**, is a term which refers to strings of small ornaments or jewels which apparently hung down the side of one’s face. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of jewelry you could use a more general term and, if you are using footnotes, you could make a footnote explaining this type of jewelry.

The man is not including the woman so **we** would be exclusive. Your may language require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “Earring of gold I will have someone make for you” or “I will pay someone to make earring of gold for you” (2) because he is using a commonly accepted use of the plural in his language and expects the woman to understand that he means “I.” Alternate translation: “Earrings of gold I will make for you” (3) because a group of people are speaking here and not the man. If you are using section headers you can place a header above this section indicating who you think is speaking.

The woman makes a comparison between the enjoyable experience of having a bag of myrrh near her and the enjoyable experience of having the man she loves near her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a simile to show the comparison. Alternate translation: “I enjoy having my beloved near me throughout the night like I enjoy the smell of a bag of myrrh”
1:13	d77b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠מֹּ֤ר	1	**myrrh** was a pleasant smelling incense that was made from resin taken from the bark of a certain kind of tree.

Alternate translation: “My beloved stays very close to me during the night, like a bundle of myrrh hanging near my chest”
1:13	bl0z			יָלִֽין	1	Here, the original language word that the ULT translates with the phrase **it stays** is ambiguous regarding what it is that **stays**. This word could: (1) indicate that the **bundle of myrrh** is what **stays**, in which case it should be translated as something similar to **it stays** as modeled by the ULT.  (2) mean that the man **stays**. Alternate translation: “he stays”  
1:13	jw0u			יָלִֽין	1	Here, the word **stays** could: (1) refer to staying in one place for a prolonged period of time in which case you could translate this word with something similar to **stays** as modeled by the ULT. (2) refer to lying down. Alternate translation: “it lies”
1:14	a6jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּ֤פֶר	1	The phrase **henna blossoms** refers to **blossoms** from the **henna** plant which produces clusters of flower blossoms which have a pleasant smell. If your readers would not be familiar with this plant, you could use the name of a plant in your area that has a pleasant smell, you could explain in your translation that henna is a plant that produces fragrant blossoms, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “fragrant flowers” or “fragrant blossoms from the henna plant”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a simile to show the comparison. Because the woman describes her body in a poetic way with images, it is recommended that you either maintain these images or select images from your context and language that communicate the same concepts. Alternate translation: “I enjoy being near my beloved’s body like I enjoy the smell of the henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi” or “I delight in my beloved being near my body like I enjoy the smell of the henna flowers in the vineyards of Engedi”

1:16	q43e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַרְשֵׂ֖⁠נוּ	1	Here, **couch** does not refer to a literal couch but rather to the place where the couple would lie down in the forest.

1:16	xed8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רַעֲנָנָֽה	1	Here, the word that the ULT translates as **leafy** refers to plants that are a green color. You could translate **leafy** in a general way such as “green” or if it would help your readers you could indicate specifically what vegetation the word **leafy** refers to.

2:intro	u8uv				0	# Song of Songs 2 General Notes\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n\n### The woman and man complement each other by using metaphors and similes \n\n\nIn 2:1 the woman uses a metaphor to tell the man she loves that she thinks she is common like a flower that grows on the plains or a lily that grows in the valleys. The man responds in 2:2 by using a simile to tell her how special he thinks she is when compared to other women. She then uses a simile in 2:3 to tell him how special she thinks he is compared to other men. When translating these verses one will need to pay close attention to the translation notes and the UST in order to understand the meaning.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary a device called a “chiasm” (sometimes called “chiasmus”). A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB-BA sequence. In [Song of Songs 2:14](../02/14.md) the author uses a chiasm. The ULT follows the Hebrew order and translates this verse as “show me **your appearance**, make me hear **your voice**, for **your voice** {is} sweet, and **your appearance** {is} lovely” (the repeated phrases are highlighted for the purpose of illustration). Notice that the phrases “your appearance” and “your voice” are repeated in this verse and they are repeated in an AB-BA sequence: “your appearance...your voice...your voice...your appearance.”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, explain the comparison, or use a simile as modeled by the UST. The reason the woman compares herself to these wildflowers is to express that she thinks she has only common beauty and is no more attractive than other young women her age. Alternate translation: “I am as common as a wildflower of Sharon or a lily of the valleys” or “My beauty is as common as a wildflower in Sharon or a lily of the valleys”
2:1	ps9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חֲבַצֶּ֣לֶת	1	The original word which the ULT translates as **flower** refers to a specific type of flower which grows on the ground. The exact type of flower that the original word refers to cannot be known with certainty so you could use the name of a pretty wildflower in your area or you could use a general term as modeled by the ULT.
2:1	gh6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠שָּׁר֔וֹן	1	**Sharon** was the name of a specific plain (a flat area) and the word itself refers to a flat, wide area and so by using the word **Sharon** the woman is probably referring to “plains” in general and expressing that she is like a wildflower that grows on the plains. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST.

The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying very similar things twice might confuse your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “I am a wildflower that grows in the plains and the valleys”

The point of this comparison is that in the same way that **a lily** is much more beautiful than **thorns** so the woman is much more beautiful than the other young women.

2:3	yr6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כְּ⁠תַפּ֨וּחַ֙	1	An **apple tree** is a tree that produces **apples**, a round, pleasant tasting fruit that is about the size of an adult human’s fist and has a pleasant smell. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of fruit, you could use the name of a similar fruit in your area that grows on trees or you could use a more general term. (Bible scholars are not totally certain that the word the ULT translates as **apple** refers to an apple. It could refer to an apricot or another type of fruit so if your readers are not familiar with apples but they are familiar with apricots you could “apricot” instead of a general term.

The word **shadow** refers to the shade of an apple tree which would give protection from the sun and refreshment. To **sit** represents being near or in the presence of the man. The phrase **his fruit is sweet** means that he causes the woman to experience pleasurable feelings in a way that is comparable to eating sweet fruit. If it is possible in your language you should try to retain the images used here, or substitute a comparable image if needed. If you are not able to retain the metaphors without causing misunderstanding, you could use similes or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He provides me with refreshment and protection when I am in his presence, he gives me great pleasure” or “I sit in his presence and he refreshes and protects me. He is delightful to me like sweet fruit”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly or use a general expression that allows for either meaning.

2:4	hxuz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	בֵּ֣ית הַ⁠יָּ֔יִן	1	Here, **house of wine** most likely does not refer to a literal **house of wine** but instead the woman is probably using this phrase to poetically describe a private meeting place where they could enjoy expressing their love for each other. She is describing their meeting place by using an image that was meaningful in that culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could retain the literal translation **house of wine** and explain the meaning in a footnote (if you are using them), or you could express the meaning using a different expression that is meaningful in your culture, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our meeting place so that we could enjoy our love” or ”the place where we could celebrate our love for each other” or ”the place where we could consummate our love”
2:4	rp8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠דִגְל֥⁠וֹ עָלַ֖⁠י אַהֲבָֽה	1	The woman is speaking of the man’s **love** for her as if it were a **banner**.

Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if your readers are unfamiliar with raisins and/or **apples** and you do not have an equivalent food or foods that you could substitute for them here you could combine these two phrases into one and use a general expression. Alternate translation: “Sustain and refresh me with fruit” or “strengthen me with fruit” or “strengthen me for love with fruit” 
2:5	ukb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	סַמְּכ֨וּ⁠נִי֙ & רַפְּד֖וּ⁠נִי	1	The phrases **Sustain me** and **refresh me** are plural imperative forms in the original language. The woman is addressing the man using plural forms to show the intensity of her feelings. Your language may allow you to do the same thing. The ULT indicates the intensity that these two plural forms indicate by placing an exclamation point at the end of this verse. Use a natural form in your language for showing intensity of emotion.

Alternate translation: “Because I am sick with love, sustain me with raisin cakes and refresh me with apples”
2:5	khc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בָּֽ⁠אֲשִׁישׁ֔וֹת	1	A **raisin** is a dried grape. Raisin cakes were cakes made of dried grapes pressed together. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of fruit, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “with cakes made of dried fruit”
2:5	gs2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠תַּפּוּחִ֑ים	1	See how you translated the word **apple** in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “with fruit”
2:5	y4qy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כִּי־חוֹלַ֥ת אַהֲבָ֖ה אָֽנִי	1	The woman speaks of feeling **sick with love** because her feelings of love are so strong for the man that they overwhelm her body as if they were a kind of sickness. She is exaggerating in order to emphasize the strength of her feelings for the man. Alternate translation: “for my love for you is so strong that I feel as if I were sick with love” or “because my love for you overwhelms me like a sickness”
2:5	ijwy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַהֲבָ֖ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form as modeled by the UST.

(2) a request or wish that the woman has and not something that has already happened. Alternate translation: “I hope he puts his left arm under my head and holds me close with his right arm” or ”I want him to put his left arm under my head and hold me close with his right arm”
2:7	l67b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	הִשְׁבַּ֨עְתִּי אֶתְ⁠כֶ֜ם בְּנ֤וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙	1	Here, the author portrays the woman speaking to the **daughters of Jerusalem** as if they were present and could hear her but most likely they are not present but rather the author is depicting the woman as addressing the **daughters of Jerusalem** as a poetic way of giving voice to the woman’s feelings. Because the author does this intentionally for poetic effect it is suggested that you do the same. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this in a footnote if you are using them.

You can use a natural way of making a promise in your culture that would be appropriate in this context. Alternate translation: “I urge you to promise me … with the female gazelles or the does of the field as our witnesses” or “Please, promise me … with the female gazelles or the does of the field as our witnesses” or “I want you to make an oath … with the female gazelles or the does of the field listening”

If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could explain the meaning of the phrase **of the field** in your translation. Alternate translation: “by the wild female gazelles and does” or “by the wild female gazelles or the wild does” or “by the female gazelles or the does that live in the wild” 
2:7	sz5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בִּ⁠צְבָא֔וֹת א֖וֹ בְּ⁠אַיְל֣וֹת	1	A gazelle is an animal that is a small antelope and looks like a deer, moves quickly like a deer, and is very similar in size to a deer. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of animal, you could use the name of something similar in your area or if you do not have two deer-like animals in your area or if your language does not have two different words for deer-like animals you could combine the terms **female gazelles** and **does** into one term. Alternate translation: “by the female deer of” or “by the female gazelles of”
2:7	nt79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠אַיְל֣וֹת	1	The term **does** refers to female deer. If it would be helpful to your readers you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the female deer of”

2:7	fz3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	אִם־תָּעִ֧ירוּ ׀ וְֽ⁠אִם־ תְּעֽוֹרְר֛וּ	1	Here, the words **awaken** and **stir** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “do not awaken” or “do not stir up feeling of” 
2:7	z2xm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הָ⁠אַהֲבָ֖ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form as modeled by the UST.

2:8	okuh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamation	הִנֵּה	1	**Behold** is an exclamation word that is used to bring attention to something. Here it is used to bring attention to the man’s approach.

The woman says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to give emphasis to what she is saying. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing in your language, or if you do not have two words for steeply elevated inclines you could combine these two phrases and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “jumping over the mountains!” or “leaping over the hills!”

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “gazing through the windows, yes, looking through the lattice”
2:9	nuxr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	הַֽ⁠חֲלֹּנ֔וֹת & הַֽ⁠חֲרַכִּֽים	1	Here, the words **windows** and **lattices** are plural forms and could: (1) have a plural meaning here indicating that the man was walking around the house and looking into the house through different windows and lattices. If you decide that these two terms have a plural meaning here you can translate them in a similar way to the ULT. (2) be used with singular meanings here. Alternate translation: “the window … the lattice”
2:9	s9xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַֽ⁠חֲרַכִּֽים	1	A “lattice” is a cover inside a window frame that is made by weaving strips of wood together. **lattices** have holes that people can look through.

2:11	asu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ה⁠סתו עָבָ֑ר הַ⁠גֶּ֕שֶׁם חָלַ֖ף	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “the winter has gone; yes, the rain has passed”

He then explains the way in which she is like a dove. If it would be helpful in your language, you could turn this metaphor into a simile and explain the basis of the comparison. Alternate translation: “O my one who is like a dove. You are like a gentle and timid dove which hides in the clefts of the rock and in the hiding places of the cliff” or “You are like a dove. You are like a gentle and shy dove which hides in the clefts of the rock and in the hiding places of the cliff” or “You are like a dove.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea (that the woman seems difficult to reach and far away) with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word such as “yes” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating a similar idea to the first one, not saying something additional. However, if saying similar things twice would confuse your readers you could combine the two lines as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “in the clefts of the rock, yes, in the hiding places of the cliff”

This is called a chiasm. Biblical Hebrew sometimes uses this literary device. If possible, try to follow this AB-BA sequence of presenting the information here. See the [book introduction](../front/intro.md) for more information regarding chiasms. 
2:14	be0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	הַרְאִ֨י⁠נִי֙ אֶתּ־ מַרְאַ֔יִ⁠ךְ הַשְׁמִיעִ֖י⁠נִי	1	The phrases **show me** and **make me hear** are imperatives, but they communicate a polite request rather than a command. Use forms in your language that communicate a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” or “let” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please let me see your appearance, please make me hear” or “let me see you, let me hear”

One interpretation is that the harmful things which **the foxes** symbolize are other men. Catching **the foxes** represents removing these harmful things or protecting against them. The term **vineyards** represents the love the man and woman have for each other. The phrase **in blossom** means that the love they have for each other is developing positively and growing, similar to how a plant blossoms and grows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this verse plainly. Alternate translation: “Get rid of the harmful things that hinder and ruin our relationship, for our relationship is blossoming” or “Remove the little things that destroy our growing relationship” or “There are other men who are like little foxes that ruin vineyards; do not allow those men to attack me”
2:15	dac9			לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ שֽׁוּעָלִ֔ים שֽׁוּעָלִ֥ים קְטַנִּ֖ים	1	The original language word that the ULT translates as **foxes** could refer to: (1) **foxes** in which case you could translate the term as the ULT does.

2:15	170A		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ שֽׁוּעָלִ֔ים שֽׁוּעָלִ֥ים קְטַנִּ֖ים	1	Both **foxes** and jackals are land animals that are similar to small dogs and would ruin vineyards by digging up and eating the budding blossoms that could eventually produce grapes. If your readers would not be familiar with these animals and their habits, you could describe the animal you chose to use in your translation (a fox or a jackal) in general terms or use the name of something similar in your area. Alternate translation: “the dog-like animals for us, the little dog-like animals”
2:15	v31m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ & וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1	Here, the words **us** and **our** refer to the woman and the man, so use the exclusive forms of these words if your language marks that distinction.

2:16	zb2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	דּוֹדִ֥⁠י לִ⁠י֙ וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י ל֔⁠וֹ	1	The woman is speaking as if she is talking about the man to another person even though she is most likely speaking directly to the man. This is common in Hebrew poetry. If this would not be natural in your language you can translate this in a way that indicates that the woman is speaking directly to the man. Alternate translation: “My beloved, you belong to me, and I belong to you”
2:16	lxy4			הָ⁠רֹעֶ֖ה בַּ⁠שּׁוֹשַׁנִּֽים	1	The phrase **the man grazing among the lilies** could mean: (1) that the man himself is grazing among the lilies in which case you can translate this phrase as the ULT does.

2:16	n6c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠רֹעֶ֖ה בַּ⁠שּׁוֹשַׁנִּֽים	1	The woman is speaking of the man as if he were “a gazelle or a young stag” ([2:9](../02/09.md)) that eats **among the lilies**. She is using **lilies** to represent herself as she did in [2:1](../02/01.md). Here, **the lilies** probably specifically represent the woman’s lips. The meaning here is that the man finds sustenance and enjoyment through being with the woman and kissing her lips. If it would help your readers, you could state the meaning plainly as modeled by the UST or you could explain the meaning in a footnote if you are using footnotes in your translation. Alternate translation: “my beloved gets pleasure grazing among the lilies” or “my beloved gets pleasure as he grazes among the lilies”

Alternate translation: “the evening time when the breeze blows and the shadows cast by the sun disappear” (2) the morning when the light from the sun dawns and the morning breeze blows (**breathes**). Alternate translation: “dawn tomorrow morning, when the darkness disappears”\n
2:17	h2b1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠נָ֖סוּ הַ⁠צְּלָלִ֑ים	1	Here, the author is leaving out the word **until** which in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

If you choose this option then in your translation you can spell it the way that it sounds in your language as modeled by the ULT. In this case, you may want to put the meaning in a footnote. (2) be a description of **the mountains**. Alternate translation: “the cleft mountains” or “the rugged mountains” or “the mountain gorges”
3:intro	t72h				0	# Song of Songs 3 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Longing\n\n[3:1-3](../03/01.md) describes the feeling of longing that the woman had for the man she loved and it describes her diligently seeking the man loved. [3:4](../03/04.md) describes the woman finding the man that she loved and her response to finding him, holding onto him and bringing him to her mother’s house. \n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n\n### Whether [3:1-4](../03/01.md) describe a dream, a real event or something imagined\n\nBible scholars do not know for certain whether the events described in [3:1-4](../03/01.md) are real events or something that the woman dreamed in a dream or something that the woman imagined. Many Bible scholars think that [3:1-4](../03/01.md) describe a dream. If you are using footnotes you may wish to explain this in a footnote or you could indicate in a section header whether you think this is a dream, a real event or something that the woman imagined. You could also use a general section header such as “The woman searches for the man she loves at night and finds him” which does not comment on whether this was a dream, a real event or something imagined.
3:1	gagz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	עַל־ מִשְׁכָּבִ⁠י֙ בַּ⁠לֵּיל֔וֹת	1	Because Bible scholars do not know if the events described in [3:1-4](../03/01.md) describe real events or things that happened in a dream or things the woman imagined, you should not expand on or explain the phrase **On my bed in the night** in the actual text of your translation (by adding a phrase like “I dreamed I was” or “I imagined I was”) though you may wish to use a header or a footnote. See the section “Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter” in the Introduction to this chapter for more information. 
3:1	eds0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בַּ⁠לֵּיל֔וֹת	1	In the original language the phrase **in the night** uses a plural form of **night** and could mean: (1) that the woman sought the man during the night. Alternate translation: “during the night” (2) that the woman sought the man throughout the night. Alternate translation: “throughout the night” or “all night long” (3) that the woman sought the man on many nights. Alternate translation: “night after night” or “night upon night”

Hebrew poetry often uses repetition for emphasis. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to show the emphasis here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “I desperately sought him whom my soul loves” or “I earnestly sought him whom my soul loves”

3:2	uyu7			וַ⁠אֲסוֹבְבָ֣ה בָ⁠עִ֗יר	1	Alternate translation: “and walk through the city”
3:2	x9ki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בָ֣⁠רְחֹב֔וֹת	1	The word **squares** refers to spacious open places where people gathered to sell things and conduct other business matters and handle legal matters. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of place, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “and in the open plazas” or “and in the wide open places” 
3:2	afu9			אֲבַקְשָׁ֕ה & בִּקַּשְׁתִּ֖י⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: “I will look for … I looked for him”

3:3	rdd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠שֹּׁ֣מְרִ֔ים 	1	Here, the word **guards** refers to men who had the job of walking about the city during the night for the purpose of keeping the people safe. If your readers would not be familiar with this term you could use the name of a similar role in your area or you could use a more general term as modeled by the UST.
3:3	ha13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵ֛ת שֶׁ⁠אָהֲבָ֥ה נַפְשִׁ֖⁠י רְאִיתֶֽם	1	The woman is asking the **guards** a question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly by introducing this question with words that indicate that this is a question. Alternate translation: “I said to them, “Have you seen him whom my soul loves’” 
3:3	pab8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֵ֛ת שֶׁ⁠אָהֲבָ֥ה נַפְשִׁ֖⁠י 	1	See how you translated the similar phrase “you whom my soul loves” in [1:7](../01/07.md). Alternate translation: “him whom I love”

The second phrase adds additional information to the first one. This is common in Hebrew poetry and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word such as “then” in order to show that the second phrase is adding additional information. Alternate translation: “I had brought him to the house of my mother and then to the room of the woman who had conceived me” 
3:5	a3y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	הִשְׁבַּ֨עְתִּי אֶתְ⁠כֶ֜ם בְּנ֤וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ בִּ⁠צְבָא֔וֹת א֖וֹ בְּ⁠אַיְל֣וֹת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה אִם־תָּעִ֧ירוּ ׀ וְֽ⁠אִם־תְּעֽוֹרְר֛וּ אֶת־הָ⁠אַהֲבָ֖ה עַ֥ד שֶׁ⁠תֶּחְפָּֽץ	1	This verse is identical to [Song of Songs 2:7](../02/07.md). Translate this verse exactly as you translated that verse. This verse is a refrain (a repeated phrase). Refrains are a common feature of poetry. This refrain closes section 2:8-3:5.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. (2) be a request for information. Alternate translation: “Who is it that I see arising from the wilderness like columns of smoke, fragrant smoke of myrrh and frankincense from all the powders of the merchant?”
3:6	si0q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זֹ֗את עֹלָה֙ מִן־הַ⁠מִּדְבָּ֔ר	1	The word translated as **that** here could refer to: (1) Solomon’s “litter,” which is named in the following verse. Alternate translation: “is that group of people that is arising from the wilderness” (2) the woman. Alternate translation: “is this woman that is arising from the wilderness”
3:6	y8wr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹלָה֙	1	The phrase **coming up** is used by the author because the group of people described is traveling **from the wilderness** to Jerusalem. They must travel upward in elevation in order to reach Jerusalem because **the wilderness** is low in the Jordan valley and Jerusalem is built on hills and is therefore high. Use a word or phrase that expresses moving upward in elevation. Alternate translation: “moving upward” or “arising” 
3:6	z138		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	עֹלָה֙	1	Your language may say “going” rather than **coming** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “going up”

Here, the phrase **a column of smoke** is most likely describing a dust cloud created by a group of people traveling in a dry and dusty area. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the basis of comparison. Alternate translation: “creating a dust cloud that resembles a column of smoke, which resembles the fragrant smoke of myrrh and frankincense” 
3:6	ej84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	כְּ⁠תִֽימֲר֖וֹת עָשָׁ֑ן מְקֻטֶּ֤רֶת מוֹר֙ וּ⁠לְבוֹנָ֔ה	1	Here, the phrase **fragrant smoke of myrrh and frankincense** could: (1) be further describing the word **arising**. Alternate translation: “creating dust clouds that resemble rising columns of smoke. Yes, creating dust clouds that resemble the fragrant smoke of myrrh and frankincense” (2) describing the phrase **column of smoke**. Alternate translation: “like a column of smoke, incensed with myrrh and frankincense”
3:6	vbjm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מְקֻטֶּ֤רֶת	1	The author is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply this word from the context. Alternate translation: “like fragrant smoke of” 
3:6	w7kr			מוֹר֙	1	Alternate translation: “the sweet smelling incense made from the resin of a myrrh tree”
3:6	i42j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל אַבְקַ֥ת רוֹכֵֽל	1	The word translated as **from all** could: (1) be introducing **the powders of the merchant** as additional information about **myrrh and frankincense**. Alternate translation: “which are among the powders of the merchant” (2) indicate that **the powders of the merchant** are being introduced as additional things **the merchant** sells. Alternate translation: “and other powders of the merchants”
3:7	ldh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamation	הִנֵּ֗ה	1	**Behold** is an exclamation that is being used to draw people’s attention to what was “arising from the wilderness”. Use an exclamation that would express that meaning in your language as modeled by the UST.
3:7	sa19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מִטָּת⁠וֹ֙	1	A **litter** was a portable bed or couch that important people were carried on from place to place. It was carried by wooden poles that were attached to it. This **litter** probably had a canopy on top of it that functioned as a roof and curtains around it that could be opened and closed. If your readers would be unfamiliar with this term you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a descriptive phrase as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “portable couch”
3:7	ui2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִטָּת⁠וֹ֙ שֶׁ⁠לִּ⁠שְׁלֹמֹ֔ה	1	The phrase **his litter, which belongs to Solomon** could mean: (1) that the woman was riding on the **litter** which belonged to **Solomon** and which he had sent for her. The UST models this interpretation. (2) that **Solomon** himself was riding in the **litter**. Alternate translation: “Solomon riding in his royal portable chair” 
3:8	v2yx			מְלֻמְּדֵ֖י מִלְחָמָ֑ה	1	Alternate translation: “all of them have been trained in warfare” or “all of them have been trained to use their swords”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Each warrior has his sword strapped to his thigh so that it is ready to use against the terrors in the nights” or “Each warrior has his sword ready to use to defend against the terrors in the nights”
3:8	z214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠פַּ֖חַד בַּ⁠לֵּילּֽוֹת	1	The phrase **against the terrors in the nights** means “ready to defend against the terrifying things that could happen on any given night.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “ready to guard against dangers that happen during the night” or “ready to defend against the dangers of the night.”

It does not mean that he made the **palanquin** himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “He had craftsmen make him a palanquin…He had craftsmen make its post with silver” or “He had a palanquin made for him…He had its posts made with silver” 
3:9	nnm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אַפִּרְי֗וֹן	1	Here, the term **palanquin** refers to the same object that the term “litter” referred to in [3:7](../03/07.md). The term **litter** is a general term meaning “couch” or “bed” and the term **palanquin** is a more descriptive word meaning “sedan chair.” You could translate the term **palanquin** the same way you translated “litter” in [3:7](../03/07.md) or you could use a different word or phrase here. Alternate translation: “portable couch” or “sedan chair” 
3:9	hlf4			הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ שְׁלֹמֹ֔ה מֵ⁠עֲצֵ֖י הַ⁠לְּבָנֽוֹן	1	Alternate translation: “King Solomon had it made from the trees in Lebanon” 
3:10	xnj4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַמּוּדָי⁠ו֙ עָ֣שָׂה כֶ֔סֶף	1	The **posts** were made of wood and overlaid with **silver**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “He made its posts of wood that was overlaid with silver” or “He made its posts of wood covered in silver”
3:10	q4nz			רְפִידָת֣⁠וֹ זָהָ֔ב	1	The phrase **its back gold** could mean: (1) that the base or foundation of the “palanquin” was covered in **gold**. Alternate translation: “its foundation of gold” or “its base of gold” (2) the back of the chair was covered in **gold**. Alternate translation: “its back made from gold” 
3:10	akoo			מֶרְכָּב֖⁠וֹ אַרְגָּמָ֑ן	1	Alternate translation: “and covered the cushion with purple cloth”

Alternate translation: “The daughters of Jerusalem fitted its interior with love”
3:10	m0yx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	תּוֹכ⁠וֹ֙ רָצ֣וּף אַהֲבָ֔ה מִ⁠בְּנ֖וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea with an adverb as modeled by the UST or in some other way that is natural in your language.
3:10	oki8			תּוֹכ⁠וֹ֙ רָצ֣וּף אַהֲבָ֔ה מִ⁠בְּנ֖וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	Alternate translation: “The inside of it was lovingly inlaid with decorations by the women of Jerusalem.” 
3:10	bjfn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מִ⁠בְּנ֖וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	See how you translated the phrase **daughters of Jerusalem** in [1:5](../01/05.md).
3:11	zwp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	צְאֶ֧ינָה	1	Your language may say “Come out” rather than **Go out** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “Come out” 
3:11	i961			בְּנ֥וֹת צִיּ֖וֹן	1	The possessive form is used here to describe where the young women live. The phrase **daughters of Zion** is a poetic way of referring to the young women who were from the city of Jerusalem (These are probably the same women as the “marriageable women” in [1:3](../01/03.md) and the women referred to as “daughters of Jerusalem” in [2:7](../02/07.md) and [3:5](../03/05.md)). If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could indicate the association between these young women and **Zion** in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “young women from Zion” or “young women from the city of Zion” or “you young women who live in Zion”
3:11	sfn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠י֣וֹם חֲתֻנָּת֔⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְ⁠י֖וֹם שִׂמְחַ֥ת לִבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “on the day of his wedding, yes, on the day of the joy of his heart”
3:11	zhva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠בְ⁠י֖וֹם שִׂמְחַ֥ת לִבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “joyful” or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “on the day his heart was exceedingly joyful” or “on the day when his heart was very joyful”
3:11	ei7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בְ⁠י֖וֹם שִׂמְחַ֥ת לִבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Solomon’s inner being is being described by association with his **heart**, which the Jews viewed as being the center of a persons being and therefore the center of their mind and inner feelings. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language as modeled by the UST.
4:intro	r3aw				0	# Song of Songs 4 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Beauty\n\nThe man describes the woman he loves as the epitome of beauty and attractiveness in [4:1-4:5](../04/01.md) and in [4:7](../04/07.md). \n\n\n### Feelings of longing to be with one’s lover who seems distant and temporarily inaccessible\n\nIn [4:8](../04/08.md) the man speaks of the woman he loves as if she were far away from him and he invites her to “come with” him and “descend from” the height of three high places and be with him. The woman is not actually dwelling in these places but rather the man is using imaginative and poetic language to describe how he feels about being separated from her and to describe his desire to be with her. In [4:12](../04/12.md) the man uses poetic language to describe the fact that the woman he loves is temporarily inaccessible.\n\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### The Garden Metaphor \n\n[4:12-5:1](../04/12.md) is an extended metaphor. This metaphor is a conversation between the man and the woman he loves in which the man first compares the woman he loves to “a locked garden” (in [4:12-4:15](../04/12.md)) where many delightful things grow and then the woman responds by inviting the man to come to her garden in [4:16](../04/16.md). The man then responds to her invitation in [5:1](../05/1.md). The term **garden** is used as a metaphor for the woman in [4:12](../04/12.md), in [4:16](../04/16.md) (two times), and in [5:1](../05/01.md). You should be consistent in how you translate the term “garden.” In [4:13](../04/13.md) the man speaks of the woman’s body as “an orchard of pomegranate trees with delicious fruits” and then in [4:16](../04/16.md) the woman invites the man to **come to his garden and eat its delicious fruit**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])\n\n### The “sister” metaphor\n\nThe phrase **my sister** is used in 4:9; 4:10, 4:12, 5:1, and 5:2. The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. The woman is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase the same way each of the five times it occurs in this book because the author uses it with the same meaning every time. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in 4:9 for more information regarding this phrase.\n\n

Goats in Israel were black so the original readers would have understood this comparison to mean that the woman’s hair was black. Seen from a distance, a flock of black goats descending down from the high elevation of **Mount Gilead** would have created a majestic visual effect because the goats would have looked like one long flowing mass of black. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly these two points of comparison. Alternate translation: “Your black hair moves in graceful waves like a flock of black goats moving down the slopes of Mount Gilead” or “Your long black hair flows in graceful waves like a flock of black goats coming down the slopes of Mount Gilead” 
4:2	bdg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	שִׁנַּ֨יִ⁠ךְ֙ כְּ⁠עֵ֣דֶר הַ⁠קְּצוּב֔וֹת שֶׁ⁠עָל֖וּ מִן־ הָ⁠רַחְצָ֑ה	1	The color (white) of the woman’s teeth is being compared to the color (white) of sheep after they have had their wool cut off and then washed in the water of a stream. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly these two points of comparison as modeled by the UST.
4:2	cj59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠קְּצוּב֔וֹת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is implied that “shepherds” did it. Alternate translation: “sheep whose wool shepherds have cut off” or “sheep whose wool people have cut off”
4:2	cqgq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַתְאִימ֔וֹת	1	Alternate translation: “give birth to twins”

The author is saying that in a similar way to how twin lambs have a matching sibling that resembles it so each of the woman’s teeth has a matching tooth on the other side of her mouth. She has not lost any of her teeth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. If it would help your readers you could also start a new sentence as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “As a flock of female sheep that has born twin lambs without losing any, so your mouth has its teeth, each with a match, and none of them are missing”
4:2	sb14			וְ⁠שַׁכֻּלָ֖ה אֵ֥ין בָּ⁠הֶֽם	1	Alternate translation: “and there is not one among them which has died” 
4:3	t9kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠ח֤וּט הַ⁠שָּׁנִי֙ שִׂפְתֹתַ֔יִ⁠ךְ	1	**Scarlet** is a term that describes a bright red color. The woman’s lips were a beautiful red color. The woman’s lips are being compared to the color of scarlet thread and not to the thinness of the thread. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Also, if it would help your readers you could use a term for a material that is thicker than **thread** such as ribbon.

4:3	j2a3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠פֶ֤לַח הָֽ⁠רִמּוֹן֙ רַקָּתֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	This comparison could be comparing: (1) the shape of the woman’s **cheeks** to the shape of a **pomegranate** which has been sliced in half and to the outside color of a **pomegranate** (which is the color red). Alternate translation: “Your cheeks are red and rounded like a slice of pomegranate” or “Your cheeks resemble the color and shape of a slice of pomegranate”  (or if you decided that the term **cheek** refers to the woman’s temples “Your temples are red like a slice of pomegranate”) (2) the way the woman’s cheeks looked through the inside of the veil to the color and pattern of the inside of a pomegranate which has been sliced in half. Alternate translation: “Your cheeks resemble the color and pattern of the inside of a slice of pomegranate” (or if you decided that the term **cheeks** refers to the woman’s temples “Your temples are the color of the inside of a slice of pomegranate”)

A long neck was considered beautiful in the author’s culture. King David built some of his towers of beautiful white marble rock. It is probable that this tower was made from white marble rock since this tower is compared to the beauty of the woman’s neck. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “Your neck is long and beautiful like the tower of David” or “Your neck is beautiful like the tower of David” 
4:4	gvns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כְּ⁠מִגְדַּ֤ל דָּוִיד֙	1	The **tower of David** was a tall building that was built for defense. Towers were significantly taller than other buildings and often built more narrow so that they were not wide. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of structure, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “Like the tall, narrow defense structure of David is” or “Like David’s tall thin rock defense building is”

Here, the man compares the beauty of the woman’s neck with **shields** hanging on **the tower of David**. This comparison probably included the decorations of the woman’s necklaces which probably went around her neck many times. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “The beauty of your neck jeweled in necklaces is like a thousand warriors shields hanging from a tower”
4:4	byh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	אֶ֤לֶף	1	In the authors culture the number **a thousand** was often used to represent a very large, but not precise, amount. This is how the number is being used here. Alternate translation: “with many”

Hebrew poetry often used this kind of parallel statement, in which the second line gives additional information, so it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect these two parallel phrases with “each of which” or “each one” in order to show that the second phrase is not repeating the first one, but rather is saying something additional. Alternate translation: “a thousand shields hanging on it, each of which belongs to the warriors” or “a thousand shields hanging on it, each one belonging to the warriors”

The context does not explicitly indicate how exactly the woman’s **two breasts** are like two young gazelles so you could simply say that they resemble young gazelles or if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a general point of comparison between the woman’s **breasts** and the young gazelles such as their beauty as modeled by the UST.

The man is discreetly indicating that the woman’s breasts are pleasant smelling and that he wants to enjoy them (The man and the woman are now married). It would be good to retain this discreet and beautiful poetic imagery if possible. If you are using footnotes you could indicate what these two metaphors mean there. If you decide that it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning using a simile. Alternate translation: “I myself will go to your breasts which are like two sweet-smelling mountains” or “I myself will be close to your breasts, which are like two pleasant smelling hills”

This is poetry and the author is not literally indicating that the woman is physically in the mountains and near wild and dangerous animals. Rather, the author is using this metaphor to express the man’s feelings regarding being physically distant from the woman and his strong desire to have the woman near him and away from anything that could harm her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly using a simile as modeled by the UST.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same general idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine these two phrases into one as modeled by the UST.

4:9	d7n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִבַּבְתִּ֖⁠נִי & לִבַּבְתִּ֨י⁠נִי֙	1	The phrase translated as **you have enchanted my heart** is an idiom which could mean: (1) to steal or capture a person’s heart. In Jewish thinking the **heart** was the center of a persons thinking. To capture a person’s **heart** probably also had the added meaning of causing them to be so in love that they could not think clearly because they were so overcome with feelings of love. Alternate translation: “You have captured my heart … you have captured my heart” or “It is as though you have captured my heart … it is as though you have captured my heart” or “You have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind … you have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind“ (2) the the woman had made the man’s **heart** beat faster. Alternate translation: “You have caused my heart to beat fast … you have caused my heart to beat fast” (3) that the woman had encouraged the man’s **heart**.

4:9	vdf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲחֹתִ֣⁠י	1	The man and woman are not actually brother and sister. The phrase **my sister** is a term of endearment which expresses affection between lovers. This phrase indicates that the man and woman have a close companionship and deep emotional bond. If calling a lover **my sister** would be offensive or socially inappropriate in your culture you could use a different term of endearment or indicate the meaning of **my sister** with a footnote. Alternately, you could indicate the meaning explicitly as modeled by the UST.

4:10	ts8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׁמָנַ֖יִ⁠ךְ	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the words “is better” from the context as modeled by the ULT.

These plants and trees would not normally grow in the same location (garden) because they normally grew in different climates (areas) but because this is poetry the author imaginatively places these plants in one garden to create a poetic comparison for how wonderful the woman he loves is.

The woman then offers her body to the man she loves by inviting him to **come to his garden** (a poetic way of inviting him to come to her and enjoy her body). You should translate the term **garden** here the same way you did in [4:12](../04/12.md) because both uses refer to the woman’s body.

5:intro	kdw4				0	# Song of Songs 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n5:1 The conclusion of the garden metaphor\n\n5:2-8 The theme of longing and searching. \n\n5:9 The women of Jerusalem ask the young women why she thinks the man she loves is special\n\n5:10-16 The woman responds to the question the young women of Jerusalem asked her\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The attractiveness of the man\n\nThe woman describes the man as the epitome of male attractiveness in 5:10-16.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nAs the author has done throughout this book so far, he continues to use metaphors to describe feelings and events that are common to romantic relationships. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Order of events\n\n5:2-8 seems to describe events that would have chronologically and logically occurred before the events described in 3:6-5:1. The solution to this seeming problem is to understand that this book is poetry and that the author is poetically describing emotions and feelings that occur between a man and woman who romantically love each other. Because the author is using poetry to describe the couple’s romantic relationship and its associated feelings, he does not need to follow the conventions of chronological story telling.\n\n### Whether 5:2-8 describes events that really happened or that happened in a dream.\n\nThere are two main views among Bible scholars regarding the events described in 5:2-8. One view is that the events which 5:2-8 describe happened in a dream. The other view is that the events that 5:2-8 describe happened after the man awakened the women from sleeping or from being nearly asleep. The vast majority of Bible scholars think that the first view is correct, that the events described in 5:2-8 happened in a dream.\n\n### The “sister” metaphor\n\nThe phrase **my sister** is used in 4:9; 4:10, 4:12, 5:1, and 5:2. The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. The woman is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase in 5:1, and 5:2 the same way as you translated it in 4:9; 4:10, and 4:12 because the author uses it with the same meaning in this chapter. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in 4:9 for more information regarding this phrase.\n\n### An alternate translation possibility for the word the ULT translates as “towers of” in [5:13](../05/13.md) \n\nIn verse 13, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “towers of.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “yielding.” Consider using that reading in your translation. If “yielding” is used in place of “towers of” then, the first portion of 5:13 in the ULT would read “His cheeks {are} like a bed of spices, yielding herbal spices” (and The UST would read “His cheeks are like a garden where spices grow that produce sweet-smelling perfume”). The phrase “yielding herbal spices” would then be further describing the phrase “a bed of spices.” The point of the comparison would be that the man’s cheeks smell like a garden bed of spices which yields herbal spices. If you choose to use the word “yielding” in your translation you could explain the basis of the comparison for your readers in your translation if you think it would help them. Alternate translation: “His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that produce herbal spices” or “His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that yield herbal spices”

Here the man accepts the woman’s invitation (that she gave in the previous verse) to enjoy her body. The lines **I have plucked my myrrh with my spice** and **I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey** and **I have drunk my wine with my milk** are all metaphors for the man enjoying the woman’s body. If you used similes to translate [4:12-16](../04/12.md) you should continue to do so here. Alternate translation: “You who are as dear to me as a sister, my bride, I am ready to go with you and enjoy the delights of your body, it will be as though I will be gathering myrrh with my other spices, and eating my honey and honeycomb, and drinking my wine and my milk”

He is actually getting ready to do them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, as the UST does, the speakers could be: (1) the “daughters of Jerusalem” who spoke earlier in the book. The daughters of Jerusalem are speaking to the couple at the couple’s wedding. If you are using section headers you can use a phrase such as “The young women of Jerusalem speaking to the couple” or “The young women of Jerusalem speak to the couple at their wedding”  (2) a group of people who are the couple’s friends and wedding guests. If you are using section headers you can use a phrase such as “The couple’s friends speak ” or “The couple’s wedding guests speak” 
5:1	i16q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִכְל֣וּ רֵעִ֔ים שְׁת֥וּ וְ⁠שִׁכְר֖וּ דּוֹדִֽים	1	Eating and drinking are metaphors which are used to represent the newly married couple enjoying their sexual union. The phrase **be drunk** is an encouragement to fully enjoy the delights of their sexual union. If it would help your readers you could express the meaning with a simile. Alternately, you could express the meaning in plain language by adding a describing phrase such as “with love.” If this metaphor of becoming drunk might be offensive to your your hearers you could use a phrase such as “drink deeply” or “drink abundantly” instead of “be drunk.” Alternate translation: “Enjoy your marital intimacy and make love until you are fully satisfied as if you are eating food until full and drinking wine freely” or “Eat, friends; Drink, and be drunk with love” or “Eat, friends; Drink, and drink abundantly of love”
5:2	biy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲנִ֥י יְשֵׁנָ֖ה וְ⁠לִבִּ֣⁠י עֵ֑ר	1	Here, the term **heart** could represent: (1) the woman’s thoughts and mental awareness which would make the phrase **my heart is awake** mean that her mind is alert and dreaming after she had started to sleep. Alternate translation: “I am asleep, but my mind is dreaming” or “I am asleep, but my mind is alert and dreaming” (2) the woman’s entire person which would make the phrase **my heart is awake** mean that she had been awakened after falling **asleep** or awakened after she was almost **asleep**.

However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

These two words are used together to indicate that the man’s skin and complexion looked healthy and handsome. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly that these two words refer to his skin or you could summarize what they indicate when used together as modeled by the UST.

The phrase **refined gold** indicates that the **gold** is very special and valuable. By saying that the man’s **head** is **refined gold** the woman is probably indicating that the man she loves is special and has great worth. If it would help your readers you could use a simile to express the meaning or you could state the meaning plainly.

The woman uses this comparison because **rods of gold** were powerful, had an attractive color, and had a finely rounded shape and **topaz** would have made the **rods of gold** even more nice to look at.  If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His arms are powerful, nicely rounded, and beautiful like rods of gold mounted with topaz”
5:14	r9p1			יָדָי⁠ו֙	1	The word that the ULT translates as **arms** could: (1) refer to **arms** in which case you can use the ULT’s translation as a model. (2) refer to “hands.” Alternate translation: “His hands are” 
5:14	h4kv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠תַּרְשִׁ֑ישׁ	1	**topaz** is a beautiful looking gem stone used in jewelry and also to add decoration to other things. Bible scholars are not certain exactly what stone the word the ULT translates as **topaz** refers to. Many different stones have been proposed such as **topaz**, chrysolite, beryl and others. If you have one of these types of stones in your area you could use it in your translation or you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “with beautiful stones” or “with jewels”

Both **ivory** and **sapphires** are very beautiful. By comparing the man’s **belly** **a plate of ivory covered with sapphires** she is saying that the man’s belly looks beautiful and is probably also trying to indicate the specialness or uniqueness of his appearance since **ivory** and **sapphires** were rare and costly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly.

The woman means that the man’s legs are strong and majestic looking like **pillars of alabaster set on bases of gold**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the meaning with a simile or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His thighs are strong and majestic like pillars of alabaster set on bases of gold”

Both **alabaster** and marble are types of strong stone that are nice looking and are used to make large columns, statues and other things. If your readers would not be familiar with one of these types of stone use the name of the other one. If they are not familiar with either you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “marble” or “stone”

The word **choice** here means “excellent quality” so the phrase **as choice as the cedars** means that the man is of excellent quality like the **cedars** in **Lebanon**. The point of this comparison is that the man is majestic like the mountainous, wooded area of **Lebanon** and is tall and strong and stately like the **cedars**. Also, similar to how the **cedars** are better than other trees so he is outstanding in comparison to other men. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain the point of this comparison or express this meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “His appearance is tall and strong and stately. He is outstanding among other men” or “His appearance is majestic. He is strong and tall and better than other men”

In many cultures today, this can be considered offensive. Different similes of beauty are used in different cultures. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n\n### The meaning of 6:12\n\n6:12 is very difficult to understand and its meaning is uncertain. Bible scholars have a variety of different opinions on the exact meaning of this verse because it is a very difficult verse to interpret and therefore there are a variety of different opinions on how the words and phrases relate to each other and what the exact meaning of some of the words are in context. Published versions of the Bible differ significantly from one another in their rendering of this verse. The ULT seeks to offer a reasonable translation of this verse. But if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may find that it differs from the ULT in the way that it translates this verse. If there is a Bible translation in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the reading of ULT.\n\n\n### The meaning of the phrase “like the dance of two armies” in 6:13\n\nThe meaning of the phrase “like the dance of two armies” is uncertain and Bible scholars have different opinions on the exact meaning of this verse. The ULT offers one possible translation of this verse. But if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may find that it differs from the ULT in the way that it translates this verse. If there is a Bible translation in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the reading of ULT.

If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could express the emphasis in a way that would be natural in your language.

The second line is emphasizing the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words which is common in Hebrew poetry. It would be good to show this repetition to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them.

Because the author does not say who is speaking here you should not indicate who is speaking in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking the speaker could be: (1) the young women of Jerusalem. If you decide this is who is speaking you can follow the example of the UST and indicate this with a section header above this verse. (2) friends of the man and woman. If you decide that this is who is speaking here you can place a section header above this verse indicating that friends of the man and woman are speaking. (3) the man.

7:intro	hqv7				0	# Song of Songs 7 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Beauty\n\nIn 7:1-7 the man describes the woman as the epitome of female beauty and attractiveness using various similes and metaphors. \n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Similes and metaphors\n\nThere are many similes and metaphors in this chapter. Their purpose is to describe the beauty of the woman and to describe romantic love between a man and a woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]]) and (See:[[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### An alternate translation possibility for the word the ULT translates as “love” in [7:6](../07/06.md)\n\nIn verse 6, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “love.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “one who is loved.” Consider using that reading in your translation. If “one who is loved” is used instead of “love” then, the portion of 7:6 that the ULT translates as “love with delights!” would instead be translated “one who is loved, with all your delights!”\n\n\n### An alternate translation possibility for the words that the ULT translates as “the lips of those who sleep” in [7:9](../07/09.md)\n\nIn verse 9, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “the lips of those who sleep.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “lips and teeth.” The translators of the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) thought this and translated this phrase as “my lips and my teeth.” If a Bible translation exists in your region that translates this phrase with the word “teeth” instead of “those who sleep” consider using “lips and teeth” instead of “the lips of those who sleep” in your translation.

The man begins speaking directly to the woman in this verse and continues speaking to her until part way through [7:9](../07/09.md).
7:1	v9et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamation	מַה	1	Here, the word **How** is used as an exclamation to emphasize a statement about how **beautiful** the woman’s **feet** are in **sandals**. Use a natural way in your language to communicate this emphasis.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “The curves of your thighs have an attractive shape, like ornaments that are made by the hands of a craftsman” or “The curves of your thighs are beautiful like the beautiful curves of jewel that a skilled craftsman has made”
7:1	vesl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יְדֵ֥י אָמָּֽן	1	The phrase **the work of the hands of a craftsman** further describes the **ornaments**.

7:1	fc12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יְדֵ֥י אָמָּֽן	1	The man is using one part of a **craftsman**, the **hands**, to represent all of the **craftsman** in the act of making ornaments.

The point of this comparison is that the woman’s **navel** is nicely rounded like a **rounded** wine **bowl**. The phrase **that never lacks spiced wine** describes what is inside the bowl and probably means that in a similar way to how **spiced wine** excites the man and gives him joy so her **navel** excites him and gives him joy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use a simile to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “Your navel is beautifully rounded and causes me to feel excited” or “Your navel is beautifully rounded like a round wine bowl and it causes me to feel excited like drinking spiced wine” or “Your navel is beautifully rounded like a bowl and gives me joy and excitement like when I drink spiced wine”

7:2	l46c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠מָּ֑זֶג	1	The phrase **spiced wine** refers to wine that is mixed with spices.

The point of comparing the woman’s **belly** to **a heap of wheat** is that **wheat** was a very common food in Israel and so was considered nourishing and satisfying to the appetite. The man is expressing that the woman satisfies him. The man is also comparing the color of her **belly** to **wheat** since harvested **wheat** is a pleasant golden beige or tan color. He is also comparing the pleasant shape of her **belly** to the pleasant shape of a **heap of wheat**. The phrase **encircled with the lilies** describes what is around the **heap of wheat** and probably means that in a similar way to how **a heap of wheat encircled with the lilies** looks beautiful so her **belly** is beautiful. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use a simile to express the meaning. Alternate translation: “Your belly is as beautiful as a heap of wheat that is encircled with lilies and it satisfies me” or “The shape and color of your belly is beautiful” or “Your belly is beautiful and satisfying”

The appearance of a **tower** decorated with **ivory** would be beautiful in appearance and tall and slender.  By comparing the woman’s **neck** to a **tower of ivory** the man is saying that the woman’s **neck** is both beautiful and tall and slender. Your language may have a comparable expression for complementing a woman’s neck in this way that you could use in your translation or you could state the basis of the comparison. Alternately, if it would help your readers, you could state the meaning plainly.

Your language may have a comparable expression for complementing a woman’s eyes that you could use in your translation or you could state one or more of these points of comparison or if you have been translating metaphors with similes you could use a simile here.

The man is saying that the woman’s kisses are like **wine** because **wine** is pleasant tasting and has a powerful effect on the body when drunk freely. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “and let your mouth be pleasant tasting and intoxicating like the best wine. May my mouth be like pleasant and intoxicating wine which goes down to my beloved smoothly, gliding over the lips of those who sleep”

Because the author does not say who is speaking here you should not indicate the speaker explicitly in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, as the UST does, you can indicate that the woman is now speaking. (2) continues to be the man. If you decide that the man is still speaking you do not need a header above this portion, but if you are using headers, you will need a header above the next verse indicating that the woman is speaking (since Bible scholars agree that the speaker is the woman beginning in 7:10 and continuing through at least 8:3).

7:9	i415		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠מֵישָׁרִ֑ים דּוֹבֵ֖ב	1	Here, the word **smoothly** means “freely” and refers to freely flowing **wine**.

People in that culture thought that smelling or eating fruit from the mandrake plant would arouse a person’s sexual desire and would help women to conceive children. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of plant, you could use the name of a plant in your area that people think increases sexual desire and/or helps women to conceive children or you could use a more general term. Alternately, you could explain what a mandrake plant is in a footnote. Alternate translation: “The love flowers give off their scent” or “The scent of the love flowers is in the air”

8:intro	d35n				0	# Song of Songs 8 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Strong feelings of love and commitment between a man and woman who love each other romantically\n\n8:6-7 describe the strong feelings of love, commitment, and emotional attachment that can exist between a man and woman who love each other romantically.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n\n### The meaning of [8:12](../08/12.md)\n\nThe three possible meanings of [8:12](../08/12.md) are: (1) that the woman is speaking of herself as a vineyard and saying that her vineyard is hers alone and is comparing herself to Solomon’s vineyard (which was discussed in [8:11](../08/11.md)) and saying that Solomon can keep the profits from his vineyard and his vineyard keepers can keep their portion of the profits from that vineyard. This is the interpretation of the UST. (2) that the woman is speaking of herself as a vineyard and saying that her vineyard is hers alone but that the man who she loves and calls Solomon can freely have the vineyard (her) because she chooses to give herself freely to him. (3) that the man is speaking of the woman he loves as a vineyard and saying that his vineyard (the woman he loves) is his alone and is comparing his vineyard (the woman he loves) to Solomon’s vineyard (which was discussed in [8:11](../08/11.md)) and saying that he feels more wealthy than Solomon because he has the woman he loves as his vineyard and so Solomon can keep the profits from his vineyard and his Solomon’s keepers can keep their portion of the profits from that vineyard.

If it would help your readers, you could an equivalent idiom from your language that expresses a desire or a wish or you could state the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “How I wish that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at the breasts of my mother” or “How I desire that you were like a brother to me, who nursed at the breasts of my mother”

If it would help your readers you could tell your readers in a footnote that the woman desires that the man she loves be **like a brother** to her so that she could show public affection toward him.

The point of comparison between romantic **love** and **death** is that they are both very strong and overcome a person in a powerful and irresistible way. The point of comparison between **Sheol** and the **zeal** of romantic love is that they are both **unyielding**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison from your culture.

8:7	riom		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֶת־הָֽ⁠אַהֲבָ֔ה & בָּ⁠אַהֲבָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea with a verb, as modeled by the UST, or you could express it in some other way that is natural in your language.
8:7	jwh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	אִם־יִתֵּ֨ן אִ֜ישׁ אֶת־כָּל־ה֤וֹן בֵּית⁠וֹ֙ בָּ⁠אַהֲבָ֔ה בּ֖וֹז יָב֥וּזוּ לֽ⁠וֹ	1	The woman speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but she means that it must be true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, then you could translate the woman’s words as an affirmative statement.  Alternate translation: “Even though a man tries to give all the wealth of his house in exchange for love, his offer will be utterly despised”\n
8:7	n3pn			בָּ⁠אַהֲבָ֔ה	1	Alternate translation: “in order to get love” or “in order to buy love”
8:7	bir4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֽ⁠וֹ	1	The word the ULT translates as **it** could: (1) refer to **all the wealth of his house** and be translated as “it” as modeled by the ULT.

8:8-9	qj9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	אָח֥וֹת לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ קְטַנָּ֔ה וְ⁠שָׁדַ֖יִם אֵ֣ין לָ֑⁠הּ מַֽה־נַּעֲשֶׂה֙ לַ⁠אֲחֹתֵ֔⁠נוּ בַּ⁠יּ֖וֹם שֶׁ⁠יְּדֻבַּר־בָּֽ⁠הּ & אִם־חוֹמָ֣ה הִ֔יא נִבְנֶ֥ה עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ טִ֣ירַת כָּ֑סֶף וְ⁠אִם־דֶּ֣לֶת הִ֔יא נָצ֥וּר עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ ל֥וּחַ אָֽרֶז	1	The author does not say who is speaking here so you should not indicate who you think is speaking explicitly in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, the majority of Bible scholars think that the woman’s brothers are speaking here. Because of this and because the phrases **A sister belongs to us** and **What will we do with our sister** in 8:8 seem to indicate that the woman’s brothers are speaking, the most likely view is that her brothers are the the ones speaking so if you choose to use headers you can place a header above 8:8-9, indicating that the woman’s brothers are speaking as modeled by the UST.
8:8	au5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קְטַנָּ֔ה	1	Here, the phrase **a little one** means “a young one” or “a younger one.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a young one” or “a younger one”
8:8	ada0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠שָׁדַ֖יִם אֵ֣ין לָ֑⁠הּ	1	The phrase **and breasts there are not for her** is an idiom expressing that the woman’s brothers think she is not yet ready for marriage and meaning that her breasts are small and have not fully formed (and are therefore small) indicating that she has not reached full physical maturity. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “and she is not yet fully grown” or “and her breasts are still small” or “and she is not yet ready for marriage” 
8:8	t9yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בַּ⁠יּ֖וֹם	1	The phrase **on the day** is an idiom meaning “at the time.” If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language as modeled by the UST. 
8:8	tzso		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠יּ֖וֹם שֶׁ⁠יְּדֻבַּר־בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	The phrase **the day when it is spoken for her** means “on the day when she is spoken for in marriage” and betrothed to a man. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the day when she is pledged to be married” or “on the day when she is spoken for in marriage” or “on the day when she is betrothed to be married”
8:8	rs4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שֶׁ⁠יְּדֻבַּר־בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context implies that the brothers are the ones who will do it. Alternate translation: “when we speak for her by promising a man that he can marry her” 
8:9	mpf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־חוֹמָ֣ה הִ֔יא נִבְנֶ֥ה עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ טִ֣ירַת כָּ֑סֶף	1	Here, the woman’s brothers are speaking of their sister as if she were **a wall** that they would **build...a battlement of silver** upon. The meaning of this metaphor could be: (1) that they would makes effort to protect her virginity as if she were **a wall** that they were seeking to protect by building a silver battlement on (a battlement was a row of stones that was built on top of a wall for the purpose of protecting it). Alternate translation: “We will protect her virginity like how we would protect a wall by building a battlement of silver on it” (2) that her chest was flat like a wall because her breasts were not yet fully formed and so they would try to make her more attractive for the man she was going to marry by adorning her with silver jewels. Alternate translation: “If her chest is flat like a wall, we will decorate it by putting silver jewels that are like towers on it” 
8:9	durb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אִם־דֶּ֣לֶת הִ֔יא נָצ֥וּר עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ ל֥וּחַ אָֽרֶז	1	Here, the woman’s brothers are speaking of their sister as if she were **a door** that they would **enclose** with **boards of cedar**. The meaning of this metaphor could be: (1) that they would makes effort to protect her virginity as if she were **a door** that they would **enclose** with **boards of cedar**. Alternate translation: “We will protect her virginity like how we would enclose a door with boards of cedar” (2) that her chest was flat like a door because her breasts were not yet fully formed and so they would try to make her more attractive for the man she was going to marry by adorning her like how they would decorate a door with cedar wood (The word the ULT translates as **enclose** is identical in form to another word which means “decorate” so it is possible that “decorate” could be the intended meaning here). Alternate translation: “And if she is flat like a door, we will decorate her like how we would decorate a door with planks of cedar wood”

However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, as the UST does, you can place a header above 8:10 indicating that the speaker is the woman.
8:10	n2vy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲנִ֣י חוֹמָ֔ה	1	Here, the woman continues the metaphor of a wall that her brothers began in the preceding verse. By referring to herself as **a wall** here, she could: (1) be indicating that she had remained a virgin. Alternate translation: “I was like a wall and remained a virgin” (2) be referring to her chest and be saying that in the past her breasts were not fully formed. Alternate translation: “My chest was previously flat like a wall” 
8:10	r3ez			וְ⁠שָׁדַ֖⁠י	1	Alternate translation: “but now my breasts are” 
8:10	mc78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠שָׁדַ֖⁠י כַּ⁠מִּגְדָּל֑וֹת	1	The point of this comparison is that the woman’s breasts are large **like towers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the point of this comparison or you could express this meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “and now my breasts are large” or “and now my breasts are fully grown”  
8:10	jdgq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אָ֛ז	1	The word translated as **then** indicates that what follows is a result of what came before it.

8:10	vs14			כְּ⁠מוֹצְאֵ֥ת	1	The word the ULT translates as **finds** could mean: (1) “finds.” If you choose this option you should translate this word in a similar way to the ULT. (2) “brings.” Alternate translation: “like a person who brings”
8:10	b5uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָיִ֥יתִי בְ⁠עֵינָ֖י⁠ו כְּ⁠מוֹצְאֵ֥ת שָׁלֽוֹם	1	Here, the word **peace** refers to “favor.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I found favor in his eyes”

However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking the speaker could be: (1) the woman in both 8:11 and 8:12. If you decide that the woman is speaking in these verses you can follow the example of the UST and include these two verses under the section heading for 8:10 that indicates the woman is speaking. (2) the man in both these verses. If you decide the man is speaking in these verses you can put a section header at the top of 8:11 indicating that the man is speaking.
8:11	x2c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠בַ֣עַל הָמ֔וֹן	1	**Baal Hamon** is the name of a place. The name **Baal Hamon** means “master of wealth.” Because the meaning of the name has significance here you could include a footnote in your translation indicating that the name  **Baal Hamon** means “master of wealth, wealthy master, possessor of abundance.” 
8:11	b1b3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לַ⁠נֹּטְרִ֑ים	1	Here, the term **keepers** refers to farmers who rent land from a land owner and pay the land owner in order to farm his land (Here, the amount the **keepers** payed **Solomon** the land owner to farm his land was **a thousand pieces of silver**). If your readers would not be familiar with this type of farmer, you could describe what this term means in your translation. Alternate translation: “people who would pay him so that they could farm it” or “men who would pay him so that they could farm it” 
8:11	mz3u			נָתַ֥ן אֶת־הַ⁠כֶּ֖רֶם לַ⁠נֹּטְרִ֑ים	1	Alternate translation: “He rented the vineyard to keepers” or “He leased the vineyard to keepers" or “He agreed to let keepers pay him so they could grow grapes in the vineyard”

8:12	za66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כָּרְמִ֥⁠י	1	Here, the phrase **My vineyard** is a metaphor (see the section on [8:12](../08/12.md) in the chapter intro for the meaning of this entire verse). Here, the phrase **My vineyard** could be: (1) the woman referring to herself as a **vineyard**, as she did in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “I am like a vineyard” or “My body is like a vineyard” (2) the man referring to the woman he loves as if she were his **vineyard**. Alternate translation: “The woman who I love is like my vineyard” or “The woman who I love is like a vineyard”
8:12	gc75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠פָנָ֑⁠י	1	The phrase **is before me** means “is mine to give.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

8:12	m0qa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	הָ⁠אֶ֤לֶף לְ⁠ךָ֙ שְׁלֹמֹ֔ה	1	Here, the woman could be: (1) speaking as if **Solomon** is present with her even though he is not in order to use him as an example. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate these words in a way that does not make it seem like the woman is speaking directly to **Solomon** but rather indicates that she is speaking about **Solomon**. Alternate translation: “The thousand belong to Solomon” (2) calling the man she loves by the name **Solomon** (even though he was not Solomon) as term of endearment similar to how she called the man she loved “The king” in [1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: “The thousand belong to you, the man I love, you who are like king Solomon” or “The thousand belong to you, the man I love, you who I call Solomon”

However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, as the UST does, you can place a header above this section indicating that the man is speaking.
8:13	em85			חֲבֵרִ֛ים	1	Here, the term **companions** is masculine in form in the original language and most likely refers to the man’s friends who were shepherds and were mentioned in [1:7](../01/07.md). See how you translated the term **companions** in [1:7](../01/07.md).
8:13	zm5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠קוֹלֵ֖⁠ךְ	1	Here, the word **voice** could: (1) represent the woman’s speech (the words she says). Alternate translation: “to hear you speak” (2) refer to the sound of the woman’s voice. Alternate translation: “to hear your voice”

8:14	mqx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַ֖ל הָרֵ֥י בְשָׂמִֽים	1	The phrase **the mountains of spices** has a double meaning. The literal meaning refers to **mountains** where **spices** grow. The metaphorical meaning is that the woman herself is the **mountains** where **spices** grow and she wants the man she loves to come to her and enjoy her body. If it would help your readers, you could indicate the metaphorical meaning in a footnote.
