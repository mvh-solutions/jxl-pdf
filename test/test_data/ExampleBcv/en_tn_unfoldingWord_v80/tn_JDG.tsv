History of the judges of Israel (1:1–16:31)\n    * Introduction (1:1–3:6)\n    * Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar (3:7–31)\n    * Deborah and Barak (4:1–5:31)\n    * Gideon (6:1–8:35)\n    * Abimelech, Tola, and Jair (9:1–10:5)\n    * Jephthah (10:6–12:7)\n    * Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15)\n    * Samson (13:1–16:31)\n1. The account of Micah and his idols (17:1–18:31)\n1. The account of Gibeah; the other Israelites take revenge (19:1–21:25)\n\n### What is the Book of Judges about?\n\nThe Book of Judges tells of events that occurred after the Israelites settled in the Promised Land. The events in this book happened over a period of about 150 years.\n\nThis book describes how the Israelites repeatedly sinned against Yahweh during this time. They worshiped false gods and did the same wicked things as the peoples who lived around them. Therefore, God would allow enemies to defeat and oppress the Israelites. Eventually, the Israelites would call to Yahweh for help. Yahweh would then cause someone to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. This person was called a “judge.” The Israelites would live in peace until the judge died.\n\nAfter that judge died, the Israelites would start sinning again. So this pattern of events would repeat.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has the title “Judges” because it gives accounts of some of the main leaders or judges in Israel before there were any kings over the people. Unless there are good reasons for following the title in other Bible versions, the translator should probably use the title “Judges” or a title such as “The Book about the Leaders in Israel.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What kind of leaders were the judges?\n\nThese were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. After defeating their enemies, these leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of these leaders may have served only certain tribes.\n\n### What kind of society was Israel during the time of the judges?\n\nDuring this time, the twelve tribes of Israel were independent of one another. They were not a unified nation with one ruler. The tribes would sometimes help each other when enemies were threatening them.\n\nThese tribes were descended from the same ancestors: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They shared in the same covenant with Yahweh.\n\n### What spiritual struggles did Israel experience during the time of the judges?\n\nDuring this time, Israel struggled to remain faithful to Yahweh. The best judges encouraged Israel to be faithful to him, but some of the judges failed to do so. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n
1:intro	a4am				0	# Judges 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### “After the death of Joshua”\nThis statement creates a seamless transition from the book of Joshua.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Finishing the conquest of the Promised Land\n\nIsrael fought to clear the land of the Canaanites, but they also made treaties with other peoples and made some of them do hard labor. This was against God’s instruction to completely remove the Canaanite people from the land.

This is why they refused to help Gideon. By allying themselves with the Midianites, they aligned themselves against Yahweh. Because of this, Gideon treated them like he treated the Midianites. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Gideon refuses to be king\n\nGideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, neither will my son rule over you. Yahweh will rule over you.” Although the book of Deuteronomy anticipates a king in Israel, it was sinful for Israel to desire to have a king. He did though take a share of everyone’s plunder as a king would have done through taxes. This may serve as a warning to Israel about their desire to have a king.
