Final remarks\n    * Values (4:8–9)\n    * Contentment (4:10–20)\n    * Final Greetings (4:21–23)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Philippians?\n\nPaul wrote Philippians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome.\n\n### What is the book of Philippians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the believers in Philippi, a city in Macedonia. He wrote it to thank the Philippians for the gift they had sent him. He wanted to tell them how he was doing in prison and to encourage them to rejoice, even if they were suffering. He also wrote to them about a man named Epaphroditus, the one who brought the gift to Paul. While visiting Paul, Epaphroditus became ill, so Paul decided to send him back to Philippi. Paul encouraged the believers in Philippi to welcome him and to be kind to Epaphroditus when he returned.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philippians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Philippi,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Philippi.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the city of Philippi like?\n\nPhilip, the father of Alexander the Great, founded Philippi in the region of Macedonia. This meant that the citizens of Philippi were also considered citizens of Rome. The people of Philippi were proud of being citizens of Rome. But Paul tells the believers that it is much more important that they are citizens of heaven (3:20).\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The words “you” and “your” always refer to the believers in Philippi, except for one time in 4:3. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### Who were the “enemies of the cross of Christ” (3:18) in this letter?\n\nThe “enemies of the cross of Christ” were probably people who called themselves believers, but they did not obey God’s commands. They thought that freedom in Christ meant that believers could do whatever they desired, and God would not punish them (3:19).\n\n### Why were the words “joy” and “rejoice” frequently used in this letter?\n\nPaul was in prison when he wrote this letter (1:7). Even though he suffered, Paul said many times that he was joyful because God had been kind to him through Jesus Christ. He wanted to encourage his readers to have the same trust in Jesus Christ.\n\n### What does Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” or “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nThese kinds of expressions occur in 1:1, 8, 13, 14, 26, 27; 2:1, 5, 19, 24, 29; 3:1, 3, 9, 14; 4:1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 19, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Philippians?\n\nSome versions have “Amen” at the end of the final verse in the letter (4:23). The ULT, UST, and some modern versions include it, but many other versions do not. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	kd3g				0	# Philippians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nPaul follows the normal practice of the time by beginning the letter with a statement of the names of the senders and the recipients. In that culture, the sender would then offer a good wish for the recipients. Paul does this in the form of a Christian blessing.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The day of Christ\n\nThis refers to the day when Christ returns. Paul often connected the return of Christ with motivating godly living. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This statement in verse 21 is a paradox: “to die is gain.” In verse 23 Paul explains why this is true. ([Philippians 1:21](../../php/01/21.md))
1:1	bzfs			ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “in union with Christ Jesus”
1:2	uuep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	This is a greeting and blessing that Paul often uses in the beginning of his letters. Use a form in your language that makes it clear that this is a greeting and blessing. Alternate translation: “may you experience kindness, mercy, and peace within you” or “I pray that you will have grace, mercy, and peace”
1:2	pyji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1	Here, **you** refers to the Philippian Christians and is plural in form in the original language in which Paul wrote. Throughout this letter, with one exception, the words “you” and “your” are plural and refer to the Philippian Christians. If your language uses different forms to show when “you” and “your” refer to one person and when they refer to more than one person, use the plural form that would be appropriate in your language in this occurrence and all other occurrences of “you” and “your” in this letter, except for in [4:3](../04/03.md). A note will discuss the one exception in [4:3](../04/03.md).
1:2	yh4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1	If your language has different forms for including or excluding the hearers, use the inclusive form for **our** here and throughout the letter.
1:3	ntp5			ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ μνείᾳ ὑμῶν	1	Here, **in all my remembrance of you** could refer to: (1) each time that Paul thought about the Philippian believers. Alternate translation: “each time that I think about you” (2) each time that Paul prayed for the Philippian believers. Alternate translation: “every time that I pray for you”
1:3	gjyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῷ Θεῷ μου	1	Use of the words **my God** does not mean that God belongs to Paul, but that Paul belongs to God. That is, God is the one whom Paul worships exclusively. Alternate translation: “the one who is God to me”
1:3	w8dz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῶν	1	See how you translated the word **you** in [1:2](../01/02.md). In this letter, every use of the words **you** and **your** is plural and refers to the Philippian believers, except for one use in [4:3](../04/03.md), which has a note to discuss it.

1:5	fdqe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῶν	1	Here, the word **your** is plural and refers to the Philippian Christians. In this letter, with one exception, the words “you” and “your” are always plural and always refer to the Philippian Christians.

A note will discuss the one exception in [4:3](../04/03.md).
1:5	yi9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ κοινωνίᾳ ὑμῶν εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	1	Here, **your fellowship in the gospel** refers to the Philippians’ partnering with Paul in the various things involved in spreading the gospel. This includes gifts of money that they sent to Paul (See: [4:15–18](../04/15.md)). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this more explicitly. Alternate translation: “your participation with me in advancing the gospel” or “your partnership with me in working to spread the good news about Jesus”
1:5	vi1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τῆς πρώτης ἡμέρας	1	The phrase **from the first day** refers to the time at which the Philippian believers first believed the gospel that Paul preached to them. This may also have been the first day that Paul preached in Philippi. Alternate translation: “from the time you first heard and believed the gospel that I preached”
1:5	d8hi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄχρι τοῦ νῦν	1	The phrase **until now** does not mean that the Philippian believers have now stopped partnering with Paul. Rather, it means that they are still partnering with Paul. Alternate translation: “that we are still sharing now”
1:6	s1l8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πεποιθὼς αὐτὸ τοῦτο	1	The phrase **having been persuaded** indicates a reason that Paul thanks God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I thank God because I am confident of this very thing”
1:6	jf4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐναρξάμενος ἐν ὑμῖν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν, ἐπιτελέσει	1	Here, **the one** refers to God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that God, having begun a good work in you, will perfect it”
1:6	u80a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι ὁ ἐναρξάμενος ἐν ὑμῖν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν	1	The phrase **a good work in you** refers to both the initial conversion of the Philippian Christians and to God’s ongoing work in their lives through the Holy Spirit. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “that God, having begun his good work in you through your conversion and continuing it through the work of the Holy Spirit”
1:6	qhmh			ὑμῖν	1	See how you translated the word **you** in [Philippians 1:2](../01/02.md).
1:6	p2a5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιτελέσει	1	Here, **will perfect {it}** means that God would bring to completion the work which he began in the lives of the Philippian believers at their conversion and which he was continuing to do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this explicitly.
1:6	p5pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡμέρας Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	The phrase **the day of Jesus Christ** refers to the time in the future when Jesus Christ will return to judge the world and save those who believe in him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the time when Jesus Christ returns”
1:7	sowf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ ἔχειν με ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμᾶς	1	The phrase, **I have you in my heart** is an idiom which expresses strong affection. If you have an equivalent expression which adequately communicates the meaning, you may use it here. If not, you could state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “I love you very much”
1:7	jn2s			συνκοινωνούς μου τῆς χάριτος & ὄντας	1	Alternate translation: “sharing in grace with me”
1:7	df00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάριτος	1	Here, **grace** refers to the way that God kindly gives us good things that we do not deserve. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **grace** with a verb or adjective. In this context, Paul considers both his imprisonment and his ministry of defending and confirming the gospel to be gifts from God. Alternate translation: “of God’s gracious gift” or “in experiencing how kind God is”
1:7	o7ef		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	δεσμοῖς μου	1	Paul refers to his imprisonment in Rome by using the phrase **my chains**. Paul was chained to a guard and the Philippian Christians would have understood that Paul was referring to his imprisonment when he used the phrase **my chains** because of the close association between **chains** and being in prison. If this association is not clear in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “my imprisonment”
1:7	wey7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀπολογίᾳ καὶ βεβαιώσει τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	The words translated **defense** and **confirmation** could be used to refer to defending and confirming in a court of law the truth of something against which a charge was made. These two words mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize that this is hard work. If your language has one word for these ideas, use that here and add emphasis another way. If there is a word or phrase that could be used with this legal sense but could also be used in the context of defending the gospel, consider using it here. Alternate translation: “and as I contend for the truth of the gospel” or “and as I labor to show people that the gospel is true”
1:8	xun1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	The Greek word translated as **inner parts** is a term which refers to body organs, particularly to the intestines, liver, lungs, and heart. Paul is using **inner parts** to refer to love or affection. You can use the body part that represents the seat of affection in your language, or translate the plain meaning. Alternate translation: “with the heart of Christ Jesus” or “with the affection of Christ Jesus”
1:8	bo0r			ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, **the inner parts of Christ Jesus** could mean: (1) the same kind of love as Christ Jesus gives to people. (2) love that originates with Christ Jesus. Alternate translation: “with love that comes from Christ Jesus”
1:9	jlyu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἵνα ἡ ἀγάπη ὑμῶν ἔτι μᾶλλον καὶ μᾶλλον περισσεύῃ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **love** with the verb form. Alternate translation: “that you will be able to love others more and more abundantly”
1:9	f4q5			ὑμῶν	1	See how you translated the word **your** in [Philippians 1:5](../01/05.md).
1:9	tbtt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἐπιγνώσει καὶ πάσῃ αἰσθήσει	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **knowledge** and **understanding** with verb phrases. Alternate translation: “and that God will enable you to see the truth about Him and teach you to love wisely”
1:10	e17g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν ὑμᾶς τὰ διαφέροντα	1	The word **{what}** here refers to that which a person does, and the word **excels** here refers to something that is best, according to God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that you may approve and choose to do what pleases God the most”
1:10	ybw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰς	1	Here, the phrase **so that** shows that what follows this phrase is the desired result of Paul’s prayer in verse nine. Consider using a connecting word or phrase that will clearly show that what follows it is the desired result of what Paul prayed in verse nine.
1:10	siv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	εἰλικρινεῖς καὶ ἀπρόσκοποι	1	The words **pure** and **blameless** have very similar meanings. Paul uses these two words together to emphasize the idea of moral purity. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these two words and translate them as one idea. Alternate translation: “completely innocent”
1:11	lu5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πεπληρωμένοι καρπὸν δικαιοσύνης τὸν	1	Here, the phrase **being filled with** is a metaphor meaning to be occupied in doing something. The phrase **the fruit of righteousness** is a metaphor which refers to what characterizes a person, namely what a person produces. This metaphor is a comparison between a good tree that produces good fruit and a person who is filled with righteousness and produces good actions as a result. So with these two metaphors, Paul is telling the Philippians to be occupied in doing righteous deeds. If this would be unclear in your language, you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “filling your lives with the righteous deeds that are” or “habitually doing the good works that are”
1:11	t3w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πεπληρωμένοι	1	The phrase **being filled with** is a passive form. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “letting God fill you with” or “continually producing”
1:11	yq99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **through Christ Jesus** is a metaphor meaning that Christ Jesus is the one who makes it possible for a person to be righteous and thus to do the things that a righteous person does. Alternate translation: “that Christ Jesus produces in you” or “that Christ Jesus enables you to produce”
1:11	jwgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς δόξαν καὶ ἔπαινον Θεοῦ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **glory** and **praise** with verbs. Alternate translation: “which will cause people to glorify and praise God”
1:11	mfs6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	εἰς δόξαν καὶ ἔπαινον Θεοῦ	1	The words **glory** and **praise** mean very similar things here. They are used together to emphasize how much people will praise God. If you have one word for this in your language, you could use it here and show emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “which will cause people to greatly praise God” or “which will cause people to declare how great God is”
1:12	tu2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a spiritual sense to include both men and women who believe in Jesus. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters”
1:12	ygt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** here to refer to anyone who is a fellow believer in Jesus. If this is not clear in your language, you could express this plainly. Alternative translation, “my companions who believe in Jesus”
1:12	zy4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ	1	The phrase **the things concerning me** refers to Paul’s imprisonment. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the things I have suffered because I was put into prison for preaching about Jesus”
1:12	q288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μᾶλλον εἰς προκοπὴν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου ἐλήλυθεν	1	The phrase **advancement of the gospel** refers to an increasing number of people hearing and believing the gospel. Alternate translation: “have actually caused more people to hear the gospel”
1:13	wi6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the phrase **As a result** shows that what follows this phrase is the result of Paul’s circumstances which he began discussing in verse 12, namely, his imprisonment. Consider using a connecting word or phrase that will clearly show that what follows it is the result of Paul’s imprisonment.
1:13	h1ly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	δεσμούς μου	1	Paul again refers to his imprisonment in a figurative way by using the phrase **my chains**. See how you translated this phrase in [1:7](../01/07.md).
1:13	f8az		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς δεσμούς μου & ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here, the phrase **my chains in Christ** means that Paul is imprisoned because of his work for the cause of Christ. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “my chains for the sake of Christ” or “my chains because I teach people about Christ” or “my chains for the cause of Christ”
1:14	a1kh			τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	See how you translated **brothers** in the previous verse [1:12](../01/12.md).
1:14	eurs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** here to refer to anyone who is a fellow believer in Jesus. If this is not clear in your language, you could express this plainly. Alternative translation, “my companions who believe in Jesus”
1:14	sz29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ πεποιθότας τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου	1	The phrase **encouraged in the Lord** means that the Philippian Christians had grown in their trust of the Lord because of Paul’s imprisonment. Alternate translation: “trust the Lord more because of my chains” or “have received more courage from the Lord as a result of my imprisonment”
1:14	k4tm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ τοὺς πλείονας τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἐν Κυρίῳ πεποιθότας τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who or what caused the action. Alternate translation: “The Lord has encouraged most of the brothers because of my chains” or “My chains have given most of the brothers more trust in the Lord”
1:14	ecy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	δεσμοῖς μου	1	Paul is referring to his imprisonment by mentioning one part of it: the chains that bound his feet and hands. If this is unclear in your language, you could mention the imprisonment directly. See how you translated the phrase **my chains** in [1:7](../01/07.md) and [1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: “because of my imprisonment”
1:14	v2wo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, **the word** refers to the message from God about Jesus. If it would be clearer in your language, consider stating this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the gospel” or “the good news” or “God’s message”
1:15	sa9n			Some indeed even proclaim Christ	0	Beginning in this verse, and extending to the end of [1:17](../01/17.md), Paul uses a poetic device called chiasm that could be confusing in some languages. You may need to reorder certain things in [1:15–17](../01/15.md) if it would be more natural in your language. See the UST.
1:15	vw1s			τινὲς μὲν καὶ & τὸν Χριστὸν κηρύσσουσιν	1	Alternate translation: “Some people are preaching the good news about Jesus”
1:15	z9y9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ φθόνον καὶ ἔριν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **envy** and **strife** by using them in a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “because they are envious and seek their own evil purposes”
1:15	yh1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εὐδοκίαν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **goodwill** by using it in a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “their desire that others would know Jesus Christ”
1:16	w0b8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξ ἀγάπης	1	Here the object of the word **love** is not specified. You can leave the object of **love** unspecified or, if it is needed in your language, you may specify the object of **love**. Here, the word **love** could refer to: (1) love for Paul. Alternate translation: “because of their love for me” (2) love for Christ. Alternate translation: “The ones who proclaim the good news because they love Christ” (3) love for multiple objects, such as Paul and Christ and those who have not yet heard or believed in the gospel. Alternate translation: “The ones who proclaim the good news because of their love for me, and Jesus, and those who do not believe”
1:16	ttr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κεῖμαι	1	You could state the phrase **I am appointed** in active form. Alternate translation: “God appointed me”
1:16	st7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς ἀπολογίαν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	Paul is speaking of the gospel as though it were a place or person that could be attacked. If this is confusing in your language, you can use plain language. See how you translated “defense and confirmation of the gospel” in [1:7](../01/07.md). Alternate translation: “to prove that the message about Jesus is true”
1:16	ia9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς ἀπολογίαν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου κεῖμαι	1	The phrase **I am appointed** could refer to: (1) God appointing Paul’s current situation of being in prison. Alternate translation: “I am assigned to be here for the defense of the gospel” (2) God appointing Paul to the ministry of defending the gospel. Alternate translation: “God has delegated me to the ministry of publicly defending the truth of the good news”
1:16	vnfl			ἀπολογίαν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	See how you translated the phrase “defense and confirmation of the gospel” in [1:7](../01/07.md).
1:17	sgss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἱ δὲ ἐξ ἐριθείας τὸν Χριστὸν καταγγέλλουσιν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **ambition** with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “but they proclaim Christ only to make themselves seem important”
1:17	j333			οὐχ ἁγνῶς	1	Alternate translation: “with wrong motives” or “from wrong motives”
1:17	z8ty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου	1	Paul is referring to his imprisonment by mentioning one part of it: the chains that bound his feet and hands. If this is unclear in your language, you could mention the imprisonment directly. See how you translated the phrase **my chains** in [1:7](../01/07.md) and [1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: “because of my imprisonment”
1:17	tc1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἰόμενοι θλῖψιν ἐγείρειν τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could state how the selfish preachers suppose that they are causing trouble to Paul. You could also start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They hope to cause me trouble in my imprisonment by their preaching”
1:18	dc7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί γάρ	1	The phrase **What then?** is a rhetorical question. If using a rhetorical question would be confusing in your language, consider expressing the meaning of this rhetorical question by changing it into a statement. Alternate translation: “But that does not matter!”
1:18	z5ia		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τί γάρ	1	In the rhetorical question **What then?**, Paul leaves out some words that might be necessary in some languages. If you want to use a rhetorical question here, you may want to add the words which are implied but not stated. This could be done in two ways: (1) as a rhetorical question which expects a negative answer. Alternate translation: “What does it matter what their motives are?” or “So what difference does it make?” (2) as a phrase that focuses on the result. Alternate translation: “What then is the result of this?”
1:18	sw24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Χριστὸς καταγγέλλεται	1	You can express the meaning of the passive form **is proclaimed** with an active form. Alternate translation: “we all proclaim Christ”
1:19	saze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτό	1	Here, the word **this** refers to Paul’s current situation of being in prison and the things that accompanied it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “my imprisonment” or “my current condition in prison”

He says that if they live out what he has just told them, then when Christ returns, he can be proud of the fact that he did not work in vain among them. Consider the best way in your language to show this reason-result relationship. Alternate translation: “so that I will be able to boast on the day Christ returns that I did not run in vain or labor in vain”
2:16	esvd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς καύχημα ἐμοὶ	1	Here, **boasting** refers to Paul being rightfully proud of God’s work in the lives of the Philippian believers.

2:16	m1z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ εἰς κενὸν ἔδραμον	1	Here Paul uses the word **run** metaphorically to mean “work.” Here Paul specifically means that he worked for the advancement of the gospel among the Philippians. Paul uses the word **run** to bring to the Philippians’ minds the image of a runner who is racing toward a finish line in order to win a prize. If this image is familiar to people in your culture, consider using this metaphor. But if this image is not familiar to your readers, consider stating this idea in plain language.

2:17	p9km		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ	1	**But even if** connects the idea of running and laboring for the advance of the gospel, which Paul discussed in [2:16](../02/16.md), with what he says in the rest of this verse.

A priest would sacrifice an animal on the altar as a burnt offering to God and then pour out wine as a drink offering to God, in order to make the sacrifice complete. See [Num 28:7](../num/28/07.md). If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, consider using it here, but if this imagery would be confusing in your culture, consider translating this imagery using plain language.

2:25	c3ce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνστρατιώτην	1	Here the phrase **fellow soldier** does not mean that Epaphroditus and Paul were actual soldiers in a military. What Paul means is that he and Epaphroditus were spiritual soldiers fighting together beside God in the spiritual battle against Satan and evil. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this explicitly or modify the phrase **fellow soldier** to further explain what Paul means, or you could express the meaning of **fellow soldier** by turning it into a simile, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “fellow believer who works and struggles along with us” or “fellow soldier of God” or “fellow warrior for God”
2:25	qsd6			ὑμῶν & ἀπόστολον καὶ λειτουργὸν τῆς χρείας μου	1	Alternate translation: “who brings your messages to me and helps me in my need”

2:26	wdvh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπειδὴ ἐπιποθῶν ἦν πάντας ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἀδημονῶν διότι ἠκούσατε ὅτι ἠσθένησεν	1	In this verse all three uses of the pronoun **he** refer to Epaphroditus. If it would be helpful in your language, consider clarifying this in your translation in a way that would be natural. Alternate translation: “seeing that Epaphroditus has been longing to be with you all and is distressed because you heard that he was sick”
2:27	d3ou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ γὰρ ἠσθένησεν παραπλήσιον θανάτῳ, ἀλλὰ ὁ Θεὸς ἠλέησεν αὐτόν, οὐκ αὐτὸν δὲ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐμέ, ἵνα μὴ λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην σχῶ	1	Here the pronoun **he** refers to Epaphroditus, as do both uses of the pronoun **him**. If this would be unclear in your language, consider clarifying this in your translation. Alternate translation: “For indeed Epaphroditus was sick nearly to death. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow”
2:27	rl0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἠσθένησεν παραπλήσιον θανάτῳ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **death** with an adjective such as “dying” or with a verbal form such as **died**, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “he was sick nearly to the point of dying”
2:27	n0zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀλλὰ ὁ Θεὸς ἠλέησεν αὐτόν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **mercy**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **mercy** with an adjective such as “merciful” or in some other way. Alternate translation: “but God was merciful to him”
2:27	ioqq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην	1	If it would be helpful in your language, consider using an equivalent expression for **sorrow upon sorrow**, or state the meaning of this phrase explicitly. Alternate translation: “sorrow added to sorrow”
2:27	dzgz			λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην	1	The expression **sorrow upon sorrow** could mean: (1) adding the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death to the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ sickness. Alternate translation: “the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death added to the sorrow of his sickness” (2) adding the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death to the sorrow of Paul’s imprisonment. Alternate translation: “the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death added to the sorrow of my imprisonment”
2:28	kt1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	σπουδαιοτέρως οὖν ἔπεμψα αὐτὸν, ἵνα ἰδόντες αὐτὸν πάλιν, χαρῆτε κἀγὼ ἀλυπότερος ὦ	1	Here, both occurrences of the pronoun **him** refer to Epaphroditus. If it would be helpful in your language, consider clarifying who **him** is referring to in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Therefore, I sent Epaphroditus all the more eagerly, so that, having seen him again, you might rejoice, and I might be free from pain”
2:28	y5gc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κἀγὼ ἀλυπότερος ὦ	1	Here when Paul refers to **pain**, he is referring to emotional pain. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **pain**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **pain** with an adjective such as “anxious” or “concerned” or in some other way. Alternate translation: “and I might be less anxious” or “and I might be less concerned about you”
2:29	y95x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	προσδέχεσθε & αὐτὸν	1	The word **welcome** is a command or instruction in plural form to all of the Philippian Christians. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort all of you to welcome him” or “all of you receive him”
2:29	qx14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν Κυρίῳ μετὰ πάσης χαρᾶς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **joy** with an adverb such as “joyfully,” as the UST does, or you can use a verbal form of this word such as “rejoicing.” Alternate translation: “Therefore, welcome him in the Lord with rejoicing”
2:29	l59w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἐντίμους ἔχετε	1	The phrase **hold in honor** is a command or instruction to all of the Philippian Christians. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to hold in honor” or “each of you honor” or “all of you honor”
2:29	lk2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐντίμους ἔχετε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **honor**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **honor** with a verbal form of **honor** as the UST does, or in some other way.
2:30	ns1y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὅτι διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ μέχρι θανάτου ἤγγισεν, παραβολευσάμενος τῇ ψυχῇ, ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	1	Here, the pronouns **he** and **him** refer to Epaphroditus. If it would be helpful in your language, consider clarifying this in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “since for the sake of the work of Christ, Epaphroditus came near even to death, risking his life so that he might make up your lack of service to me”
2:30	vj8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ	1	In the phrase **the work of Christ**, Paul is using the possessive form to describe work that is done for Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this phrase in some other way. Alternate translation: “for the sake of working for Christ” or “as a result of working for Christ”
2:30	nhja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **work**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **work** with a verbal form such as “working.” Alternate translation: “for the sake of working for Christ” or “as a result of working for Christ”

Alternate translation: “running the risk of dying” or “taking the risk that he would die”
2:30	x4rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **service**, you can express the idea behind the word **service** by using a verb form such as “serve.” Alternate translation: “so that he might make up for your being unable to serve me”
2:30	g98z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	1	The **lack of service** Paul speaks of here is the inability of the Philippian believers to be present with him in prison. By sending Epaphroditus to Paul, the Philippian believers ministered to Paul’s needs through Epaphroditus, and so Epaphroditus supplied what they could not. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that he might supply what you could not give me” or “so that he might make up for what you could not give”
3:intro	btx3				0	# Philippians 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn verses 4–8, Paul lists the ways he qualifies for being considered a righteous Jew. In every way, Paul was an exemplary Jew, but he contrasts this with the greatness of knowing Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Dogs\n\nThe people of the ancient Near East used dogs as an image to refer to people in a negative way. Not all cultures use the term “dogs” in this way.\n\n### Resurrected bodies\n\nWe know very little about what people will be like in heaven. Paul teaches here that Christians will have some kind of glorious body and will be free from sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Prize\n\nPaul uses an extended illustration to describe the Christian life. The goal of the Christian life is to grow to be like Christ while we live on earth. We can never achieve this goal perfectly, but we must strive for it.
3:1	zu9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** here to refer to anyone who is a fellow believer in Jesus. If this is not clear in your language, you could express this plainly. See how you translated this word in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md).
3:1	ymm2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	χαίρετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	The word **rejoice** is a command or instruction to all of the Philippian Christians. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to rejoice in the Lord” or “each of you rejoice in the Lord” or “all of you rejoice in the Lord”
3:1	b8y6			ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Alternate translation: “in your relationship with the Lord” or “in who the Lord is and what he has done”
3:1	qb78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμῖν δὲ ἀσφαλές	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly how writing these things is a **safeguard** for the Philippians. Alternate translation: “and these teachings will protect you from those who teach what is false”
3:2	ttws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	-1	All three times that the phrase **Beware** occurs in this verse, it is a command or instruction given to all of the Philippian believers. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to beware of” or “Each of you beware of”
3:2	ny6y			βλέπετε	-1	Alternate translation: “Watch out for” or “Look out for” or “Be on guard against”
3:2	zin8			τοὺς κύνας & τοὺς κακοὺς ἐργάτας & τὴν κατατομήν	1	The phrases **the dogs**, **the evil workers**, and **the mutilation** are three different ways of describing the same group of Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel. Paul uses strong expressions to convey his feelings about these Jewish teachers.
3:2	yeax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοὺς κύνας	1	Paul speaks of the Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel as though they were **dogs** in order to show strong contempt for them. A dog is an animal that is common in many parts of the world. Dogs are despised in some cultures but not despised in other cultures, so using the term **dogs** in some cultures may not have the same derogatory or negative meaning that Paul intended. If you have a different animal in your culture that is despised or whose name is used as an insult, you could use this animal instead, if it would fit well in this context.
3:2	n44a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κακοὺς ἐργάτας	1	Here, the phrase **evil workers** refers to Jewish teachers who were teaching things that were contrary to the gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this phrase using plain language. Alternate translation: “false teachers”
3:2	vc2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν κατατομήν	1	The word **mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to circumcision, and the phrase **the mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to the people who taught that circumcision was necessary in order to be in right standing with God. By using the term **mutilation**, Paul is showing the Philippian believers that those who trust in circumcision, and not solely in Christ, mistakenly think that they can earn God’s favor by cutting their bodies. Consider the term that would best communicate this idea in your language, or you could state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “those who cut themselves”
3:2	x8r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν κατατομήν	1	Here, **the mutilation** refers to the Jewish teachers, all circumcised, who were corrupting the gospel by teaching that it was necessary to be circumcised.
3:3	y8yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς γάρ ἐσμεν	1	Here Paul uses **we** to refer to himself and the Philippian believers and anyone else who believes in Christ, so **we** is inclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form.
3:3	xt5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ περιτομή	1	In contrast to its normal usage in the Bible, here Paul uses the term **the circumcision** as a metonym to refer to all true Christians. Normally, the term **the circumcision** was used to refer to Jewish males, all circumcised, but here Paul intentionally uses this term with a spiritual sense to refer to all Christians, both Jews and non-Jew. This would have been surprising to his readers. Paul’s use of **the circumcision** here refers to the inward, spiritual circumcision that the Holy Spirit performs in the hearts of all true Christians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this term using plain language.
3:3	wn2n			οἱ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ λατρεύοντες	1	Alternate translation: “the ones who are empowered by God’s Spirit to worship him” or “the ones who are enabled to worship God by his Spirit” or “the ones who worship God through his Spirit”
3:3	k8ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	1	You can state explicitly that Paul did not have any **confidence** in the “works of” **the flesh**. Alternate translation: “having no confidence in the works of the flesh” or “not trusting that circumcision will please God” or “not trusting that being circumcized will earn God’s favor”
3:3	nkrs			καυχώμενοι ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	1	The phrase **boasting in Christ Jesus** and the phrase **and having no confidence in the flesh** are complementary ideas which express a similar truth. If people truly place their confidence in Christ as their only means of earning God’s favor, they will not put their confidence in themselves or religious acts. Conversely, if people put their confidence in religious rituals and observances, they cannot place their full confidence in Christ. Consider the best way to clearly express these coordinate ideas in your language.
3:3	ox7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **confidence**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **confidence** with an adjective such as **trusting** or a verbal form such as **trust.** Alternate translation: “and we do not trust in our flesh”
3:4	upw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐγὼ ἔχων πεποίθησιν καὶ ἐν σαρκί. εἴ τις δοκεῖ ἄλλος πεποιθέναι ἐν σαρκί, ἐγὼ μᾶλλον	1	Using a type of hypothetical situation, Paul recites his own credentials to illustrate that if observing the law could earn God’s favor, then he had more reason to boast than anyone else. His purpose is to teach the Philippian believers that they should only trust in Christ and not trust in other things to earn God’s favor. Paul explains in [3:7–11](../03/07.md) that his hope is in Christ and not in the things he lists in the next two verses. Alternate translation: “We do not trust in those rituals to make us acceptable to God, although I could very well do that if it would be useful for me”
3:5	d5bq			περιτομῇ ὀκταήμερος ἐκ γένους Ἰσραήλ φυλῆς Βενιαμείν, Ἑβραῖος ἐξ Ἑβραίων, κατὰ νόμον Φαρισαῖος	1	In this verse and the next verse, Paul lists a total of seven things in which he put his confidence before he believed in Christ. In this verse he lists five of those things and in the next verse he lists the remaining two.
3:5	yq98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φυλῆς Βενιαμείν	1	The phrase **of the tribe of Benjamin** means that Paul was from the Israelite tribe of Benjamin and therefore descended from Jacob’s son Benjamin. Consider the best way to say this in your language.
3:5	p4ik			Ἑβραῖος ἐξ Ἑβραίων	1	The phrase **a Hebrew of Hebrews** could mean: (1) that Paul had retained Hebrew customs and spoke the language of the Hebrew people, which was Aramaic. (2) that Paul had no Gentile ancestors, but rather was a pure-blooded Hebrew. Alternate translation: “a Hebrew whose parents and ancestors are all full-blooded Jews” (3) a combination of both of the above. Alternate translation: “a full-blooded Jew who has retained the Hebrew culture, customs, and language”
3:5	we4t			κατὰ νόμον Φαρισαῖος	1	The phrase **according to the law, a Pharisee** means that prior to his conversion Paul had been a Pharisee. He related to the law of Moses as a Pharisee and, therefore, strictly obeyed it as well as the many rules scribes had added to try to safeguard the law of Moses. Alternate translation: “in relation to the law of Moses, I was a Pharisee” or “in relation to how I observed the law of Moses, I was a Pharisee, and therefore, I strictly obeyed every detail of it including the teachings of the scribes”
3:6	f81s			κατὰ ζῆλος διώκων τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, κατὰ δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐν νόμῳ γενόμενος ἄμεμπτος	1	In this verse Paul finishes naming the things in which he put his confidence before he believed in Christ.
3:6	ksr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατὰ ζῆλος διώκων τὴν ἐκκλησίαν	1	Here, the phrase **persecuting the church** is explaining the extent of Paul’s **zeal**. Before Paul believed in Jesus, he thought that by **persecuting the church**, he was serving God and ensuring that the law of Moses was honored and obeyed. If it would be helpful in your language, consider stating the meaning of the phrase **according to zeal, persecuting the church** plainly. Alternate translation: “having so much desire to serve God that I persecuted the church” or “wanting so much to honor God, I persecuted the church”
3:6	n51b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τὴν ἐκκλησίαν	1	Here, **church** is a collective noun. The phrase **the church** refers to Christians as a whole and includes anyone belonging to the group of people who follow Jesus. What Paul means by saying that he had persecuted **the church** is that he formerly persecuted anyone who was a Christian. Alternate translation: “persecuting Christians” or “persecuting anyone who was a Christian”
3:6	hln8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατὰ δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐν νόμῳ γενόμενος ἄμεμπτος	1	The phrase **righteousness {that is} in the law** refers to obeying the righteous guidelines for living that the law of Moses required. Paul obeyed the law so carefully that he believed that no one could find any part of it that he disobeyed. If it would be helpful in your language, consider stating it plainly. Alternate translation: “As regards obeying the law of Moses, no one could say that I ever disobeyed the law”
3:7	i2td		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη, ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	1	This entire verse is Paul’s response to the seven things he listed in [3:5–6](../03/05.md), which he once considered to be spiritually and religiously profitable to himself. In this verse Paul contrasts his former way of viewing things when he was a Pharisee with his new way of viewing things now that he believes in Christ.
3:7	lb8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη, ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	1	In the original language in which Paul wrote this letter, the words **gains** and **loss** were common business terms used for accounting to describe things a business person determined to be either profitable or unprofitable. Here, Paul is using these two terms metaphorically to portray the things he considers spiritually profitable and unprofitable. If your language has similar business or accounting terms that would be natural to use in this context, consider using them here. Alternate translation: “Whatever things I formerly counted as gains, these things I now count as loss for the sake of Christ” or “Whatever things I formerly accounted as gains, these things I now account as loss for the sake of Christ”
3:7	n4lg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη	1	Here, the phrase **Whatever things were gains for me** refers specifically to the list of seven things that Paul has just listed in [3:5–6](../03/05.md) and to anything else in which he would have put confidence before he believed in Christ. Alternate translation: “Whatever things I formerly considered profitable”
3:7	nwdi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **gains**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **gains** by using an adjective such as **profitable**, or you can express it in some other way. Alternate translation: “Whatever things were profitable for me”
3:7	yxtx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **loss**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **loss** by using a verbal phrase such as “worth losing”. Alternate translation: “I consider these things worth losing for the sake of Christ”
3:8	e1fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀλλὰ μενοῦνγε καὶ ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι, διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου, δι’ ὃν τὰ πάντα ἐζημιώθην καὶ ἡγοῦμαι σκύβαλα, ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω	1	In this verse Paul continues the business metaphor which he began in [3:7](../03/07.md).
3:8	epts			ἡγοῦμαι	1	See how you translated the word **consider** in [3:7](../03/07.md).
3:8	wugj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ζημίαν	1	See how you translated the abstract noun **loss** in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “worth losing”
3:8	iji5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι, διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **value**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **value** with an adjective such as “valuable.” Alternate translation: “I consider everything worth losing for the sake of what is most valuable, namely, knowing Christ Jesus my Lord”
3:8	dxql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **knowledge** with a verbal form such as “knowing.” Alternate translation: “because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord”
3:8	cv55			διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	1	Alternate translation: “because knowing Christ Jesus my Lord is worth so much more”
3:8	g1hy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	1	Here, the word **knowledge** does not refer to simply being mentally aware of something or someone, but rather, it refers to having a deep, intimate, personal knowledge or experience of someone or something. Here, it refers to having an intimate and personal knowledge or experience of Christ. Consider the best way to express this meaning in your language. Alternate translation: “of intimately knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” or “of deeply knowing and experiencing Christ Jesus my Lord”
3:8	dh2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δι’ ὃν τὰ πάντα ἐζημιώθην	1	See how you translated the abstract noun **loss** earlier in this verse and in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “for whom I have willingly lost all things”
3:8	cez0			ἡγοῦμαι	2	See how you translated the word **consider** earlier in this verse and in [3:7](../03/07.md).
3:8	ovd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σκύβαλα	1	During Paul’s time the word **dung** was used to refer to excrement and things which were considered worthless and worthy of being thrown out. In the original language in which Paul wrote this letter, the term **dung** was a crude term that referred to things that were discarded as garbage, including dung, and the specific meaning was determined by context. Here, this word could be referring to: (1) excrement, since in the preceding verses Paul has been discussing what comes from the flesh. Alternate translation: “excrement” or “crap” (2) garbage, since Paul is discussing what he now considers worth throwing away in order to gain and know Christ. Alternate translation: “garbage” or “refuse”
3:8	vgf5			κερδήσω	1	See how you translated the word **gains** in [3:7](../03/07.md).
3:8	h3kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω	1	The phrase **so that** is a purpose clause. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose clauses. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of gaining Christ”
3:9	iy4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ εὑρεθῶ ἐν αὐτῷ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the passive verbal phrase **be found** with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “and God might find me belonging to him”
3:9	ubvr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ ἔχων ἐμὴν δικαιοσύνην, τὴν ἐκ νόμου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **righteousness** in some other way. Alternate translation: “not being able to please God by keeping the law”
3:9	w62g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀλλὰ τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you can express the idea behind **faith** by using a verbal form. Alternate translation: “but that which comes by believing in Christ”
3:9	g9a9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλὰ τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ	1	Here, the word **that** refers to “righteousness.” Paul assumes his readers will know this from the context. If this would be unclear in your language, consider stating this explicitly. Alternate translation: “but the righteousness which is through faith in Christ” or “but the righteousness which comes by faith in Christ”
3:9	pbgf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῇ πίστε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **righteousness** in some other way.

3:9	dely		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει	1	In the phrase **by faith**, Paul is leaving out some words that would be needed to complete the sentence in many languages.

3:10	tam1			τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν, καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ κοινωνίαν παθημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	In the original language in which Paul wrote this letter, he closely connects the phrase **the power of his resurrection** and the phrase **the fellowship of his sufferings**. He does this because in Paul’s mind these two things are inseparably linked, and a person cannot know the power of Christ’s resurrection without first sharing in Christ’s suffering. Consider the best way to show the close connection between these two phrases in your language.
3:10	ngz6			τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν	1	See how you translated the word “knowledge” in [3:8](../03/08.md). Here, the word **know** does not refer to simply being mentally aware of something or someone, but rather, it refers to having a deep, intimate, personal knowledge or experience of something or someone.

This phrase would then mean that Paul is saying that he is not yet spiritually perfect or complete. Alternate translation: “Not that I have already attained spiritual perfection” or “Not that I am already spiritually complete” or “Not that God’s work in me is already complete” or “Not that God’s work in me is already perfected” (2) that Paul has not yet reached the goals he has for himself and so has not received his reward. Alternate translation: “Not that I have yet reached my goals and received my reward from God” (3) Paul has not yet finished the work God gave him to do with his life, and then died and received his reward from God. Alternate translation: “Not that I have finished my work and received my reward from God”

Alternate translation: “I might grasp the things for which Christ Jesus grasped me”
3:13	tzg8			ἀδελφοί	1	See how you translated the word **Brothers** in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md) and [3:1](../03/01.md).
3:13	kqk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἐγὼ ἐμαυτὸν οὐ λογίζομαι κατειληφέναι	1	Paul does not explicitly state what **{it}** is that he has not yet **grasped**. He is probably referring to becoming perfectly like Jesus and to fully knowing Jesus. You may choose to state this in your translation, as the UST does, or you may leave it ambiguous, as the ULT does.
3:13	hjs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἓν δέ	1	In the phrase **But one thing**, Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

3:13	ia2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ μὲν ὀπίσω ἐπιλανθανόμενος, τοῖς δὲ ἔμπροσθεν ἐπεκτεινόμενος	1	In the phrase **forgetting {what is} behind and straining for {what is} ahead**, Paul is using the imagery of a person who is in a race to win a prize. Paul portrays himself as a runner in this metaphor, and he continues using this metaphor until the end of [Philippians 3:14](../03/14.md). If this metaphor is unfamiliar in your culture, consider using another metaphor that would be familiar to your readers, or you may state this in plain language, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “like a runner, I forget what is behind me and put all of my effort into running toward the finish line in front of me” or “like a runner, I have one focus, and therefore I do not look backward as I run, but only look forward as I strain with all my might so that I will reach the finish line”
3:14	z39s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκω εἰς τὸ βραβεῖον	1	In this verse Paul continues using the metaphor of a runner who is competing in a foot race in order to win a prize. In this verse Paul says that his **goal**, which he works hard for, is to win the **prize** which God promises to give every person who obediently follows Christ. If this metaphor would be unfamiliar in your culture, consider using another metaphor, or use plain language to translate the idea behind this metaphor. Alternate translation: “I do all I can to pursue the goal of winning the prize of God’s upward call in Christ Jesus” or “I work hard so that I can reach my goal”
3:14	jhtv			σκοπὸν & εἰς τὸ βραβεῖον τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The phrases **the goal** and **the prize** could be related to each other in one of two ways. They could: (1) be focusing on the same basic idea. Alternate translation: “the goal, which is to be given the prize of God’s upward call” or “my goal, which is to receive the prize of God’s upward call” (2) be focusing on different things, in which case **the goal** is referring to the goal of Paul’s life, while **the prize** is referring to what Paul hopes to receive once he has successfully achieved his goal. Alternate translation: “the goal and toward being given the prize of God’s upward call” or “the goal and toward receiving the prize of God’s upward call”
3:14	lmr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τὸ βραβεῖον τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The phrase **the prize of the upward calling of God** could mean: (1) that **the prize** is **the upward calling of God**.

Alternate translation: “answer God’s upward call to receive his prize” or “answer God’s invitation to receive his prize”
3:14	cq3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The word **upward** probably refers to both the origin of God’s call and to the direction of God’s call. In other words, the phrase **the upward calling of God** probably refers both to the fact that the **calling** is from God and that the calling is also a heavenly calling to move towards God. Alternate translation: “God’s heavenward call”

(2) modifying the phrase **I press on**. Alternate translation: “I press on in Christ Jesus toward the goal for the prize of the upward calling of God”
3:14	d75h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ σκοπὸν διώκω εἰς τὸ βραβεῖον τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of a **goal**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **goal** in another way.

If it would be helpful in your language, consider stating this in plain language. Alternate translation: “For many live” or “For many people conduct their lives”
3:18	zwp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πολλοὶ γὰρ	1	The phrase **For many** leaves out a word that would be needed in some languages to be completely clear.
