front:intro	m2jl				0	# Introduction to Titus\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Titus\n\n1. Paul instructs Titus to appoint godly leaders. (1:1–16)\n2. Paul instructs Titus to train people to live godly lives. (2:1–3:11)\n3. Paul ends by sharing some of his plans and sending greetings to various believers. (3:12–15)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Titus?\n\nPaul wrote the book of Titus. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a believer, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted believers. After he became a believer, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus.\n\n### What is the book of Titus about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to Titus, his fellow worker, who was leading the churches on the island of Crete. Paul instructed him about selecting church leaders. Paul also described how believers should behave toward each other. He also encouraged them all to live in a way that pleases God.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Titus.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to Titus” or “A Letter to Titus.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### In what roles can people serve within the church?\n\nThere are some teachings in the book of Titus about whether a woman or divorced man can serve in positions of leadership within the church. Scholars disagree about the meaning of these teachings. Further study on these issues may be necessary before translating this book.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural **you**\n\nIn this book, the word **I** refers to Paul. Also, the word **you** is almost always singular and refers to Titus. The exception to this is 3:15. (See [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### What is the meaning of **God our Savior**?\n\nThis is a common phrase in this letter. Paul meant to make the readers think about how God forgave them in Christ for sinning against him, and by forgiving them he saved them from being punished when he judges all people. A similar phrase in this letter is **our great God and Savior Jesus Christ**.
1:intro	c7me				0	# Titus 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nPaul formally introduces this letter in verses 1–4. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.\n\nIn verses 6–9, Paul lists several qualities that a man must have if he is to be an elder in the church. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns) Paul gives a similar list in 1 Timothy 3.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Elders\n\nThe church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include overseer, elder, pastor, and bishop.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Should, may, must\n\nThe ULT uses different words that indicate requirements or obligations. These verbs have different levels of force associated with them. The subtle differences may be difficult to translate. The UST translates these verbs in a more general way.

1:1	xrtm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκλεκτῶν Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “of the people whom God has chosen”
1:1	tn97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and for their knowledge of the truth” or “and so that the chosen people of God might know the truth”
1:1	fyf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	 τῆς κατ’ εὐσέβειαν	1	Here, **godliness** is an abstract noun that refers to living in a way that pleases God. Alternate translation: “that is suitable for honoring God”
1:2	xyz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	 ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου	1	Here **hope** could be connected to: (1) **godliness**, meaning that if we live to please God, we will have hope of eternal life. Alternate translation: “which gives us the certain hope of everlasting life” or (2) **knowledge of the truth**, meaning that this hope of eternal life is part of the truth, and that knowing the truth gives hope of eternal life. Alternate translation: “and that teaches us to expect eternal life” 
1:2	u0gk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “which leads us to confidently expect eternal life”
1:2	vyuu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ὁ ἀψευδὴς Θεὸς 	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression here instead of this double negative. Alternate translation: “the God who is completely trustworthy”

1:3	b22h			καιροῖς ἰδίοις	1	Alternate translation: “at the proper time”
1:3	swi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐφανέρωσεν & τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	Paul speaks of God’s word as if it were an object that could be visibly shown to people. Alternate translation: “he caused me to understand his message”
1:3	abc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν κηρύγματι	1	Paul assumes that his readers will understand that **the proclamation** refers to the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

1:4	gu55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γνησίῳ τέκνῳ	1	Though Titus was not Paul’s biological **son**, they share a common faith in Christ. Paul considers relationship to Christ through faith to be more important than biological relationship. Thus, because of their relative ages and shared faith in Christ, Paul considers Titus as his own son. It may also be that Paul led Titus to faith in Christ, and so Titus is like a son in this spiritual sense. Alternate translation: “like a son to me”
1:4	wx6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ κοινὴν πίστιν	1	Paul and Titus both share the same **faith** in Christ. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “because we both trust in Jesus Christ”
1:4	h93t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη	1	This was a common greeting Paul used.

1:6	jen8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴ τίς ἐστιν ἀνέγκλητος	1	This is the beginning of the description of the character of an elder. Paul assumes that Titus understands that he is to choose men who fit the following description. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers.

1:6	ab70		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ἀνέγκλητος	1	To be **blameless** is to be known as a person who does not do bad things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this positively. Alternate translation: “a person who has a good reputation”
1:6	q6uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἀνήρ	1	This means that he has only **one wife**; that is, he does not have any other wives or concubines. This also means that he does not commit adultery and may also mean that he has not divorced a previous wife. Alternate translation: “a man who has only one woman” or “a man who is faithful to his wife”
1:6	wd6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τέκνα & πιστά	1	This could refer to: (1) children who believe in Jesus. Alternate translation: “children who are faithful to God” (2) children who are trustworthy. Alternate translation: “children who are honest” 
1:7	lz7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸν ἐπίσκοπον	1	The word **overseer** is another name for the same position of spiritual leadership that Paul referred to as “elder” in 1:5. This term focuses on the function of the elder: he oversees the activities and people of the church. Alternate translation: “an elder in charge of God's people” 
1:7	g2zf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Θεοῦ οἰκονόμον	1	Paul speaks of the church as if it were God’s **household**, and the overseer as if he were a servant in charge of managing that household.

Indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “In contrast”
1:8	vkq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φιλάγαθον	1	Here Paul is speaking of **what is good** as if it were a person who could be someone's **friend**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a person who loves to do good things”
1:8	xy11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σώφρονα & ἐγκρατῆ	1	The terms **sensible** and **self-controlled** are very similar in meaning and may be translated by one term if the target language does not have two similar terms.

1:9	xwy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀντεχόμενον	1	Paul speaks of devotion to the Christian faith as if it were grasping the faith with one’s hands.

1:9	xy10			κατὰ τὴν διδαχὴν	1	Alternate translation: “that agrees with the things that we taught him”
1:9	abcj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The connecting words **so that** introduce a goal or purpose relationship.

1:9	pzi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ	1	The word translated here as **sound** normally refers to being physically healthy. Paul is speaking of this **teaching** as if it were a living thing that could be healthy or sick. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “correct teaching”
1:10	w9kk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ματαιολόγοι	1	Here, **empty** is a metaphor for useless, and **empty talkers** are people who say useless or foolish things. Alternate translation: “people who say useless things”
1:10	ga6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φρεναπάται	1	The word **deceivers** describes people who are actively trying to convince people to believe in something other than the true gospel that Paul preaches. Alternate translation: “people who convince others to believe things that are not true”
1:10	abcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ματαιολόγοι, καὶ φρεναπάται	1	Both **empty talkers** and **deceivers** refer to the same people, those who are also **rebellious**. Those people taught false, worthless things and wanted other people to believe them. Alternate translation: “people who say wrong things so that others will believe things that are not true”
1:10	pu74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ ἐκ τῆς περιτομῆς	1	Here, **circumcision** represents the Jewish believers who taught that men must be circumcised in order to please God. This teaching is false. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the ones who teach that men must be circumcised in order to please God” 
1:11	f4iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὓς δεῖ ἐπιστομίζειν	1	The implication is that these people must be stopped from teaching. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You must prevent them from spreading their false teachings” or “Someone must stop them from deceiving others by their words”
1:11	aqi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅλους οἴκους ἀνατρέπουσιν	1	The issue was that they were leading families away from the truth and destroying their faith. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “are ruining the faith of entire families”
1:11	at7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αἰσχροῦ κέρδους χάριν	1	Here Paul refers to **profit** as **shameful**, meaning that the activity of accepting money for teaching wrong things brings shame on the teacher. Consider how to express this in your language. Alternate translation: “and increasing their shame by taking money for it” 
1:12	tr1j			τις ἐξ αὐτῶν, ἴδιος αὐτῶν προφήτης	1	Alternate translation: “A Cretan, one that they themselves consider to be a prophet”
1:12	y3zb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται	1	The word **always** here is an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Cretans have a reputation to be liars” or “Cretans tend to be liars”
1:12	h3jb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κακὰ θηρία	1	This metaphor is speaking of **Cretans** as if they were **evil beasts**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as dangerous as wild animals”
1:12	xyz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	γαστέρες ἀργαί	1	Here the part of the body that stores food is used to represent the person who eats all the time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “lazy gluttons” or “lazy people who just want to eat”
1:13	fif8			δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν ἔλεγχε αὐτοὺς ἀποτόμως	1	Alternate translation: “For that reason, you must use strong language that the Cretans will understand when you correct them”
1:13	abck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν	1	The connecting words **For this reason** introduce a reason-result relationship. The reason is that what the Cretan prophet said about his people is true (they are liars, evil, and lazy), and the result is that Titus should rebuke them severely for behaving that way. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: “Therefore” 
1:13	dlgr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὺς	1	Here the pronoun **them** could refer to: (1) the Cretan believers in general. This seems likely since the **testimony** is about all Cretans, and verse 14 says that they should not pay attention to “commands of people turning away from the truth.” In other words, they should not pay attention to the false teachers. Alternate translation: “the Cretan believers” or (2) the Cretan false teachers. In this case, verse 14 would be telling the false teachers not to pay attention to other false teachers. Alternate translation: “the false teachers” 
1:13	je3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα ὑγιαίνωσιν ἐν τῇ πίστει	1	See note on **sound** in [Titus 1:9](../01/09/pzi1). Alternate translation: “so they will have a healthy faith” or “so their faith may be true” or “so that they believe only what is true about God”
1:13	abcl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	Here, **so that** marks being **sound in the faith**, as well as what follows in verse 14, as the goal or purpose of rebuking the Cretans. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that this is the purpose. 
1:13	xyz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ πίστει	1	Here the abstract noun **faith** represents the things that the people believe about God. Alternate translation: “in what they believe about God”
1:14	p28i			Ἰουδαϊκοῖς μύθοις	1	Alternate translation: “false teaching of the Jews”
1:14	m4a5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀποστρεφομένων τὴν ἀλήθειαν	1	Paul speaks of the truth as if it were an object that one could turn away from or avoid. Alternate translation: “who reject the truth”
1:15	qtb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	πάντα καθαρὰ τοῖς καθαροῖς	1	Here, Paul uses or invents a proverb in order to teach that being pure or pleasing to God is a matter of a person's inward thoughts, not a matter of outward actions or rituals. Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “If people are pure on the inside, everything that they do will be pure” or “When people have only good thoughts, nothing that they do will offend God”
1:15	nx42			τοῖς καθαροῖς	1	Alternate translation: “to those who are acceptable to God”
1:15	abcn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	The connecting word **But** introduces a contrast between people who are pure and people who are corrupt and unbelieving.  Indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “However,”
1:15	n3wk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῖς δὲ μεμιαμμένοις καὶ ἀπίστοις, οὐδὲν καθαρόν	1	Paul speaks of sinners as if they were physically corrupted or dirty. Alternate translation: “But if people are morally defiled and do not believe, they cannot do anything pure” or “But when people are full of sin and unbelief, nothing that they do is acceptable to God”
1:16	abco		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	The connecting word **but** introduces a contrast between what these corrupt people say (that they know God) and what their actions show (that they do not know God).  Indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “nevertheless,”
1:16	i3l2			τοῖς & ἔργοις ἀρνοῦνται	1	Alternate translation: “how they live proves that they do not know him”
2:intro	h3il				0	# Titus 2 General Notes\n\nPaul continues giving Titus reasons to preach God’s word, and explains how the older men, older women, young men, and slaves or servants should live as believers.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Gender roles\n\nScholars are divided over how to understand this passage in its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are completely equal in all things. Other scholars believe God created men and women to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church. Translators should be careful not to let their understanding of this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n### Slavery\n\nPaul does not write in this chapter about whether slavery is good or bad; Paul teaches slaves to faithfully serve their masters. He teaches all believers to be godly and live rightly in every situation.
2:1	tpi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σὺ δὲ	1	Here, **you** is singular and refers to Titus. If it is helpful, you could include the name “Titus” here, as in the UST.

2:2	xyz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτας & εἶναι	1	A verb is lacking here that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be clearer in your language, you could supply a verb here, drawing from the idea of “speak” in the previous verse, such as “teach” or “exhort.”   Alternate translation: “Teach older men to be”
2:2	xy13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	νηφαλίους & σεμνούς, σώφρονας	1	These three words are very close in meaning and may be combined into one or two terms if the target language does not have three separate terms.

2:2	abc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑγιαίνοντας τῇ πίστει τῇ ἀγάπῃ, τῇ ὑπομονῇ	1	Here the word **sound** means to be firm and unwavering. It applies to **faith**, **love**, and **perseverance**. See the note about **sound** on [Titus 1:9](../01/09/pzi1) and the note about **sound in faith** on [Titus 1:13](../01/13/je3r).

2:2	m14y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑγιαίνοντας τῇ πίστει	1	You can state the abstract noun **faith** as a verb if that is clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “to firmly believe the true teachings about God”

2:3	gl8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πρεσβύτιδας ὡσαύτως	1	Some verbs are lacking here that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be clearer in your language, you could continue the verbal ideas from the previous two verses and apply them here, as well, such as “Teach older women to be” or “Exhort older women to be.” Alternate translation, removing the comma: “In the same way, teach older women to be” or “Also teach older women to be”
2:3	g9re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἴνῳ πολλῷ δεδουλωμένας	1	People who cannot control themselves and drink too much wine are spoken of here as if they were a slave to the wine. Alternate translation: “controlled by their desire for wine”

2:3	abc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καλοδιδασκάλους	1	If it is helpful in your language, you can indicate the contrast between this good quality and the two preceding bad qualities. Alternate translation: “but rather, teachers of what is good” 
2:4	unh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	Here, **so that** marks training **the younger women** as the goal or purpose of being “teachers of what is good” in verse 3. Of course, living in a good way, as verse 3 describes, helps the older women to be teachers of what is good. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is the purpose. 
2:4	abc5			φιλάνδρους	1	Alternate translation: “lovers of their own husbands”

2:5	papr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	Here, **so that** marks not insulting **the word of God** as a goal or purpose of the good behavior described in verses 4 and 5. This is not the only purpose of living well, but if the young women of the church do not do these things, people will consider God's message to be worthless. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a purpose of what came before. 
2:5	abcq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἵνα μὴ ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ βλασφημῆται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “so that no one insults the word of God” or “so that no one insults God by saying bad things about his message”
2:5	t5v6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **word** stands for “message.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the message from God”
2:6	i3hv			ὡσαύτως	1	Paul's instructions for the different groups of believers are similar. See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.
2:7	tn76			περὶ πάντα	1	It is possible that this phrase is part of the previous sentence instead of this one. If the Bible used in your area uses this phrase to end the previous sentence, you may choose to do the same.
2:7	x73u			σεαυτὸν παρεχόμενος	1	Alternate translation: “show yourself to be” or “you yourself must serve as”

3:intro	zh6x				0	# Titus 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Paul continues giving Titus instructions on how to teach the elders and people under his care in Crete. \n\n\nIn verses 1-7 Paul explains how, by God's mercy, the Holy Spirit makes our lives new and motivates us to live in a new way. \n\n\nIn verses 8-11 Paul explains what Titus should avoid and how to treat those who cause contention among the believers. \n\n\nIn verses 12-15, Paul closes the letter by telling Titus what to do after he appoints elders in Crete and by delivering greetings from those with him.\n\nVerse 15 formally concludes this letter. This is a common way of ending a letter in the ancient Near East.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Genealogies\n\nGenealogies (verse 9) are lists that record a person’s ancestors or descendants and show from what tribe and family a person came. For example, priests came from the tribe of Levi and the family of Aaron. Some of these lists included stories of ancestors and even of spiritual beings. These lists and stories were used to argue about where things came from and about how important various people were.
