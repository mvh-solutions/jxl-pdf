(1:1–2:10)\n* Jonah disobeys Yahweh’s first call to go to Nineveh. (1:1–3)\n* Jonah is on the ship with the Gentile sailors. (1:4–16)\n* Yahweh provides a large fish to swallow Jonah, who prays and is rescued. (1:17–2:10)\n2. Jonah goes to Nineveh. (3:1–4:11)\n* Yahweh again calls Jonah to go to Nineveh, and Jonah proclaims Yahweh’s message. (3:1–4)\n* Nineveh repents. (3:5–9)\n* Yahweh decides not to destroy Nineveh. (3:10)\n* Jonah is very angry with Yahweh. (4:1–3)\n* Yahweh teaches Jonah about grace and mercy. (4:4–11)\n\n### What is the book of Jonah about?\n\nJonah, son of Amittai, was a prophet from Gath Hepher, a village in the northern kingdom of Israel (2 Kings 14:25). This book tells about what happened to Jonah. It tells how Yahweh shows mercy and grace to Gentiles. It also tells how the Ninevites repented and called out to Yahweh for mercy. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\nYahweh sent Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh that he was ready to punish them. Yahweh said that if they would repent he would not harm them. However, Jonah was an Israelite, and he did not want the Ninevites to repent and escape punishment. So Jonah tried to sail away in the opposite direction instead of doing what Yahweh told him to do, but Yahweh stopped him by sending a storm and a large fish to swallow him.\n\nJonah repented and warned the Ninevites. As a result, Yahweh taught him that he is concerned about all people, not just the Israelites.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book is traditionally titled “The Book of Jonah” or just “Jonah.” Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as “The Book about Jonah.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Jonah?\n\nJonah was probably involved in the writing of this book. However, scholars do not know who actually wrote it.\n\nJonah lived in the northern kingdom of Israel, during or before the reign of King Jeroboam II of Israel. He probably prophesied sometime between 800 and 750 B.C.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the nation of Assyria?\n\nDuring the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the ancient Near East. Nineveh was the capital city of Assyria.\n\nAssyria was cruel to its enemies. Eventually, Yahweh punished the Assyrians for the wicked things that they did.\n\n### Did Assyria convert to Judaism?\n\nSome scholars think that the Assyrians started worshiping Yahweh alone. However, most scholars think that they continued to worship other false gods, perhaps after a brief time of worshiping Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
1:intro	xvp2				0	# Jonah 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe narrative of this chapter starts abruptly. This is a typical way for a prophetic book to begin. The translator should not add information to smooth this introduction, but the first verse could be made into several sentences to make a more natural beginning. See the UST.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Miracle\n\nIn verse [1:17](../01/17.md), there is the mention of “a great fish.” It may be difficult to imagine a sea creature big enough to swallow a man whole, and we do not know what kind of creature this was. Jonah then survives for three days and nights inside the fish. This is something that God made to happen. Translators should not try to explain miraculous events in an attempt to make them easier to understand. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Situational irony\n\nThere is an ironic situation in this chapter. This means that people do or say things that are the opposite of what one would expect them to do. Jonah is a prophet of God, and as such, he would be expected to endeavor to do God’s will. Instead, he runs away from God. Although the Gentile sailors are not Israelites, they act out of faith and fear of Yahweh when sending Jonah to an almost certain death by throwing him overboard. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/willofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Sea\n\nPeople in the ancient Near East saw the sea as chaotic, and they did not trust it. Some of the gods they worshiped were gods of the sea. Jonah’s people, the Hebrews, feared the sea greatly. However, Jonah’s fear of the sea was not enough to keep him from sailing on a ship to avoid doing what Yahweh commanded. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Implicit information\n\nEven though no one knows for sure where Tarshish was, the writer assumes that the reader knows that Jonah had to face away from Nineveh to go there. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:1	jdr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ דְּבַר־יְהוָ֔ה	1	This phrase introduces the first half of the story of Jonah.

The repetition of this same phrase introduces the second half of the story (3:1). 
1:1	ll6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ דְּבַר־יְהוָ֔ה	1	This is an idiom meaning that Yahweh spoke or communicated his message in some way.

1:2	x5ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נִֽינְוֵ֛ה הָ⁠עִ֥יר הַ⁠גְּדוֹלָ֖ה	1	Here, **great** means both large and important. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the large and important city, Nineveh”
1:2	v2xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֠וּם	1	**Get up** is an idiom that means that Jonah should take action. It does not mean that he was sitting or lying down at the time that God spoke to him. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning, state the meaning plainly, or use only the verb “Go.” Alternate translation: “Look alive” or “Prepare yourself”

1:3	f5sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֤קָם יוֹנָה֙ לִ⁠בְרֹ֣חַ	1	Here the words **got up** mean that Jonah took action in response to God’s command, but his action was to disobey instead of to obey.

Alternate translation: “But Jonah decided to run away” or “Jonah prepared himself, but to run away”
1:3	n96t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֖י יְהוָ֑ה & מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֖י יְהוָֽה	1	The expression **the face of Yahweh** represents his presence.

1:5	u2bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֱלֹהָי⁠ו֒	1	The author assumes that his audience will know that by **his own god** he does not mean the true God, Yahweh.

1:7	t5p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠נַפִּ֣ילָה גֽוֹרָל֔וֹת	1	We do not know the exact method that the sailors used to cast lots.

You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have done a terrible thing!”
1:10	us1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֤י יְהוָה֙	1	This is an expression that refers to the face of Yahweh to represent his presence. The idea of Yahweh’s presence also includes his knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. By running away, Jonah is hoping that Yahweh will not notice that he is disobeying. Alternate translation: “from the presence of Yahweh”
1:10	jdrb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	כִּ֥י הִגִּ֖יד לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	This verse provides background information about Jonah's disobedience to help readers understand why the sailors were afraid. The sailors reacted in fear because Jonah had already told them that he was running away from Yahweh, the God he worshiped. In your translation, present this information in a way that makes it clear that this is background information. Alternatively, place this information before the first sentence about the sailors being afraid.
1:10	go19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי־יָדְע֣וּ הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֗ים כִּֽי־מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֤י יְהוָה֙ ה֣וּא בֹרֵ֔חַ כִּ֥י הִגִּ֖יד לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	Jonah told the sailors **that he was running away from before the face of Yahweh** before they reacted **with great fear**.

1:11	ik6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִשְׁתֹּ֥ק הַ⁠יָּ֖ם מֵֽ⁠עָלֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	Here, **calm down from upon us** is an idiom that means “calm down for our benefit.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that the sea will calm down for us” or “in order to make the sea become calm”

Alternate translation: “The sea was going forward and storming. Therefore, they said to him, “What should we do to you so that the sea will calm down from upon us” 
1:12	h982			כִּ֚י יוֹדֵ֣עַ אָ֔נִי כִּ֣י בְ⁠שֶׁ⁠לִּ֔⁠י הַ⁠סַּ֧עַר הַ⁠גָּד֛וֹל הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה עֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Alternate translation: “because I know that this huge storm is my fault”
1:12	khbq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	 וְ⁠יִשְׁתֹּ֥ק הַ⁠יָּ֖ם מֵֽ⁠עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	See how you translated the idiom **calm down from upon** in [verse 11](../01/11.md).
1:13	lcd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּחְתְּר֣וּ הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֗ים	1	They did not do as Jonah suggested. The implication is that the men did not want to throw Jonah into the sea.

1:14	q2xq			וַ⁠יִּקְרְא֨וּ אֶל־יְהוָ֜ה	1	Alternate translation: “Therefore, the men prayed loudly to Yahweh”
1:14	jdr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אָנָּ֤ה	1	**Ah!** is an exclamation that is expressing intense desperation. Use an exclamation that would communicate that meaning in your language.
1:14	wz6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל־נָ֣א נֹאבְדָ֗ה בְּ⁠נֶ֨פֶשׁ֙ הָ⁠אִ֣ישׁ הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה	1	In this context, **the life of this man** means “taking the life of this man.” You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “please do not kill us for taking the life of this man” or “even though we are going to cause this man to die, please do not kill us”
1:14	vv5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אַל־תִּתֵּ֥ן עָלֵ֖י⁠נוּ דָּ֣ם נָקִ֑יא	1	Here, **do not put innocent blood upon us** is an idiom that means ““do not consider us guilty of killing an innocent person.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and please do not blame us for his death” or “and do not hold us accountable for having killed someone who did not deserve to die”
1:14	qnsr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַל־נָ֣א נֹאבְדָ֗ה בְּ⁠נֶ֨פֶשׁ֙ הָ⁠אִ֣ישׁ הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה וְ⁠אַל־תִּתֵּ֥ן עָלֵ֖י⁠נוּ דָּ֣ם נָקִ֑יא	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

2:intro	ae4k				0	# Jonah 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins with a prayer by Jonah, and many translators have chosen to set it apart by setting its lines farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. Also, the prayer is in the style of poetry. To show that, many translations put each line of the poem on a separate line. Translators can follow these practices, but they are not obligated to do so. You may wish to follow the format of a well-known translation in your area.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sea\n\nThis chapter contains many terms that describe the sea. If people who speak your language are unfamiliar with the sea, you will need to discuss how to describe these things. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Poetic Imagery\n\nPrayers in Scripture are often expressed in poetry. Poetry frequently uses metaphors and other imagery to more powerfully communicate very emotional topics. For example, Jonah thought he would die in a fish in the sea, and so he compares being trapped there as being surrounded by the bars of the earth and being in the “belly of Sheol.” Jonah is overwhelmed by the depth of the sea and expresses this by speaking about being at the “base of the mountains.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nHebrew poetry often expresses something in one line and then expresses that same thought in another line but using different words. This emphasizes the ideas in the parallel lines. For example, verse 2 has two halves that are saying basically the same thing. \n\nI cried out to Yahweh from my distress, \n     and he answered me;\nfrom the belly of Sheol I cried out; \n     you heard my voice.\n\nEach half also has two parts. The first part of each half is saying the same thing as the other, and the second part of each half is also saying the same thing as each other. If your language would not repeat ideas like this in poetry, see: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] for ideas for how to translate this kind of poetry.\n\n
2:1	alr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהָ֑י⁠ו	1	Here, the author is using the possessive form to describe **Yahweh** as the God whom Jonah worshiped. The word **his** does not mean that Jonah owned God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, the God to whom he belonged,”
2:2	al5b			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: “Jonah said”

If your language has a way to indicate poetry, you could use it here. This line begins a poem describing Jonah’s experience in the fish, his prayer, and God’s answer. The poem describes these things from a time after they had already happened. 
2:2	s7fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	קָ֠רָאתִי מִ⁠צָּ֥רָה לִ֛⁠י אֶל־יְהוָ֖ה וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠נִי	1	In this poem that is also a prayer, Jonah refers to God in both the third person (using “he”) and the second person (using “you”). If this would not be natural in your language, you could use the second-person form throughout the poem. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, I cried out to you during my distress, and you answered me”
2:2	wdr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠נִי	1	The implication is that Yahweh answered Jonah's prayer for help by helping him. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and Yahweh helped me"

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases in a way that would show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I cried out to Yahweh from my distress, and he answered me; that is, from the belly of Sheol I cried out, and you heard my voice”
2:2	w8wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בֶּ֧טֶן שְׁא֛וֹל	1	Here Jonah is speaking of the fish's belly as if it were **Sheol**, that is, the place of the dead. Jonah is expressing that he believed that this is where he would die very soon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “When I was almost dead”
2:2	ab77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	שְׁא֛וֹל	1	**Sheol** was the name of the place where they believed that people went after they died. It was thought to be a shadowy world located somewhere under the ground. The New Testament equivalent seems to be “Hades,” where the dead wait for judgment (see Rev. 20:13). If your language has a word for this place, you may want to use it here or borrow the word “Sheol.”
2:2	jdrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שָׁמַ֥עְתָּ קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	Here, **you heard my voice** is equivalent to the phrase “he answered me” in the previous line of poetry. In this context, Jonah is expressing that Yahweh both heard him and acted to save him. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You heard me and acted to save to me”
2:3	glp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠לְבַ֣ב יַמִּ֔ים	1	Here the term **heart** is a metaphor for the center of something. To be in **the heart of the seas** means to be completely surrounded by sea water. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “under the sea water”
2:3	twte		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	יַמִּ֔ים	1	Here, Jonah refers to the sea by using the plural **seas** to intensify the idea. If it would be more natural in your language, you can use the singular and intensify the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the vast ocean”
2:3	p8fd			וְ⁠נָהָ֖ר יְסֹבְבֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Alternate translation: “and the sea water flowed all around me”
2:3	c6jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	מִשְׁבָּרֶ֥י⁠ךָ וְ⁠גַלֶּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	The terms **billows** and **waves** mean similar things. Both of these are disturbances on the surface of the ocean. Jonah is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could use a single term and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “your powerful waves” 
2:3	xoo2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מִשְׁבָּרֶ֥י⁠ךָ וְ⁠גַלֶּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Here, Jonah is using the possessive form **your** to describe the **billows** and **waves** because they were caused by God. If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could say this in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the billows and waves that you created” 
2:4	jdr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	**But I** shows that there is a contrast between the actions of Yahweh, which Jonah had just talked about, and his own response, which he will talk about now. In your translation, indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “On my part”
2:4	x1w9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִגְרַ֖שְׁתִּי	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You drove me out”
2:4	z1yx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠נֶּ֣גֶד עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **eyes** is a metonym meaning seeing, and seeing is a metonym for the knowledge, notice, and attention of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from before you” or “from your presence” or “to where you do not notice me”
2:4	ua1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	אַ֚ךְ	1	Here, **yet** indicates a contrast between Jonah being driven away from God and Jonah's hope to see the temple again. In your translation, indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “nevertheless” 
2:5	abc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֲפָפ֤וּ⁠נִי מַ֨יִם֙ עַד־נֶ֔פֶשׁ תְּה֖וֹם יְסֹבְבֵ֑⁠נִי	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases in a way that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Water had closed around me even as far as life; indeed, the deep was surrounding me”
2:5	rf4b			מַ֨יִם֙	1	Alternate translation: "The sea"
2:5	ca31			עַד־נֶ֔פֶשׁ	1	Here the Hebrew term **life** can also possibly mean “neck” or “soul.” In any case, the water was threatening to end his life. Alternate translation: “up to my neck” or “as far as my soul”
2:5	nr3v			תְּה֖וֹם יְסֹבְבֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Alternate translation: “deep water was all around me”
2:5	p1fw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ס֖וּף	1	The word **seaweed** means a kind of long, stringy plant that grows in the sea.
2:6	z36i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠אָ֛רֶץ בְּרִחֶ֥י⁠הָ בַעֲדִ֖⁠י לְ⁠עוֹלָ֑ם	1	Here Jonah is speaking of **the earth** under the water as if it had **bars** like a prison. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the earth was like a prison that was about to lock me in forever”
2:6	c8v0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חַיַּ֖⁠י	1	Here, **life** represents Jonah himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my very being, alive”
2:6	dc3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תַּ֧עַל מִ⁠שַּׁ֛חַת חַיַּ֖⁠י	1	Here, the term **pit** has a double meaning. Jonah is in a deep place that could be called a pit, and this is also a word that is used in poetry for the place of the dead. Jonah is expressing that he felt certain that he would die in this place. Alternate translation: “but you saved my life from the place of the dead”
2:6	i3mx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהָֽ⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could put this phrase at the beginning of the sentence after **but** or **you**.
2:6	geyd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אֱלֹהָֽ⁠י	1	Here, Jonah is using the possessive form **my** to describe **God**. If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could use a more natural expression. Alternate translation: “the God to whom I belong” 
2:7	jdr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠הִתְעַטֵּ֤ף עָלַ⁠י֙ נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	This phrase could mean that: (1) Jonah was already in the process of dying when he remembered Yahweh. Alternate translation: “when my life was fainting away from me” (2) Jonah had given up hope of being rescued and resigned himself to the fact that he would die. Alternate translation: “when my spirit inside me had fainted”
2:7	l2b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה זָכָ֑רְתִּי	1	The implication is that when Jonah **remembered** Yahweh, he also prayed to him. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I thought of Yahweh and asked him to help me”
2:7	bql5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה זָכָ֑רְתִּי	1	Jonah changes to talking about Yahweh in the third person here and then continues to talk to him in the second person in the rest of the prayer. If this would not be natural in your language, you could use the second-person form here. Alternate translation: “I remembered you, Yahweh” 
2:7	ue9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תָּב֤וֹא אֵלֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תְּפִלָּתִ֔⁠י אֶל־הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	Jonah speaks as if his **prayer** could travel to God and his temple. This means that God heard his prayer and responded to it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then you in your holy temple heard my prayer”
2:8	u1l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מְשַׁמְּרִ֖ים הַבְלֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	Here the term **empty vanities** is probably an idiom referring to idols of false gods. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Those who give attention to useless idols” or “Those who pay attention to useless gods”
2:8	fac9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חַסְדָּ֖⁠ם יַעֲזֹֽבוּ	1	Here, **covenant faithfulness** could refer to: (1) the faithfulness of God to his people. Alternate translation: “are rejecting you, who would be faithful to them” (2) the faithfulness of the people to God. Alternate translation: “are abandoning their commitment to you”
2:9	q3yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י	1	This expression shows that there is a contrast between Jonah himself and the people about whom Jonah had just spoken. They paid attention to useless gods, but he would worship Yahweh. In your translation, indicate this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “But as for me”
2:9	nfd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠ק֤וֹל תּוֹדָה֙ 	1	The phrase **with a voice of thanksgiving** is an idiom that means “while praising God.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully. Alternate translation: “while praising you out loud”
2:9	jdrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יְשׁוּעָ֖תָ⁠ה לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1	Here, **Salvation belongs to Yahweh** is an idiom that means “only Yahweh can save.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly.

2:9	y5sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יְשׁוּעָ֖תָ⁠ה לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1	Here Jonah makes a statement about Yahweh in the third person as part of his prayer to Yahweh. If this would not be natural in your language, you could add “you” to make it the second-person form. See also the Note concerning the phrase “I cried out to Yahweh from my distress … ” in [2:2](../02/02/jdrc). Alternate translation: “Salvation belongs to you, Yahweh” 
2:9	r4j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יְשׁוּעָ֖תָ⁠ה לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of the word **Salvation**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form such as “save.” Alternate translation: “Yahweh is the one who saves people”
2:10	qrhh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוָ֖ה לַ⁠דָּ֑ג	1	The content of what **Yahweh spoke** was a command to vomit up Jonah.

2:10	na0f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוָ֖ה לַ⁠דָּ֑ג	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “And Yahweh said to the fish, ‘Vomit up Jonah onto the dry land’”
2:10	dz3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֶל־הַ⁠יַּבָּשָֽׁה	1	In some languages it would be unnecessary or unnatural to express that the **land** was **dry**. If this is true of your language, you could use a more natural expression for the land at the edge of the sea. Alternate translation: “upon the ground” or “onto the shore”
3:intro	z3ut				0	# Jonah 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter returns to the narrative about Jonah.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Animals\n\nAccording to the king’s proclamation, the animals had to participate in the fast which he had ordered. This was unusual and probably indicates that the king wanted God to see that all of Nineveh was taking his proclamation of destruction very seriously. There is nothing in the law of Moses that instructed the people to have their animals participate in fasting. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### God Repenting or Relenting\n\nThe last verse of this chapter says, “So then God relented in regard to the evil that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.” This concept of God changing His mind may seem inconsistent with the fact that God’s character and his plans do not change. \n\nHowever, God's actions of punishment or mercy depend on human actions. God often changes his action from punishment to mercy in response to humans who repent of their sins, because he prefers to be merciful. Because the Ninevites repented, God did not follow through with the judgment that he told Jonah to proclaim, and Jonah described that in a human way as “relenting” or as some versions say, “changing his mind.” The reader understands that this was God’s plan from the beginning. \n\n### God Planning Evil\n\nThe Hebrew word translated as “evil” in the ULT is very broad, including moral evil, physical evil, and everything that is bad. So in verse 10, the author uses the same word for God's planned destruction of Nineveh as he used for the people's wicked behavior. The ULT translates each of these uses as “evil” to show the user that it is the same Hebrew word in each place. By using the same word, the author is showing that when people repent of moral evil, God relents from doing physical evil (punishment). God never does moral evil. If your language would not use the same word for both of these, you will want to use different words for them. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Size of Nineveh\n\nThe ruins of the ancient city of Nineveh that have been uncovered are about 8 miles or 13 kilometers around. So, although Nineveh was a very big city in the ancient world, it was not as big as most modern cities. The description of Nineveh as “a journey of three days” seems to mean that it took three days to walk through it, although that seems to be more time than would be needed to walk through a city of that size. Of course, it depends on several factors: what a person is doing while on this journey through the city, and that there may have been extensive settlements outside the city walls. Also, the length of time given is probably only a general approximation. Translators should simply translate the text and not try to reconcile it with what modern archeologists think that they know about ancient Nineveh and the people who walked through it. \n\n### A City Great to God\n\nVerse three in the ULT describes Nineveh as “a city great to God.” In Hebrew, saying that something is "to God" or "of God" is an idiom that means that it is an extreme example of that thing. For example, in Genesis 30:8, Rachel describes the struggle she has had with her sister as “a struggle of God,” meaning “a mighty struggle” or “an extremely difficult struggle.” Other examples of this idiom in the Bible are found in Genesis 23:6, Exodus 9:28, 1 Samuel 14:15, Psalms 36:6, and Psalms 80:10. In Jonah 3:3, this idiom probably means that Nineveh was an extremely large city. See how this is translated in the Bible that is most commonly used in your area. You may want to follow how they translated this idiom.\n\n\n

3:3	jd8r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עִיר־גְּדוֹלָה֙ לֵֽ⁠אלֹהִ֔ים	1	Here, because of the phrase **a journey of three days**, the focus of **great** seems to be the size of the city. The phrase **great to God** is an idiom that means “extremely large.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “an enormous city”
3:3	ye82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַהֲלַ֖ךְ שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת יָמִֽים	1	This could mean: (1) that a person had to walk for three days to completely go through the city from one side of the city to the opposite side. Alternate translation: “a city so large that it would take a person three days to walk through it” (2) that it took three days to see the whole city. Alternate translation: “a city so large that it would take a person three days to see it all”

Alternate translation: “So Jonah began walking into the city for one day, and as he went he called out”
3:4	r94k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יִּקְרָא֙ וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר	1	The expression **called out and said** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in some languages.

3:5	h9dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אַנְשֵׁ֥י נִֽינְוֵ֖ה	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, here it has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

3:8	mzx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה	1	The implication is that these are the people's domestic animals. They are not wild animals. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: "and every animal that they own"

Alternate translation: “and they must cry out loudly to God and ask for mercy” or “and they must pray earnestly to God that he would be merciful to them” 
3:8	si34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠יִקְרְא֥וּ	1	The pronoun **they** probably refers to the people, not to the animals. If this is not clear for your readers, you could include this information. Alternate translation: “and the people must cry out”
3:8	n3ls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֶ⁠חָמָ֖ס אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּ⁠כַפֵּי⁠הֶֽם	1	Here, **hands** represents "doing." This refers to the violence that the people of Nineveh were doing.

It could be translated as a statement: “We do not know.” Or it could be stated as an initial word and be part of the next sentence: “Perhaps”
3:9	z3jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָשׁ֔וּב וְ⁠נִחַ֖ם הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Here the author speaks of God changing his mind about bringing judgment as if God were turning around and walking in the opposite direction.

Alternate translation: “This god may decide instead to have compassion” or “This god may do the opposite of what he said and be merciful”
3:9	jdrg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מֵ⁠חֲר֥וֹן אַפּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Here **the burning of his nose** is an idiom meaning that the person is angry.

3:10	ab85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־הָ⁠רָעָ֛ה	1	The word translated as “evil” here is very broad, including moral evil, physical evil, and everything that is bad. It is the same word used in the previous sentence (and verse 8) to describe the actions of the Ninevites. The author is showing that when people repent of moral evil, God relents from doing physical evil (punishment). God never does moral evil. If this is clear in your language, you may want to use the same word in both sentences. If that is not clear, you may want to use different words. Alternate translation: “in regard to the punishment” 
3:10	yijn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הָ⁠רָעָ֛ה	1	Here the author is using the adjective **evil** as a noun to refer to an evil thing. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

3:10	it1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֥א עָשָֽׂה	1	Here, what God **did not do** could be made explicit if it would be helpful in your language. Alternate translation: “and he did not punish them” or “and he did not destroy them”
4:intro	ys57				0	# Jonah 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nJonah continues the narrative and brings the book to an unusual conclusion, ending it with a question from God. This emphasizes that the book is not really about Jonah. It is about God’s desire to be merciful to everyone, whether Jew or Gentile. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Prophecy delayed\n\nAccording to the law of Moses, a prophet must prophesy what Yahweh tells him to prophesy, and his words must come true. If that did not happen, the penalty was death, because that unfulfilled prophecy shows that the man was not a real prophet. But when Jonah told the city of Nineveh that it was going to be destroyed in 40 days, it did not happen at that time. This is because God reserves the right to be merciful. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Jonah’s anger\n\nWhen God did not destroy Nineveh, Jonah was angry with God because Jonah hated the people of Nineveh. They were enemies of Israel. But God wanted Jonah and the readers of this book to learn that God loves all people.\n\n### Characteristics of God\n\nIn verse 2, Jonah attributes a series of characteristics to God. A Jewish reader of this book would recognize this as the description that God used about himself when speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai ([See Exodus 34:6-7\n](Exo/34/6.md)). \n\n### God’s grace\n\nWhen Jonah went outside the city, he got very hot; God graciously provided some relief through the plant. God was trying to teach Jonah that he is a merciful God through this object lesson. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn this chapter, Jonah uses a rhetorical question to show how angry he is at Yahweh. Yahweh then uses a series of three rhetorical questions to teach Jonah about the attitude that he should have. If your language would not use rhetorical questions for these purposes, then use a more natural form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Evil\n\nThe Hebrew word translated as “evil” in the ULT is very broad, including moral evil, physical evil, and everything that is bad. God never does moral evil. In verse 1, the author says that Jonah considered God's act of mercy in sparing the people of Nineveh to be evil. In verse 2, Jonah describes God as “relenting from evil.” In verse 6, Jonah's situation and attitude are described as evil. This is after the actions of the Ninevites are described as evil in [1:2](../01/02.md), [3:8](../03/08.md), and [3:10](../03/10.md), and the situation of the sailors in [1:7](../01/07.md). The ULT translates the word as “evil” in each place to show the irony that the author wants to convey by using the same Hebrew word for each different bad thing in the book and for one good thing—God's mercy on Nineveh (from Jonah's perspective). If your language would not use the same word for both moral and physical evil, you will want to use different words for each of them. 
4:1	jdr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע אֶל־יוֹנָ֖ה	1	This sentence introduces the next part of the story, in which Jonah responds to God because God saved the city of Nineveh. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Now this was evil to Jonah” or “But for Jonah, this was evil” 
4:1	m7ty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע	1	The pronoun **this** refers to the fact that God did not destroy Nineveh. If this is not clear for your readers, you could say that here. Alternate translation: “But the fact that God spared Nineveh was evil”

You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “But this was exceedingly evil to Jonah”
4:1	abc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֖חַר לֽ⁠וֹ	1	The phrase **it burned to him** is an idiom that speaks of Jonah’s anger as if it were a fire burning inside him. Alternate translation: “and he was very angry”

Alternate translation: “Yahweh, this is what I said when I was still in my own country!”
4:2	ab79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְהוָה֙ הֲ⁠לוֹא־זֶ֣ה דְבָרִ֗⁠י עַד־הֱיוֹתִ⁠י֙ עַל־אַדְמָתִ֔⁠י	1	The implication is that Jonah correctly foretold what would happen.

Alternate translation: “with a cool head” or “slow to get angry” or “very patient”
4:2	jv5c			וְ⁠רַב־חֶ֔סֶד	1	Alternate translation: “and very faithful” or “and full of love for your people”
4:2	wl7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִחָ֖ם עַל־הָ⁠רָעָֽה	1	Here, **evil** refers to the physical destruction of the city of Nineveh and its people. It does not refer to moral evil. In this context, this phrase means that God feels sadness about causing bad things to happen to people who sin, and he acts differently when sinners repent of their sin. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. See the discussion about evil in the chapter introduction, and see how you translated this word in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “and you decide not to punish sinners who repent”

If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly.

4:4	ab83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠הֵיטֵ֖ב חָ֥רָה לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	The reason for Jonah’s anger can be made explicit. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Is it right for you to be angry that I did not destroy Nineveh”
4:4	tti6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠הֵיטֵ֖ב חָ֥רָה לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Yahweh is using the question form to teach Jonah that he is not right to be angry.

4:6	t21k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠הַצִּ֥יל ל֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠רָֽעָת֑⁠וֹ	1	Here the term **evil** could be referring to one of two things (or both at the same time). It could be referring to: (1) Jonah's physical discomfort or distress, meaning the intense heat of the sun shining on Jonah’s head. (2) Jonah’s wrong attitude concerning God’s decision not to destroy Nineveh. If both meanings can be preserved by using a general term, that is preferable. Alternate translation: “in order to save Jonah from his bad situation”
4:6	ynu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וַ⁠יִּשְׂמַ֥ח יוֹנָ֛ה & שִׂמְחָ֥ה גְדוֹלָֽה	1	Here, **rejoiced with great rejoicing** is an emphatic construction that uses a verb and its object that come from the same root.

You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “so that the plant died”
4:8	jdr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י׀ כִּ⁠זְרֹ֣חַ הַ⁠שֶּׁ֗מֶשׁ	1	This clause provides background information about the time of day to help readers understand what happens next in the story.

4:9	w24z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠הֵיטֵ֥ב חָרָֽה־לְ⁠ךָ֖ עַל־הַ⁠קִּֽיקָי֑וֹן	1	God is using the question form to lead Jonah to draw a conclusion about his selfish attitude. God is not seeking information. Since Jonah answers the question, it would be good to keep the question form if that would be natural in your language.

4:9	ri6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	חָרָֽה־לְ⁠ךָ֖ & חָֽרָה־לִ֖⁠י	1	The phrases **it burns to you** and **it burns to me** are examples of an idiom that speaks of Jonah’s anger as if it were a fire burning inside him. See how you translated this idiom in [4:1](../04/01.md).

4:10	ab88		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שֶׁ⁠בִּן־לַ֥יְלָה הָיָ֖ה וּ⁠בִן־לַ֥יְלָה אָבָֽד	1	The expression **son of** describes a person or thing which shares the qualities of something else. This idiom, **son of a night** means that the plant existed only briefly. If it would be helpful, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it grew in one night and died the next” or “it grew quickly and died just as quickly”
