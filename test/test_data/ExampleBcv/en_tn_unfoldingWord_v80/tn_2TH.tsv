front:intro	krd6				0	# Introduction to 2 Thessalonians\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of 2 Thessalonians\n\n1. Greetings and thanksgiving (1:1-2)\n1. Believers suffer from persecution (1:3-12)\n     * God uses persecution to increase faith, love, and endurance in believers (1:3-4)\n     * God is just: (1:5-12)\n       * God will make believers worthy of his kingdom\n       * God will give relief to believers\n       * God will punish those who persecute believers\n1. Some believers misunderstand about the second coming of Christ (2:1-12)\n     * Christ’s return has not yet happened (2:1-2)\n     * Instruction about the events that will precede the return of Christ (2:3-12)\n1. Paul’s confidence that God will save the Thessalonian believers (2:13-17)\n     * Paul calls the Thessalonian believers to “stand firm” (2:13-15)\n     * Paul prays that God will comfort them (2:16-17)\n1. Paul requests that the Thessalonian believers pray for him (3:1-5)\n1. Paul give commands about idle believers (3:6-15)\n1. Closing (3:16-17)\n\n### Who wrote 2 Thessalonians?\n\nPaul wrote 2 Thessalonians. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted believers. After he became a believer, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul is the author of this letter, but he includes Silvanus and Timothy as senders of the letter. Paul wrote this letter while he, Silvanus, and Timothy were staying in the city of Corinth.\n\n### What is the book of 2 Thessalonians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the believers in the city of Thessalonica. He encouraged the believers because they were being persecuted. He told them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also wanted to teach them again about Christ’s return. He also warned them that they should not be idle but should work as they wait for Christ to return.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Thessalonians” or “Second Thessalonians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The Second Letter to the Christians/believers in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the “second coming” of Jesus?\n\nPaul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation. And he will cause there to be peace everywhere. Paul also explained that a “man of lawlessness” will come before Christ’s return. This person will obey Satan and cause many people to oppose God. But Jesus will destroy this person when he returns.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### How are pronouns used in this letter?\n\nIn this letter, the words “we” and “us” refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. If your language differentiates between inclusive and exclusive pronouns, use an exclusive pronoun for these. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n\nIn this letter, the words “you” and “your” are plural and refer to the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of 2 Thessalonians?\n\nFor the following verses, some ancient manuscripts have a different reading than others. The ULT follows the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in your area that your people are familiar with, consider using the reading that it follows. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.\n* “and the man of lawlessness is revealed” (2:3). The ULT, UST, and most modern versions read this way. Other versions follow the reading, “and the man of sin is revealed.”\n* “For God chose you as the firstfruits for salvation” (2:13) The ULT, UST, and some other versions read this way. The other reading is, “For God chose you from the first/beginning for salvation.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	m987				0	# 2 Thessalonians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nVerses 1-2 formally introduce this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type in which the sender identified himself, then the recipient, then gave a greeting.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible.\n\nA paradox occurs in verses 4-5 where Paul talks about the Thessalonian believers’ faithfulness through persecution as “evidence of the righteous judgment of God.” People would not normally think that believing in God while being persecuted is a sign of God’s righteous judgment. But the fact that God gave them the ability to persevere in their faith is evidence that God claims them as his own and will judge them as worthy of his kingdom. In verses 5-10, Paul goes on to explain more of God’s righteous judgment, that God will reward those who believe in him and that he will punish those who afflict his people. ([2 Thessalonians 1:4-5](./04.md))\n\nAnother paradox occurs in verse 9 where Paul describes the penalty for rejecting God as “eternal destruction.” Normally when something is destroyed it ceases to exist. But in this case, the people who reject God will experience eternal separation from God, as the verse goes on to explain. Being separated from God destroys all that was enjoyable about their lives, and this continuous destruction is what they experience through eternity. ([2 Thessalonians 1:9](../01/09.md))
1:1	hm3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σιλουανὸς	1	**Silvanus** is the Latin form of “Silas.” **Silvanus** is the name of a man, the same person listed in the book of Acts as Paul’s fellow traveler. If your readers may not know that these two are the same person, you could use the name “Silas” in the text and “Silvanus” in the footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:1	ge00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος; τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	You may want to fill in the words necessary to make this a complete sentence. Alternate translation: “Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy send this letter to the church” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis)
1:1	l8q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος	1	Although Paul wrote this letter, he identifies Silvanus and Timothy as also sending it. This means that they were with him and were in agreement with it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that clear, as in the UST. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
1:1	eajo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Θεῷ Πατρὶ ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul speaks figuratively of the believers as though they were occupying space inside of God and Jesus. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to God and Jesus. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “sharing life with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
1:2	g6rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Many languages have different ways to offer good wishes as they greet. Paul greeted his letter recipients with a blessing. Use a form that would be a good wish or blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “We pray that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace” or “I wish you grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “May the grace and peace of God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be your portion” or “May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ show grace and give peace to your hearts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:2	bv9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **grace** and **peace**, you can express these ideas as verbs or in another way. Alternate translation: “May God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be gracious to you and give rest to your inner being” or “...be favorable to you and make you at ease” or “...be kind to you and set your heart at rest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:3	o6v9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/checking/headings	General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\nIn verses 3-12, Paul gives thanks for the believers in Thessalonica and prays for them. A heading for this section might be, “Thanks and Prayers.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/checking/headings]])
1:3	m6z5			εὐχαριστεῖν ὀφείλομεν & πάντοτε	1	# General Information:\n\nPaul is expressing here that he has a moral obligation to God to give thanks for the believers in Thessalonica. Use a natural expression for this in your language. Alternate translation: “We are bound always to thank” or “We can do no other than to thank” or “We must give thanks continually to”
1:3	ea59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	εὐχαριστεῖν ὀφείλομεν τῷ Θεῷ πάντοτε	1	Paul uses **always** as a generalization meaning “often” or “regularly.” Alternate translation: “We should often give thanks to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:3	o01t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐχαριστεῖν ὀφείλομεν τῷ Θεῷ πάντοτε περὶ ὑμῶν, ἀδελφοί	1	If your readers might misunderstand his meaning and think that Paul is expressing an obligation only and that he does not actually pray for the Thessalonians, you could express the reality explicitly. Alternate translation: “We always thank God for you, brothers, as we ought” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:3	h6t9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Here, **brothers** means fellow Christians, including both men and women. If your readers understand that it is addressed only to men, you may need to use both the masculine and the feminine forms of that word in your language. If you use a nonfigurative word such as “believers”, see that both the genders are addressed. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:3	ezaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καθὼς ἄξιόν ἐστιν	1	If it is difficult to express **just as it is fitting** in your language or if it is unclear what **it** refers to, consider starting a new sentence here to state it clearly. Alternate translation: “When we give thanks for you we are doing the right thing” or “Giving thanks for you is right for us to be doing” or “ … is the right thing to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:3	emu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑπεραυξάνει ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you can express this idea as a verb. Alternate translation: “you believe in Christ more and more” or “you increasingly trust in Christ” or “you rely on Christ more each day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:3	xy7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πλεονάζει ἡ ἀγάπη ἑνὸς ἑκάστου, πάντων ὑμῶν, εἰς ἀλλήλους	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you can express this idea as a verb. Alternate translation: “each of you sincerely loves one another more and more” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:3	bmn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἀλλήλους	1	Here, **one another** means fellow believers. Alternate translation: “each other” or “each believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
1:4	kx1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὺς ἡμᾶς	1	Here, **ourselves** is added to **we** to emphasize that even the apostle Paul and his associates are boasting about the Thessalonian believers. Alternate translation: “even we” or “we are the ones who” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns)
1:4	gcth		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὑπομονῆς ὑμῶν, καὶ πίστεως	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **endurance** and **faith** or if it is unclear how these two terms relate, you can express these same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “how you patiently continue to trust in Jesus” or “how you persevere in believing in the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:4	qlo9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς διωγμοῖς ὑμῶν, καὶ ταῖς θλίψεσιν	1	The two words **persecutions** and **afflictions** are saying very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize how difficult life has been for the Thessalonian believers. If two words are difficult to find in your language or if your language does not use repetition in this way, you can use one word with this meaning and make the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “as you have been going through all these very difficult times” or “as people make you suffer in all the ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:4	md0d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πίστεως ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς διωγμοῖς ὑμῶν	1	Here **faith in all your persecutions** does not mean to believe in or trust in persecutions. If your readers might be confused by that, you could express it more clearly. Alternate translation: “faith in Jesus Christ during all the times you are persecuted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:5	rs3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔνδειγμα τῆς δικαίας κρίσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ, εἰς τὸ καταξιωθῆναι ὑμᾶς	1	The **evidence** that Paul is referring to here is the faithful endurance of the Thessalonian believers while suffering persecution, which he mentioned in verse 4. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It may also be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Your endurance while suffering is a clear indication of God’s righteous judgment, that he considers you worthy” or “Your faithfulness through persecution shows that God is just and right to consider you worthy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:5	dad9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰς τὸ καταξιωθῆναι ὑμᾶς τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	You can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “that God will consider you worthy to be part of his kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:5	xm2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ ἧς καὶ πάσχετε	1	Here, **also** could mean: (1) the Thessalonian believers are suffering for the kingdom of God as well as being counted worthy of it. Alternate translation: “being a part of which is also the reason that you are suffering” (2) the Thessalonian believers are suffering along with other believers. Alternate translation: “which is why you are going through sufferings along with many others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:6	cxx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴπερ δίκαιον παρὰ Θεῷ	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you know that God is just” or “for God is certainly right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1:6	id3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρὰ Θεῷ, ἀνταποδοῦναι τοῖς θλίβουσιν ὑμᾶς θλῖψιν	1	Here, **to return** means to cause someone to experience the same thing that they did to someone else as though the same action were bouncing back onto the people who did that action. Use a natural expression for this kind of reciprocal action. Alternate translation: “for God to afflict those who are afflicting you” or “for God to pay back those who are afflicting you” “for God to do the same to those who are afflicting you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:6	zemk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀνταποδοῦναι τοῖς θλίβουσιν ὑμᾶς θλῖψιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **affliction**, you can express the same idea in another way.

1:7	hxy2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ὑμῖν & ἄνεσιν	1	The words **and relief to you** continue the description of what God is right “to return” to people (verse 6). If this would not be understood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “and it is righteous for God to give relief to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:7	l3ht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ ὑμῖν τοῖς θλιβομένοις, ἄνεσιν μεθ’ ἡμῶν	1	Here, **you who are being afflicted** refers to the Thessalonian believers, and **us** refers to Paul and his associates. Other people are afflicting both groups because of their faith in Jesus. Alternate translation: “and relief to you who are being afflicted just as we are being afflicted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:7	knbb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑμῖν & ἄνεσιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **relief**, you can express this idea with a verb or in another way. Alternate translation: “to relieve you” or “to rescue you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:7	bcxy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῖς θλιβομένοις	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom other people are afflicting” or “from the affliction that others are causing you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:7	fh5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ ἀποκαλύψει τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, **at the revealing** is an indication of the time when the suffering believers will have relief from their suffering.

1:8	p1ie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διδόντος ἐκδίκησιν τοῖς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **vengeance**, you can express this idea in another way. Since this is part of God’s justice, do not use a word that implies that God is doing something illegal or inappropriate. Alternate translation: “punishing the people” or “judging the ones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:8	ynt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς μὴ εἰδόσι Θεὸν	1	Here, **those who have not known God** refers to those who have refused the relationship with God that he had offered to them. Alternate translation: “on those who did not want to know God” or “on those who have rejected God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:8	gv0v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τοῖς μὴ ὑπακούουσιν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ	1	The phrase, **not obeying the gospel** could refer to: (1) the same people as **those not having known God**. Alternate translation: “and who are not obeying the gospel” (2) a separate group. Alternate translation: “and also on those who are not obeying the gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:8	m37v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑπακούουσιν τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ	1	The phrase, **obeying the gospel** is an idiom that means to live according to everything that God tells us in the gospel message. Alternate translation: “living according to the message of the gospel” or “heeding the admonitions that are part of the gospel message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:8	dkkx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῷ εὐαγγελίῳ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the general possessive form **of our Lord Jesus** to describe **the gospel**. The specific meaning here is that the gospel is about Jesus. Alternate translation: “the gospel that is about our Lord Jesus” or “the gospel message that tells us about our Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:9	plw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἵτινες δίκην τίσουσιν	1	Here, **who** refers to the people who are not obeying the gospel, not to the Lord Jesus. You may prefer to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Those people will pay the penalty” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:9	peog		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἵτινες δίκην τίσουσιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of the word **penalty**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who will be punished by God” or “whom God will punish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:9	ebf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δίκην τίσουσιν	1	Here, the phrase **pay the penalty** is an idiom meaning to suffer the consequences of doing something bad. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “will suffer the consequences” or “will undergo the retribution” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:9	yruv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὄλεθρον αἰώνιον	1	Here, **eternal destruction** further describes the **penalty** that people will experience if they refuse to “obey the gospel.” The **destruction** that these people will experience is **eternal**, that is, it never ends. Therefore, do not translate with the meaning that these people will cease to exist. They will continue to exist, but continually experience the ruin of their lives. If necessary, put this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “God will punish them eternally” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:9	qhta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Here, **the face of the Lord** is an idiom meaning the presence of the Lord. Alternate translation: “away from our Lord Jesus” or “separated from the presence of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:9	htqg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the possessive form is describing **power** that has **glory**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use the adjective “glorious” to describe the **power**. Alternate translation: “his glorious power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:9	wmdm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς δόξης τῆς ἰσχύος αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **glory** and **power**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “experiencing how magnificent and powerful he is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:10	ugk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅταν ἔλθῃ & ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	Here, **that day** is the day when Jesus will return to the world. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the day when Jesus returns to the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:10	bi2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνδοξασθῆναι ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ θαυμασθῆναι ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς πιστεύσασιν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as his saints glorify him and all those who have believed marvel at him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:10	wsvb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐνδοξασθῆναι ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ θαυμασθῆναι	1	Here, the two verbs **to be glorified**and **to be marveled at** indicate the result of Jesus’ coming, not the purpose. Use a connector here that indicates result. Alternate translation: “as his saints glorify him and all those who have believed marvel at him” or “with the result that his saints will glorify him and all those who have believed will marvel at him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:10	z1hg			ἐνδοξασθῆναι ἐν τοῖς ἁγίοις αὐτοῦ, καὶ θαυμασθῆναι ἐν πᾶσιν τοῖς πιστεύσασιν	1	The **saints** and **those who have believed** are one group of people, not two. If your readers might be confused by this, you could combine these into one phrase. Alternate translation: “with the result that all of his saints, that is, the believers, will glorify him and marvel at him” or “as all of his people glorify him and marvel at him”
1:10	e56p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπιστεύθη τὸ μαρτύριον ἡμῶν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you have believed our witness when we shared it with you” or “when we testified about the saving power of Jesus Christ, you believed what we said” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive)
1:11	zy14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ὃ	1	Here, **for this** connects verse 11 to verse 10, so that verse 11 gives the means or method (prayer for the Thessalonian believers) for reaching the purpose that verse 10 has just described (for Jesus to “be glorified … and marveled at”). Use a natural way in your language for introducing this relationship. Alternate translation: “This is why” or “To this end” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:11	ik19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	καὶ προσευχόμεθα πάντοτε περὶ ὑμῶν	1	Paul is using **always** as an exaggeration in order to emphasize how often he prays for them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language. Alternate translation: “we also pray regularly for you” or “we continue to pray for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:11	hiv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς κλήσεως	1	Here, **calling** refers to God appointing or choosing people to belong to him and to proclaim his message of salvation through Jesus. Alternate translation: “to appoint you to belong to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:11	r8gk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πληρώσῃ πᾶσαν εὐδοκίαν ἀγαθωσύνης, καὶ ἔργον πίστεως ἐν δυνάμει	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **desire**, **goodness**, **faith**, and **power**, you can express these ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “he may make you able to do all of the good things that you want to do because you trust in Jesus and because God is powerful” or “he may empower you to act on what you believe in order to do good things in every way that you desire, because God is powerful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:11	c7o6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ πληρώσῃ	1	Here, **and he may fulfill** adds another reason why Paul and his associates **pray always** for the Thessalonian believers.

Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how much more powerful Jesus is than the man of lawlessness.
