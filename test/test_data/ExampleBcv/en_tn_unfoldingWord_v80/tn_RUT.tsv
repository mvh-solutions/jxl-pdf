front:intro	f68r				0	# Introduction to Ruth\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Ruth\n\n1. How Ruth came to Bethlehem with Naomi (1:1–22)\n1. Boaz helps Ruth as she gleans (2:1–23)\n1. Boaz and Ruth at the threshing floor (3:1–18)\n1. How Ruth became the wife of Boaz (4:1–16)\n1. Obed born to Ruth and Boaz; the genealogy of David (4:13–22)\n\n### What is the Book of Ruth about?\n\nThis book is about a non-Israelite woman named Ruth. It tells how she came to join the people of Yahweh. The book also explains how Ruth became an ancestor of King David.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has the title **Ruth** because she is the main person in it. Translators can use a title such as **The Book about Ruth**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### When did the events in the Book of Ruth occur?\n\nThe story of Ruth is set during the time when there were **judges** in Israel. This was after the people of Israel had entered into the land of Canaan, but before they had a king. The “judges” were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. These leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of them may have served only certain tribes.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab?\n\nIn a period when Israel was often unfaithful to Yahweh, a woman from Moab shows great faith in him. The Israelites’ frequent lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of this woman from a foreign land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\n### What important marriage custom is found in the Book of Ruth?\n\nIsraelites practiced what is called **levirate marriage**. In this custom, the closest male relative of a man who died without any children was obligated to provide for his widow by marrying her. Usually this would be one of the man’s brothers. Any children born to them were to be regarded as children of the dead man. They did this so that the dead man would have descendants. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could fulfil this obligation.\n\n### What was a **kinsman-redeemer**?\n\nA person’s close relative or relatives were expected to act as **kinsmen-redeemers** (2:20 ULT) for him or her. They were responsible to provide for a relative in need, fulfil obligations of **levirate marriage**, and buy back land into the family that had been sold to someone outside of the family. In the Book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.\n\n### What was **gleaning** in the Book of Ruth?\n\nIn Israel, poor people were allowed to follow after the men who harvested a field. These **gleaners** picked up stalks of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped. In this way, poor people were able to find some food. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.\n\n### What is covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty?\n\nA covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill. Covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty is when a person does what they said they would do, according to the covenant that they had made. God made a covenant with Israel, in which he promised that he would love and be faithful to the Israelites. The Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other.\n\nThe Book of Ruth shows that what kinsmen-redeemers do for their relatives is part of Israel’s duties in God’s covenant with them. The story of Boaz, Ruth, and Naomi gives examples to all of Israel of the good effects of covenant faithfulness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])\n\n### What function did city gates have in the ancient Near East?\n\nCity gates in the time of Boaz were meeting places for the city elders. Elders were honored men who decided business matters and legal matters together. The city walls were thick, especially at the entryways, and the gates had guard towers beside and above them. Therefore the gateway opening provided a large shady area for public meetings, and there were places for important people to sit. For this reason, Boaz and the other elders sat in the gateway.\n\nSome English Bible versions speak of Boaz sitting **at** the city gate, but it may be best for translators to make clear that Boaz sat **in** the city gateway.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How does the Book of Ruth change from one topic to another topic?\n\nThe Book of Ruth often changes to new topics or new parts of the story. The ULT uses various words to indicate these changes, such as **so,** **then,** and **now**. Translators should use the ways most natural in their own languages to signal these changes.
1:intro	irf4				0	# Ruth 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### **It happened in the days when the judges ruled**\n\nThe events of this book occur during the period of Judges. The book is concurrent with the book of Judges. To understand the historical context of the book, the translator may wish to review the book of Judges.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Women without a husband or children\n\nIn the ancient Near East, if a woman lacked a husband or sons, she was considered to be in a dire circumstance. She would not have been able to provide for herself. This is why Naomi told her daughters to remarry.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Contrast\n\nThe actions of Ruth the Moabite are intended to contrast with the actions of Naomi the Jew. Ruth shows great faith in Naomi’s God, while Naomi does not trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])

Displaying Boaz’s good character is an important point in this chapter.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### **So that it may be well with you**\n\nNaomi wanted Ruth to have a secure home with a good husband who would care for her. She could see that Boaz would be the best husband for her. She also thought that Boaz, as a kinsman-redeemer, had an obligation to marry her.

3:2	nd8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	הִנֵּה	1	The word **Look** indicates that the following statement is very important. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

3:10	cbd3			הָ⁠רִאשׁ֑וֹן	1	This refers to the way that Ruth had earlier provided for her mother-in-law by staying with her and gleaning grain for food for them.
3:10	n84d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠בִלְתִּי־לֶ֗כֶת אַחֲרֵי֙	1	**because you have not looked for marriage among**. Ruth could have ignored Naomi’s need and looked for a young and handsome husband for herself outside of Naomi’s relatives, but she did not. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:11	jdr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThis phrase indicates that what came before in verse 10 is the reason for what follows in verse 11. This can be indicated with a word like **Therefore**. If it would be helpful in your language to put the reason after the result, the order would be: Boaz is motivated to perform the role of kinsman-redeemer (verse 11) **because** he has seen how much kindness Ruth has shown to Naomi (verse 10). If you choose this order, you will need to combine the verses and the verse numbers (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]]).
3:11	ei93			בִּתִּ⁠י֙	1	Boaz used this expression as a sign of respect toward Ruth as a younger woman. Use the form of address that would be appropriate in your language.

So this was an idiom meaning “all of the important people in my city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]).
3:11	ab31			אֵ֥שֶׁת חַ֖יִל	1	**a woman of good character**, **a good woman**

3:12	fvq5			גֹּאֵ֖ל קָר֥וֹב מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי	1	It was the duty of the male relative who was closest in family relationship to the man who died to help his widow. See how you translated **kinsman-redeemer** in [2:20](../02/20/zu5f) and make sure that it also makes sense here.
3:13	gcl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־יִגְאָלֵ֥⁠ךְ	1	**redeem** here means “marry according to our custom concerning widows.” Boaz is referring to the expectation that the closest male relative of Ruth’s dead husband would marry her and raise a son to carry on the dead man’s family name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	tkz9			חַי־יְהוָ֑ה	1	**as surely as Yahweh lives** or **by the life of Yahweh**. This was a common Hebrew vow that obligated the speaker to perform what he said. Use the normal phrasing for a vow in your language.

3:15	aj7u			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	Most ancient copies have **he went**, referring to Boaz, but some have **she went**, referring to Ruth. Some English versions have “he” and some have “she” here. Most scholars believe that **he went** is the original meaning.
3:16	s7dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִי־אַ֣תְּ בִּתִּ֑⁠י	1	This appears to be an idiom that probably means **What is your status, my daughter?** In other words, Naomi is probably asking if Ruth is now a married woman. Alternatively, the question could mean simply **Is that you, my daughter?** (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:16	ab34			בִּתִּ֑⁠י	1	Ruth is actually Naomi’s daughter-in-law, but Naomi calls her **my daughter** as an endearment. Keep this translation if it is acceptable in your culture. Otherwise, use “daughter-in law.”

4:intro	pz6m				0	# Ruth 4 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### King David\n\nDespite being a Moabitess, Ruth became an ancestress of David. David was Israel’s greatest king. It may be surprising that a Gentile would become a part of such an important lineage, but it reminds us that God loves all people. Ruth had great faith in Yahweh. This shows us that God welcomes all who trust in him.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### **You must also acquire Ruth the Moabite woman**\n\nWith the privilege of using the family’s land came the responsibility to take care of the widows of the family. Therefore, the relative who wanted to use Naomi’s land had to also help Ruth to have a son who would carry on the family name and inheritance and provide for her.\n\n### **This was the custom in former times**\n\nThis is a comment made by the writer of the text. This indicates that there was a considerable period of time between the events that occurred and the time when they were written down.
4:1	jdr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וּ⁠בֹ֨עַז עָלָ֣ה הַ⁠שַּׁעַר֮	1	This clause introduces the next part of the story, in which Boaz takes the leading role as kinsman-redeemer and marries Ruth. Use your language’s way of introducing a new part of a story (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
4:1	m4by			הַ⁠שַּׁעַר֮	1	**to the gate of the city** or **to the gate of Bethlehem**. This was the main entrance to the walled town of Bethlehem. Inside the gate was an open area that was used as a meeting place to discuss community matters.
4:1	jdr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	The word **behold** alerts us to the important event of Boaz seeing the exact person whom he wanted to see walking by. Your language may also have a specific way of alerting someone to pay careful attention to what happens next in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
4:1	kz1g			הַ⁠גֹּאֵ֤ל	1	This was the closest living male relative to Elimelek. See how you translated **kinsman-redeemer** in [2:20](../02/20/zu5f).
4:1	ab38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּלֹנִ֣י אַלְמֹנִ֑י	1	Boaz did not actually say these words; instead, he called the kinsman-redeemer by his name. This is an idiom that means that this is a specific person but the name is not given. The narrator has substituted this general term for the person’s name either because the specific name is not important for the story or the man’s name had been forgotten. If your language has an idiom to refer to a specific person without using his name, use that here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]).
4:1	ab39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	פְּלֹנִ֣י אַלְמֹנִ֑י	1	In many languages, this is an awkward and unnatural way for someone to address another person. A way to make this more natural could be to turn this into an indirect quotation as in the UST. A combination of indirect and direct quotation is also possible: “Boaz called him by name, and said, ‘Turn aside and sit down here.’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]).
4:2	ab40			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֞ח עֲשָׂרָ֧ה אֲנָשִׁ֛ים	1	**Then he chose ten men**

4:4	c6xi			נֶ֥גֶד	1	**in the presence of**. Having these men as witnesses would make the transaction legal and binding.
4:4	lgq1			גְּאָ֔ל	1	**redeem** means to buy the land to keep it within the family.

If that is so in your language, see the UST for a way that is more clear. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
4:4	u548			וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֖י אַחֲרֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Boaz was the next nearest kinsman to Elimelek, and so had the second right to redeem the land.
4:5	ut23			בְּ⁠יוֹם־קְנוֹתְ⁠ךָ֥ & וּ֠⁠מֵ⁠אֵת & קָנִ֔יתָה	1	Boaz uses this expression to inform his relative of the additional responsibility he will have if he buys the land. Alternate translation: “When you buy the land, you also get”
4:5	ymn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד נָעֳמִ֑י	1	Here the word **hand** represents Naomi, who owns the field. Alternate translation: “from Naomi” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:5	dya3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ֠⁠מֵ⁠אֵת ר֣וּת & קָנִ֔יתָה	1	**you must also marry Ruth** (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

4:5	ab43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הַ⁠מֵּ֖ת	1	Ruth’s husband was **the dead**. This can be stated differently to avoid the nominal adjective **the dead**. Alternate translation: “the man who died” or “her husband who died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
4:6	sx9k			אַשְׁחִ֖ית אֶת־נַחֲלָתִ֑⁠י	1	The man would need to give some of his wealth in exchange for the property. Then if he were to marry Ruth, that property would belong to her son, not to his own children. In that way, he would be taking away from the wealth that his own children would inherit from him and giving it instead to the children that Ruth might bear. Alternate translation: “taking away from my own children’s inheritance.”
4:6	sa7h			גְּאַל־לְ⁠ךָ֤ אַתָּה֙ אֶת־גְּאֻלָּתִ֔⁠י	1	**You yourself redeem it instead of me**
4:7	wga9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠זֹאת֩	1	**Now this was the custom**. The writer of the book stops telling the story in order to give some background information that explains the custom of exchange during the time of Ruth. Use your language’s way of giving background information in a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
4:7	lgf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	לְ⁠פָנִ֨ים	1	**in earlier times** or **long ago**. This implies that this custom was no longer practiced when the book of Ruth was written. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
4:7	d46w			לְ⁠רֵעֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	**to his friend**. This refers to the person with whom he was making the agreement. In this situation the near kinsman gave Boaz his sandal.
4:8	ab44			וַ⁠יֹּ֧אמֶר הַ⁠גֹּאֵ֛ל	1	The events of the story start again here after the background information of verse 7. Use your language’s way of starting to tell the events of the story again.

4:9	lwx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יַּ֖ד נָעֳמִֽי	1	The hand of Naomi represents Naomi. Since her husband and sons had died, the right to the property belonged to her. Alternate translation: “from Naomi” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:9	img5			כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֶֽ⁠אֱלִימֶ֔לֶךְ וְ⁠אֵ֛ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠כִלְי֖וֹן וּ⁠מַחְל֑וֹן	1	This refers to all the land and possessions of Naomi’s dead husband and sons.
4:10	jdr0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠גַ֣ם	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThis connecting phrase indicates that the people sitting at the gate are witnesses to the fact that Boaz is buying back Elimelek’s family land for Naomi (4:9) and also to the fact that Boaz is claiming Ruth to be his wife (4:10). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:10	nm32			לְ⁠הָקִ֤ים שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֵּת֙ עַל־נַ֣חֲלָת֔⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated this phrase in 4:5. Alternate translation: “so that I might give her a son who will inherit the dead man’s property”

4:11	hg6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠בָּאָ֣ה אֶל־בֵּיתֶ֗⁠ךָ	1	This has both a literal and a figurative meaning. As Ruth marries Boaz, she will move into his house. “House” can be a metonym the represents “family,” so this also refers to becoming part of Boaz’s family by being his wife. Alternate translation: “who is becoming part of your family” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

The second phrase repeats somewhat and adds to the meaning of the first. This is a Hebrew style of emphasis. Alternate translation: “May you do good things in Bethlehem and become well-known for them.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]]).
4:11	ab65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וַ⁠עֲשֵׂה־חַ֣יִל בְּ⁠אֶפְרָ֔תָה וּ⁠קְרָא־שֵׁ֖ם בְּ⁠בֵ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	These phrases are a form of blessing.

4:11	uk9q			וַ⁠עֲשֵׂה־חַ֣יִל בְּ⁠אֶפְרָ֔תָה	1	The area around the town of Bethlehem was known as Ephrathah, and that became another name for the town. Presumably this name came from the Israelite clan that settled in and around the city of Bethlehem.

It does not imply any form of violence. Along with the following phrase, it simply means, **So Boaz married Ruth** or **So Boaz took Ruth as a wife**. Use a connecting word (like “so”) that indicates that this action by Boaz is a result of the agreement in verse 10. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

If it makes more sense to put the reason first, then follow the order in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:15	rpc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ט֣וֹבָה לָ֔⁠ךְ מִ⁠שִּׁבְעָ֖ה בָּנִֽים	1	**seven** represented the idea of completeness or perfection.
