While traveling, the Israelites became discouraged. So they rebelled against the leaders whom God had given them. At the Jordan River, the people of Israel refused to enter the Promised Land. Because the Israelites were afraid and did not trust God, he delayed their entry into the Promised Land for forty years (13:1–14:45). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe title of this book, “Numbers,” refers to when the number of the Israelites was counted. The people of the project language may already be familiar with the name “Numbers” from other Bible versions. If not, the translator could consider a clearer name for the book, such as “The Counting of the People of Israel.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/census]])\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Numbers?\n\nThe writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being very involved with writing the Book of Numbers. However, at a later time, scribes and priests probably put the book into its present form. They may have included text from other sources. One such source was “the scroll of the Wars of Yahweh” (21:14).\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How does Numbers present the idea of the whole community being responsible when only a few people sinned?\n\nThe people understood and assumed that God would punish the whole community of Israel if some of the people rebelled against him. God did often punish the entire nation when some of them sinned. All of the people in the ancient Near East would have understood and expected this. However, Moses and Aaron prayed for God to punish only those who were guilty.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Why does Moses speak using third person pronouns about himself?\n\nWhen an author wrote about something he was involved in, it was common for him to use the pronoun “he” instead of “I,” or “they” instead of “we.” The translator may decide to use the project’s normal pronouns instead.

15:intro	s9dr				0	# Numbers 15 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n### Purifying the people\nAs the people travel through the wilderness, Yahweh is purifying them. He is doing this so that they are able to enter into the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/purify]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Prostitution\n\nThe imagery of prostitution is commonly used in Scripture to indicate that Yahweh alone is to be worshiped. The people are compared to the prostitute because a husband is to only have a sexual relationship with his wife. Both the prostitute and the worship of other gods are violations of this exclusive relationship. Many cultures will struggle with this imagery because of a desire to use euphemisms.

So Moses told them to come to the sacred tent and burn incense to Yahweh. God then made the earth open and swallow up these leaders and their families. He also sent fire to destroy 250 other men who had joined with those leaders. These actions showed that only the Levites, those whom Yahweh appointed, could be priests. Also, it taught the people that to rebel against Yahweh’s anointed was to rebel against Yahweh.
