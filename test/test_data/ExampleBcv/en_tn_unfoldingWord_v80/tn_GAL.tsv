Paul declares his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ; he says that he is surprised by the false teachings that the Christians in Galatia have accepted from other people (1:1-10).\n1. Paul says that people are saved by trusting in Christ alone, not by keeping the law of Moses (1:11-2:21).\n1. God puts people right with himself only when they trust in Christ; the example of Abraham; the curse which the law brings (and not a means of salvation); slavery and freedom compared and illustrated by Hagar and Sarah (3:1-4:31).\n1. When people are joined to Christ, they become free from having to keep the law of Moses. They are also free to live as the Holy Spirit guides them. They are free to refuse the demands of sin. They are free to bear each other’s burdens (5:1-6:10).\n1. Paul warns the Christians not to trust in being circumcised and in keeping the law of Moses. Instead, they must trust in Christ (6:11-18).\n\n### Who wrote the book of Galatians?\n\nPaul wrote the book of Galatians. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he came to trust in Jesus Christ, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus and establishing churches.\n\nIt is uncertain when Paul wrote this letter and where he was when he wrote it. Some Bible scholars think Paul was in the city of Ephesus and wrote this letter after the second time he traveled to tell people about Jesus and establish churches. Other scholars think Paul was in the city of Antioch in Syria and wrote the letter soon after the first time he traveled.\n\n### What is the book of Galatians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to both Jewish and non-Jewish Christians in the region of Galatia. He wanted to write against the false teachers who said that Christians need to follow the law of Moses. Paul defended the gospel by explaining that Christians only need to believe in Jesus Christ, and they do not need to practice the law of Moses. In the book of Galatians Paul explains that people are saved as result of believing in Jesus and not as a result of obeying the law of Moses, and he proves this by using various Old Testament passages to illustrate this truth. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Galatians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Galatia.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What does it mean to “live like Jews” (2:14)?\n\nTo “live like Jews” means to obey the law of Moses, even though one trusts in Christ. The people who taught that it was necessary to follow the law of Moses in addition to believing in Jesus were called “Judaizers.”\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How did Paul use the terms “law” and “grace” in the book of Galatians?\n\nThese terms are used in a unique way in Galatians. There is an important teaching in Galatians about Christian living. Under the law of Moses, righteous or holy living required a person to obey a set of rules and regulations. As Christians, holy living is now motivated by grace and empowered by the Holy Spirit. This means that Christians have freedom in Christ and are not required to obey a specific set of rules. Instead, Christians are to live a holy life because they are thankful that God has been so kind to them. This is called “the law of Christ.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ” and “in Christ Jesus"?\n\nPaul uses the spatial metaphor “in Christ” or the related phrase “in Christ Jesus” very frequently in this letter. These expressions occur with metaphorical meaning in 1:22; 2:4,17; 3:14, 26, 28; and 5:6. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the people who believe in him. This metaphor emphasizes that believers are as closely united to Christ as if they were inside him. Paul believes that this is true for all believers. Sometimes he uses “in Christ” simply to identify that what he is speaking about is true for those who believe in Jesus. Other times, he emphasizes union with Christ as the means or the basis for some statement or exhortation. Sometimes when Paul uses the phrase “in Christ,” he intends a different meaning. See, for example, [2:16](../02/16.md), where Paul says “we also believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ” and see [2:17](../02/17.md) where Paul spoke of Christ being the object of faith when he said “seeking to be justified in Christ.” See the notes on specific verses for help in understanding the contextual meaning of “in Christ” and related phrases. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nPlease see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Galatians?\n* “Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes” (3:1)? The ULT, UST, and the other modern versions have this reading. However, older versions of the Bible add, “[so] that ye should not obey the truth.” Translators are advised not to include this expression. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have the passage, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to Galatians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	f3n5				0	# Galatians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nPaul started this letter differently than his other letters. He adds that he was an apostle “not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, the one having raised him from the dead.” Paul probably included these words because false teachers were opposing him and trying to undermine his authority.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Heresy\n\nGod eternally saves people only through the true, biblical gospel. God condemns any other version of the gospel. Paul asks God to curse those who teach a false gospel. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])\n\n### Paul’s qualifications\n\n\nSome people in the early church were teaching that Gentiles needed to obey the law of Moses. To refute this teaching, in verses 13-16 Paul explains that he was formerly a zealous Jew, but he still needed God to save him through believing in Jesus. As a Jew, and as the apostle to Gentile people, Paul was uniquely qualified to address this issue. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “You are turning so quickly to a different gospel”\n\nThe book of Galatians is one of Paul’s earliest letters in Scripture. It shows that heresies troubled even the early church. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:1	o4ns			Παῦλος	1	Here, Paul is introducing himself as the author of this letter. Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. Use that here. Alternate translation: “This letter is from me, Paul”
1:1	uhhp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Παῦλος	1	Paul is speaking of himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person. Alternate translation: “This letter is from me, Paul” or “I, Paul” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person)
1:1	m4ss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἀπ’ ἀνθρώπων, οὐδὲ δι’ ἀνθρώπου	1	If your readers would misunderstand this double negative, you could translate this phrase using only one negative word. Alternate translation: “not from men or through man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1:1	rcnw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἀπ’ ἀνθρώπων	1	Here, the word **from** indicates source. The phrase **not from men** means that humans are not the source of Paul’s apostleship and that he was not commissioned or appointed to be an apostle by human beings. If it would help your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “not sent out by people” or “not because I was appointed and sent by a group of people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:1	yqma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων & ἀνθρώπου	1	Although the terms **men** and **man** are masculine, Paul uses them here in a generic sense to refer to humans in general. Alternate translation: “humans … humans” or “people … a person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:1	k2dw			δι’ ἀνθρώπου, ἀλλὰ διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1	Both times that the word **through** is used in this verse it indicates agency or means and refers to the agency or means by which Paul’s was commissioned as an apostle. Choose the best word in your language to indicate the meaning of the word **through** here. Alternate translation: “through the agency of man, but through the agency of Jesus Christ and God the Father”
1:1	pvdp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	The word **but** introduces a contrast. Here, the word **but** introduces a contrast between different potential agents or means of Paul’s commission.  The contrast is between Paul’s apostleship being **not through man** but rather **through Jesus Christ and God the Father**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but rather” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1:1	fyu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	The phrase **the one having raised him from the dead** gives further information about **God the Father**. It is not making a distinction between **God the Father** and **the one having raised him from the dead** as if they are two separate entities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases more clear. Alternate translation: “God the Father, who is the same one who made Jesus Christ live again after he died” or “God the Father, who caused Jesus Christ to live again after he had died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1:1	wmlj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1	Here, the phrase **the Father** could be (1) a general title for God which identifies him as the first person in the Christian Trinity. If you choose this option, then you should not define whose **Father** God is in your translation but, rather, you should use a general expression like the ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]]) (2) referring to God’s relationship to those who believe in Christ. Alternate translation: “God our Father”
1:1	w3gr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “from among the people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:1	g5as		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Here, the phrase **the dead** could be a figurative way of referring to a place, in which case it would be referring to “the place of the dead” or “the realm of the dead.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “from the place of the dead” or “from the realm of the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:2	d737		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Here, although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using it in a generic sense to refer to fellow Christians, both men and women. Paul views all those who believe in Jesus as members of one spiritual family with God as their heavenly Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate explicitly what it means. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:2	wmd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Γαλατίας	1	Here, the word **Galatia** could refer to: (1) the Roman political province called **Galatia**. Alternate translation: “in the province of Galatia” or (2) the geographical region known as **Galatia**. Alternate translation: “in the region of Galatia” If it would help your readers, you could state explicitly what the word **Galatia** refers to here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:2	aa9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς Γαλατίας	1	Paul uses the possessive form here to describe churches that are in Roman political province called **Galatia** or in the geographical region known as **Galatia**. If this use of the possessive form is not clear in your language, you could clarify the meaning using a form that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “in the province of Galatia” or “in the region of Galatia” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:3	nxtz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	This is a common blessing that Paul often uses in the beginning of his letters. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:3	psjz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **Grace** and **peace**, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **grace** and **peace** with adjectives such as “gracious” and “peaceful.” Alternate translation: “May God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ be gracious to you and make you peaceful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:3	nykr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	Here, the word **you** is plural and refers to the Galatians. Unless noted otherwise, all instances of “you” and “your” in this letter refer to the Galatians and are plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:4	onj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	τοῦ δόντος ἑαυτὸν περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν, ὅπως ἐξέληται ἡμᾶς ἐκ τοῦ αἰῶνος τοῦ ἐνεστῶτος πονηροῦ	1	The phrase **the one having given himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from the present evil age** gives us further information about “our Lord Jesus Christ” mentioned at the end of [1:3](../01/03.md). It is not making a distinction. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “who is the one having given himself for our sins so that he might deliver us from the present evil age” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1:4	yk9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	περὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν	1	Here, **sins** figuratively refers to the punishment for sin.

1:4	f2pm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμῶν	1	Both uses of **our** in this verse are inclusive. See the note on **our** in [1:3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:4	haib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sins**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as "sinful," or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:4	d8m2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ὅπως	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which Christ gave himself for our sins. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:4	f6d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ τοῦ αἰῶνος τοῦ ἐνεστῶτος πονηροῦ	1	Here, the phrase **the present evil age** refers not only to a time period but also to the sinful attitudes and actions that characterize **the present evil age**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “from this present time that is dominated by sinfulness” or “from the evil powers at work in the world today” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:4	mg01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1	The phrase **and Father** gives further information about **our God**.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:5	miju		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	ἀμήν	1	**Amen** is a Hebrew word. Paul spelled it out using Greek letters so his readers would know how it sounded. He assumes that they know that it means “so be it” or “yes indeed.” In your translation, you can spell it the way it sounds in your language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could also explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “Amen, which means, ‘So be it!’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

1:6	ficf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετατίθεσθε	1	The phrase **you are turning away** is in the present tense and is portraying the action of **turning away** as being in process, but not yet completed. Make sure that you express this phrase in your language in a way that shows that the Galatians **turning away** is currently happening, but not complete. (Paul is writing this letter in order to encourage the Galatians not to turn away to **a different gospel**).
1:6	cw1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὕτως ταχέως	1	Here, the phrase **so quickly** means that the Galatians were turning away from faith in the true gospel shortly after they accepted it. If it would help your readers, you could express that explicitly.

Alternate translation: “graciously because of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:6	cizk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάριτι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as "kindness," or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:7	l5ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἄλλο	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “another gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:7	rg69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	εἰ μή τινές εἰσιν οἱ ταράσσοντες ὑμᾶς, καὶ θέλοντες μεταστρέψαι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If, in your language, the use of the word **except** makes it appear as though Paul is making a statement and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “but certain people are causing you trouble and want to pervert the gospel of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
1:7	wnfe			τινές & οἱ	1	Alternate translation: “certain people”
1:7	kswu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ταράσσοντες ὑμᾶς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **trouble**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form such as "troubling," or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “the gospel about Christ” (2) designate Christ as the one who proclaimed the gospel message to which he is referring, in which case Paul is referring to the gospel message that Christ preached. Alternate translation: “the gospel that Christ proclaimed” or “the gospel that Christ preached” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

Paul uses a hypothetical situation to warn the Galatians against any teaching that is contrary to the original gospel message which he taught them. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “if it were to happen that we or an angel from heaven might proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you, let whoever would do that be cursed” or “suppose it were to happen that we or an angel from heaven might proclaim to you a gospel other than the one we proclaimed to you. Let whoever would do that be cursed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1:8	wnx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & εὐηγγελισάμεθα	1	When Paul says **we** here, he is not including the Galatians, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

IIf it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “different from the gospel we proclaimed” or “different from the message we proclaimed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:8	xb2c			ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1	If your language has a common way of asking God to curse someone or of calling down a curse on someone, and it would be appropriate to use in this context, consider using it here.
1:8	kv9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of someone being **cursed**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form such as “curse.” Alternate translation: “let God curse him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:8	pifk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “let God curse him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:8	g7zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1	Although the term **him** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “let God curse that person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

1:10	b2vc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἄρτι γὰρ ἀνθρώπους πείθω ἢ τὸν Θεόν? ἢ ζητῶ ἀνθρώποις ἀρέσκειν	1	By using these two rhetorical questions, Paul is not asking the Galatians for information, but is using the question form for emphasis and to engage his readers' thinking. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “For I do not seek to persuade men, but instead I only seek the approval of God!

Paul is using a hypothetical situation to teach the Galatians. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a hypothetical situation, or if it would help your readers, you could state Paul’s meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “I am not still pleasing men, because I am a servant of Christ” or “If I were still pleasing people, then I would not be serving Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])

Use a form that would be natural for introducing a statement which gives supporting evidence. Alternate translation: “In support of my claim that the gospel I proclaimed is not according to man, I want you to know that” (2) a statement which explains and builds on Paul’s assertion in [1:11](../01/11.md).

If saying the same thing twice might confuse your readers, you could combine the two phrases into one. Alternate translation: “I did not receive the gospel that I proclaim from any person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:12	er9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπου	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women and refers to humans.

1:12	g1o6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	What follows the word **but** is in contrast to the phrases **receive it from man** and **taught it**.

1:12	wed1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	δι’ ἀποκαλύψεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Paul could be using the possessive form here to mean: (1) that God revealed Jesus Christ to Paul. See the phrase “to reveal his Son in me” in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “God revealed Jesus Christ to me” or “God made me know the gospel when he showed Jesus Christ to me” (2) that it was Jesus Christ who made the revelation to Paul.

1:15	w6zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	What follows the word **But** here is in contrast to what was expected. What would be expected is that Paul would continue thinking and acting according to the way he formerly did, as he described in [1:14](../01/14.md). Instead, God **called** Paul, and as the next verse says, God revealed Jesus to him so that he might teach the Gentiles about Jesus. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast.

2:intro	xe28				0	# Galatians 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nPaul continues to defend the true gospel. This defense began in [Galatians 1:11](../../gal/01/11.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Freedom and slavery\n\nThroughout this letter, Paul contrasts freedom and slavery. Paul describes trying to follow the law of Moses as a type of slavery. The Christian is free in Christ from being under the authority of the law of Moses and from the condemnation that the law of Moses brings. The Christian, through union with Christ in his death and resurrection, had by believing in Christ, is set free from the penalty and power of sin. The Christian is empowered by the Spirit to live a life of spiritual freedom and obedience to God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “I do not negate the grace of God”\n\nPaul teaches that if a Christian attempts to follow the law of Moses to obtain righteousness, that person does not understand the grace which God has shown to them through the work of Christ. This is a fundamental error. Paul uses the words “I do not negate the grace of God” as a type of hypothetical situation. The purpose of this statement could be seen as, “If you could be saved by following the law, then it would negate the grace of God.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])\n\n\n### “the law”\n\nThe phrase “the law” contains a singular noun that refers to a group of laws that God gave Israel by dictating them to Moses. This phrase occurs in chapters 2-5, and quite frequently in chapters 2 and 3. Every time this phrase occurs in Galatians, it refers to the group of laws that God dictated to Moses at Mount Sinai. You should translate this phrase the same way each time it occurs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

2:2	g384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνεθέμην αὐτοῖς	1	Here, the phrase **set before** means to communicate something to someone for the purpose of receiving their opinion regarding it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “communicated to them” or “related to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:2	rhps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	αὐτοῖς	1	Most Bible scholars think that **them** here refers to meetings with two different groups of people with whom Paul met while in Jerusalem, one meeting with a large number of Christians from Jerusalem and a smaller meeting with just the apostles. The phrase **but privately to the ones seeming to be important** is only describing the latter meeting, as it is only this meeting which is relevant to what Paul is trying to communicate here. When translating the word **them**, make sure that you use a word or phrase that allows for both meetings to be included. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:2	ypg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	κατ’ ἰδίαν δὲ τοῖς	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “but privately I set it before the ones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:2	msv4			τοῖς δοκοῦσιν	1	Alternate translation: “to the men who seemed to be influential” or “to those who were recognized as leaders of the believers in Jerusalem” or “to those who were leaders of the church in Jerusalem”
2:2	t6we			μή πως εἰς κενὸν τρέχω ἢ ἔδραμον	1	Alternate translation: “to ensure I was doing profitable work”
2:2	ik4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μή πως εἰς κενὸν τρέχω ἢ ἔδραμον	1	By saying **lest I might run—or had run—in vain** Paul is not expressing doubt regarding the validity or accuracy of the message about Jesus that he preached. Rather, he is referring to the possibility that if the apostles of Jesus were to publicly disagree with his message, then it would or could cause people to no longer believe it, in which case his work of teaching people the message about Jesus would or could have no lasting results. Translate this phrase in a way that avoids making it appear as if Paul is questioning the content or validity of the message he proclaims. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate more explicitly what this phrase means. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:2	ejb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τρέχω ἢ ἔδραμον	1	Here, Paul uses the word **run** to mean work. Paul specifically means working for the advancement of the gospel. Paul uses the word **run** to bring to the Galatians’ minds the image of a runner who is running a race in order to win a prize. If this image is familiar to people in your culture, consider using this metaphor. If this image is not familiar to your readers, consider stating this idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “I might work for the advancement of the gospel—or had worked” or “I might work for the spread of the good news—or had worked for it” ( See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:2	svvy			εἰς κενὸν	1	Alternate translation: “for no purpose” or “without positive results” or “for nothing”
2:3	wyrr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	Here, the word **But** is introducing an idea that is in contrast to an idea that was presented in [2:2](../02/02.md). Paul is probably presenting the fact that **not even Titus … was forced to be circumcised** as being in contrast to the idea in [2:2](../02/02.md) that he might have “run in vain” (labored in vain). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “On the contrary,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]]
2:3	ybww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	οὐδὲ Τίτος ὁ σὺν ἐμοί, Ἕλλην ὤν	1	The phrase **the one with me** and the phrase **being a Greek** both give further information about **Titus**. Neither of these phrases is making a distinction between **Titus** and some other person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “not even Titus, my non-Jewish ministry partner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
2:3	xs8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲ Τίτος ὁ σὺν ἐμοί, Ἕλλην ὤν, ἠναγκάσθη περιτμηθῆναι	1	The phrase **was forced to be circumcised** is passive. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the leaders of the church in Jerusalem did not even require my Greek ministry partner, Titus, to be circumcised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:4	kwoz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ δὲ	1	The word **But** could: (1) be connected to [2:3](../02/03.md) and be giving the reason why some people were demanding that Titus be circumcised. Alternate translation: “But this issue occurred because of” (2) be connected to [2:1-2](../02/01.md) and be giving the reason why Paul “went up again to Jerusalem” and privately “set before” (communicated to) the church leaders in Jerusalem the gospel that he proclaimed among the Gentiles. Alternate translation: “But I talked to them privately because of” or “But we went to Jerusalem because of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	j5ka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρεισάκτους ψευδαδέλφους, οἵτινες παρεισῆλθον κατασκοπῆσαι	1	Using the phrase **false brothers**, Paul speaks of these people as if they were spies with bad motives. He means that they pretended to be fellow believers, but their intent was to observe what Paul and the other believers were doing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “people who pretended to be Christians, who came into our midst in order to watch us closely” or “people who said they were Christians but were not, who came into our group to view closely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	jx0q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρεισάκτους	1	In the original language in which Paul wrote this letter, the word which the ULT translates as **brought in**, could mean: (1) that these **false brothers** were invited in by someone. Alternate translation: “secretly invited” or (2) that they came into the midst of the believers by their own initiative. Alternate translation: “deceptive coming of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	fpkc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ψευδαδέλφους	1	Here, the word **brothers** does not refer to biological brothers but to believers in Jesus. The phrase **false brothers** refers to those who only pretended to be fellow believers in Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	etlo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατασκοπῆσαι τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἡμῶν, ἣν ἔχομεν ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **freedom**, you could express the same idea with with a verb such as **freed** or an adjective such as “free.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	lyqj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἔχομεν	1	When Paul says **we**, he is speaking of himself, his traveling companions, and the Galatian believers, so **we** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:4	uvjw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union that believers have with Christ. See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3: Important Translation Issues in the Introduction to Galatians section. If it would help your readers you could use a fuller phrase to describe Paul’s meaning. Alternate translation: “in union with Christ Jesus” or “through our union with Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	v9fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which the **false brothers** spied on their freedom, which was for the purpose of wanting to **enslave** them. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:4	l7n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα ἡμᾶς καταδουλώσουσιν	1	Paul is speaking about how these people wanted to force the Galatian believers to follow the Jewish rituals that the law commanded. He is speaking about following the law as if it were slavery. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to force us to obey the law” or “in order to make us slaves to the law” [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	pow3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	εἴξαμεν	1	When Paul says **we**, he is not including the Galatian believers, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:5	w6dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἷς οὐδὲ & εἴξαμεν τῇ ὑποταγῇ	1	Here, to **not … yield in submission** means to not agree with and comply with the demands of the people who said that Titus needed to be circumcised. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “we did not give in to their demands” or “we did not comply with what they wanted us to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:5	bba7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἴξαμεν τῇ ὑποταγῇ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **submission**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:5	smpn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὥραν	1	Here, the phrase **an hour** refers to a short period of time. If you have an equivalent expression in your culture, you could use that, or if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate Paul’s meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “a short period of time” or “a short amount of time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:5	a3hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which Paul and his ministry partners **did not even yield in submission** to those who taught that circumcision was necessary. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:5	k61r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἀλήθεια τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as "true" or "correct," or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:5	bqqq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ ἀλήθεια τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	Here, the possessive form is used to describe the **truth** that belongs to and is contained within **the gospel** message. It is also being used to contrast the genuine and correct gospel with false gospels such as the one Paul is refuting in this letter. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify the relationship for your readers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:6	xcdh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, Paul uses the word **But** to introduce something that is in contrast to what the false brothers in [2:4](../02/04.md) wanted to do. The false brothers wanted to enslave the believers by adding the requirement of circumcision to the gospel message. Beginning in this verse and continuing in [2:6-10](../02/06.md), Paul explains that, in contrast to the actions of the false brothers, the leaders of the church in Jerusalem did not require that Paul add anything to the content of his gospel message. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Rather” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]]
2:6	rfvs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν δοκούντων εἶναί τι	1	The phrase **the ones seeming to be something** implies the word “important” and is very similar in meaning to the phrase **the ones seeming important** at the end of this verse. If it would help your readers, you could express the implied word explicitly. Alternate translation: “the ones seeming to be something important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:6	flz3			ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν, οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει, πρόσωπον ὁ Θεὸς ἀνθρώπου οὐ λαμβάνει	1	The statement **what sort they were formerly matters nothing to me; God does not accept the face of man** is a parenthetical statement. Use a natural form in your language for introducing and/or expressing a parenthetical statement.
2:6	zrw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁποῖοί	1	The phrase **what sort** implies the words “of people.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “what sort of people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:6	st6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν, οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει	1	The phrase **what sort they were formerly matters nothing to me** does not mean that Paul did not regard these people’s character as important but, rather, it means that he did not let their status or position influence his decision making. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:6	c9xx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρόσωπον ὁ Θεὸς ἀνθρώπου οὐ λαμβάνει	1	Here, the term **face** means “external status and position.” The phrase **God does not accept the face of man** is an idiom which means that God does not base his judgements and decisions on appearances or external factors. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “God does not judge with partiality” or “God does not look at external factors when making decisions” or “God does not show partiality” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

2:7	l5m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰδόντες	1	Here, the phrase **having seen** means “having understood.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as "graciously" or "kindly," or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “having understood the task that God had graciously given to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Use a natural way in your language for introducing a reason. If it would be more natural in your language to state the reason for an action before giving the result, see the note for [2:11](../02/11.md) on creating a verse bridge.

2:12	z1kg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φοβούμενος τοὺς ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	If it would help your readers the reason Peter was **afraid** can be stated explicitly. See [6:12](../06/12.md) where Paul says that those trying to compel the Galatian believers were doing so because they did not want to be persecuted. Alternate translation: “being afraid that the unbelieving Jews might persecute him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:12	fy79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοὺς ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	See how you translated the phrase **the circumcision** in [2:7](../02/07.md). Here, the term **the circumcision** probably refers specifically to Jews who were not believers in Jesus, since it is unlikely that Peter would have feared Jewish Christians or the men whom James sent. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:13	urwh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ λοιποὶ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Here, the phrase **the rest of the Jews** refers only to the other Jewish believers who were in Antioch. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	nkrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the result of the hypocritical actions of Cephas (see [2:12](../02/12.md)) and **the rest of the Jews** who **joined with him**. The result was that **Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a result. Alternate translation: “with the result that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:13	iau6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συναπήχθη αὐτῶν τῇ ὑποκρίσει	1	Here, the phrase **led astray** means to influence or convince someone to think and act in a wrong way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “was influenced by their hypocritical behavior” or “was influenced by their hypocritical behavior so that he also acted hypocritically” or “was influenced by their hypocritical behavior so that he also joined them in acting hypocritically” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	v4cj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ Βαρναβᾶς συναπήχθη αὐτῶν τῇ ὑποκρίσει	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they even led Barnabas astray by their hypocrisy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:13	vmkj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	αὐτῶν τῇ ὑποκρίσει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hypocrisy**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as "hypocritical," or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “by their hypocritical behavior” or “by their hypocritical actions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:14	k16c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	Here, Paul uses the word **But** to introduce a contrast between his actions and the wrong actions of Cephas, Barnabas, and the other Jewish believers that he described in [2:12-13](../02/12.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:14	sg53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ὀρθοποδοῦσιν	1	Here, the word **walking** is a figure of speech which refers to how people act or conduct their lives. In Jewish culture a person’s behavior was spoken of as if that person was walking along a path. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning using plain language. Alternate translation: “they were not acting correctly” or “they were not conducting their lives correctly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:14	va3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀλήθειαν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in some other way that is natural in your language. See how you translated the phrase **the truth of the gospel** in [2:5](../02/05.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:14	s978		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	εἰ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος, ὑπάρχων ἐθνικῶς καὶ οὐκ Ἰουδαϊκῶς ζῇς, πῶς τὰ ἔθνη ἀναγκάζεις Ἰουδαΐζειν	1	This is the beginning of a direct quotation in which Paul quotes what he **said to Cephas**. Some Bible scholars think this quote ends at the end of this verse, while other Bible scholars think that this quotation continues until the end of [2:21](../02/21.md). Some Bible scholars think that part of Paul’s words in [2:15-21](../02/15.md) could be him summarizing what he said to Peter and the Jews who were present. The ULT uses quotation marks from this point through the end of [2:21](../02/21.md). Use a natural way in your language for indicating that Paul’s words from here to the end of [2:21](../02/21.md) are a quotation. If you decide that Paul is  quoting himself only through the end of this verse, then use a natural way in your language for indicating that Paul’s words from here to the end of this verse are the complete, direct quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
2:14	z4fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	εἰ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος, ὑπάρχων ἐθνικῶς καὶ οὐκ Ἰουδαϊκῶς ζῇς, πῶς τὰ ἔθνη ἀναγκάζεις Ἰουδαΐζειν	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphatically rebuke Cephas and to help Cephas understand the hypocrisy of his actions. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation, and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are a Jew, and live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, and so it is very hypocritical for you to force the Gentiles to live like Jews!” or “You are a Jew, and live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, and so it is very wrong for you to force the Gentiles to live like Jews!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:14	qlzt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος, ὑπάρχων ἐθνικῶς καὶ οὐκ Ἰουδαϊκῶς ζῇς	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile and not a like Jew” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2:14	ish9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σὺ & ἀναγκάζεις	1	Both occurrences of the word **you** in this verse refer to Peter and are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2:15	vjsh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	When Paul says **We**, it could be: (1) inclusive if Paul is still addressing Peter. If you decide that this verse is a continuation of the quotation that began in [2:14](../02/14.md), then **We** is inclusive because Paul is still addressing Peter and would be including Peter and the Jewish Christians in Antioch. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (2) exclusive if you decide that Paul’s quotation of his words to Peter ended at the end [2:14](../02/14.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:15	tzxo			ἡμεῖς φύσει Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί	1	Alternate translation: “We had Jewish parents and are not Gentiles”
2:15	tz45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί	1	The word **sinners** was used by Jews as a synonym for non-Jews because non-Jews did not have or adhere to the law of Moses. Paul is not saying that only non-Jewish people are **sinners**. The rest of this letter will make clear that both Jews and non-Jews are sinners and need God’s forgiveness. If it would help your readers, you could indicate explicitly that the term **sinners** is what Jews called non-Jews. Alternatively, you could state the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “non-Jews who do not have or follow the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:16	vduo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to what would be naturally be expected by a Jewish person in view of [2:15](../02/15.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “nevertheless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:16	y3tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “person” or “human being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:16	xhx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ δικαιοῦται ἄνθρωπος & δικαιωθῶμεν & δικαιωθήσεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God justifies no man … God might justify us … will God justify” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:16	s2ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἔργων νόμου	-1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe the types of **works** to which he is referring. He is specifically referring to works of the Mosaic law. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify the relationship for your readers. Alternate translation: “doing the works that are commanded in the law of Moses … doing the things commanded in the law of Moses … doing the things commanded in the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:16	purc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔργων νόμου	-1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **works**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form or in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: "obeying the law … doing what the law says … obeying the law" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:16	xgjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	νόμου & νόμου & νόμου	1	Here, **the law** is a singular noun that refers to a group of laws that God gave Israel by dictating them to Moses. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you could use a different expression. See how you translated the phrase **the law** in [Romans 2:12](../rom/02/12.md). Alternate translation: “of God’s laws … of God's laws … of God's laws” or “of the laws God gave Moses … of the laws God gave Moses … of the laws God gave Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
2:16	ncnt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	ἐὰν μὴ	1	If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “but rather, only” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
2:16	iivr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πίστεως	-1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a such as believing or trusts, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:16	q4iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & δικαιωθῶμεν	1	When Paul says **we** it could be: (1) inclusive if Paul is still addressing Peter. If you decide that this verse is a continuation of the quotation that began in [2:14](../02/14.md), then **we** is inclusive both times that it occurs in this verse, because Paul is still addressing Peter and would be including Peter and the Jewish Christians in Antioch. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (2) exclusive if you decide that Paul’s quotation of his words to Peter ended at the end [2:14](../02/14.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:16	nzcb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is introducing the purpose for which he and the other Jewish believers **believed in Christ Jesus**, which is **so that** they **might be justified by faith in Christ**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:16	gp4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι ἐξ ἔργων νόμου, οὐ δικαιωθήσεται πᾶσα σάρξ	1	Here, the word **For** re-introduces and re-states the reason why Cephas and the other Jewish believers **believed in Christ Jesus**. They **believed in Jesus Christ** because **by works of the law no flesh will be justified**. The phrase **by works of the law no flesh will be justified** repeats in slightly different words the earlier phrase in the verse which says **no man is justified by works of the law**. If it would not be natural in your language to re-introduce the reason after the result, you could re-introduce and re-state the result. Alternate translation: “We believed in Christ Jesus because no flesh will be justified by works of the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:16	j7g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πᾶσα σάρξ	1	The word **flesh** refers to human beings. Paul uses a part of the human body to refer to the entire human. The phrase **any flesh** means any person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “any person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:16	ctbj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	οὐ & ἄνθρωπος & πᾶσα σάρξ	1	Both the words **man** and **flesh** refer to people in general and include all people, both Jewish people and Gentile people, and refer to people of all ages and ethnicities. The phrases **no man** and **any flesh** exclude all people, both Jewish people and Gentile people. Paul is saying the same thing in two different ways to emphasize that no person, Jew or Gentile, can be justified by obeying the law. Since Paul explains this truth in this passage, you do not need to explain its meaning further here, but make sure to use words or phrases when translating the words “man” and “flesh” which indicate that these words refer to all people of all ages and ethnicities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:17	gf9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here Paul uses the word **But** to introduce new information into his ongoing explanation of why justification is through faith in Christ and not through obeying the law of Moses. Here, Paul is anticipating and answering a possible objection to justification by faith. The word **But** introduces this. Use a natural form in your language for doing this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:17	gtu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2:17	vnp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν Χριστῷ	1	The phrase **justified in Christ** means “made righteous in God’s sight because of being united with Christ by believing in what he has done.” This phrase means the same thing as the phrase justified by faith in Christ in [2:16](../02/16.md). See how you translated the phrase “justified by faith in Christ” there and, if it would help your readers, consider stating more fully here what the phrase **to be justified in Christ** means. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	m0tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δικαιωθῆναι ἐν Χριστῷ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that God will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to justify us through our faith in Christ” or “for God to justify us because of our faith in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:17	s2r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	εὑρέθημεν	1	Here, **we** could be: (1) inclusive if Paul is still addressing Peter. If you decide that this verse is a continuation of the quotation that began in [2:14](../02/14.md) then **we** is inclusive because Paul is still addressing Peter and would be including Peter and the Jewish Christians in Antioch. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (2) exclusive if you decide that Paul’s quotation of his words to Peter ended at the end [2:14](../02/14.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:17	mg0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ	1	Paul uses the word **ourselves** for emphasis. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
2:17	ph83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὑρέθημεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἁμαρτωλοί	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:17	c1op		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἁμαρτωλοί & ἁμαρτίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sin** or being a sinner, you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:17	qw76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἆρα Χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος	1	The phrase **is Christ then a minister of sin** is a rhetorical question. Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:17	yy9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	μὴ γένοιτο	1	The expression **May it never be** gives the strongest possible negative answer to the preceding rhetorical question **is Christ a minister of sin**? Use a natural way in your language for strongly and emphatically negating an idea. Alternate translation: “Of course, that is not true” or “No, never” or “No way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
2:18	mwuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἃ κατέλυσα, ταῦτα πάλιν οἰκοδομῶ, παραβάτην ἐμαυτὸν συνιστάνω	1	Paul speaks of no longer thinking it is necessary to obey all the laws of Moses as if he were destroying the law of Moses. When he speaks of rebuilding **those things**, he is referring to going back again to acting like and teaching that it is necessary to keep the laws of Moses. Paul is saying in this verse that he would be sinning if he **again** tried to go back to living as if it were necessary to obey the laws of Moses after becoming convinced that it was not necessary to obey them in order to please God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly, or you could use a simile. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:18	o7g8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	παραβάτην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **a transgressor**, you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “behaving sinfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:19	wdaa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** is introducing the reason that Paul said "May it never be” in [2:17](../02/17.md) and is also introducing information which gives support for what he said in [2:18](../02/18.md). Use a natural form for introducing a reason for something had been said. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:19	zqqw			διὰ νόμου	1	Alternate translation: “by means of the law”
2:19	oh0f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	διὰ νόμου νόμῳ	1	See how you translated the phrase **the law** in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “through God’s laws … to those laws” or “through the laws God gave Moses  … to those laws” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
2:19	r55d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	νόμῳ ἀπέθανον	1	Here, the phrase, **died to the law** could: (1) be a metaphor in which **died to the law** refers to Paul’s new relationship to the law of Moses which he experienced when he realized that trying to obey the law of Moses was not a valid way of earning God’s approval; and as a result he chose to die to the law, by which he means he was released from the power and control of the law of Moses and no longer subjected himself to it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “died to being under the control of the law and am no longer subject to it” or “stopped being subject to the authority of the law of Moses” (2) be a metaphor in which the phrase **died to the law** means “considered as dead to the requirements of the law of Moses through union with Christ.” The phrase **died to the law** would then refer to believers’ vicarious death with Christ through their believing in him and their consequent union with him which they have as a result of their faith in him. (See [Rom 7:4](../07/04.md) and [Gal 4:4-5](../04/04.md)) Alternate translation: “died to the requirements of the law through my union with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:19	v3t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	νόμου νόμῳ	1	See how you translated the phrase **the law** in [2:16](../02/016.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
2:19	yl7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is introducing the purpose or reason for which he **died to the law**. The purpose was **so that** he **might live to God**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:19	l3r9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεῷ ζήσω	1	The phrase **live to God** means “live for God.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I might live for God” or “I might live to honor God” or “I might live to please God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:19	xg5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Χριστῷ συνεσταύρωμαι	1	The phrase **I have been crucified with Christ** is a metaphor. Paul is not saying that he literally died with Christ. Paul is using this metaphor to express the reality that, as a result of his faith in Christ and the subsequent union with Christ that his faith has brought about, God now views Paul as if he had died with Christ on the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:19	fh2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Χριστῷ συνεσταύρωμαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that the law was the reason Christ had to be put to death. Roman soldiers put Jesus to death, but in context Paul is explaining that it was God’s righteous requirements given in the law that made it necessary for Christ to die so that people could be forgiven. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:20	o3jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζῶ & οὐκέτι ἐγώ, ζῇ δὲ ἐν ἐμοὶ Χριστός	1	Here, the phrase **I no longer live, but Christ lives in me** is a metaphor which means that Paul no longer lives for himself and his own self-motivated purposes and desires, but rather, he now lets Christ’s will direct his actions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or you could express the meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	y2qf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὃ & νῦν ζῶ	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “that life which I now live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:20	yklz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὃ & νῦν ζῶ ἐν σαρκί, ἐν πίστει ζῶ	1	Here, when Paul refers to the life he lives in his earthly body, he is using his life to refer to the actions that he does while living in his body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the actions that I now do while living in my body, I do by faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:20	rtmc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὃ & νῦν ζῶ ἐν σαρκί	1	Here, Paul uses the word **flesh**, which is one part of his body, to refer to his entire body. The phrase **that which I now live in the flesh** means that life which I now live in the body and refers to Paul’s present life on earth in his physical body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “that life which I now live in the body” or “that life which I now live in my body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:20	a4j0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν πίστει ζῶ τῇ τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the word **by** is expressing means and is introducing the means by which Paul now lives, specifically **by faith** in **the Son of God**. So when Paul says **I live by faith that is in the Son of God** he means that he now lives his life by means of having faith in God’s Son. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. See how you translated the similar phrase “through faith in Jesus Christ” in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “I live by having faith in God’s Son” or “I live by exercising faith in God’s Son” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:20	bkxd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form such as "trusting," or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:20	kj4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	τῇ	1	Here, Paul uses the word **that** to introduce the specific object of his **faith**, which is **the Son of God** and not the law of Moses. Use a natural form to express this use of the word **that**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:20	m55w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ ἀγαπήσαντός με	1	The phrase **the one** refers to **the Son of God**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “who is the one having loved me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:20	by5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παραδόντος ἑαυτὸν	1	The phrase **having given himself** means that Jesus voluntarily made himself available as a sacrifice. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “having voluntarily given himself as a sacrifice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:21	tj6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐκ ἀθετῶ	1	Here, Paul expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative phrase, **do not**, together with a phrase, **set aside** that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I strongly affirm” or “I do uphold” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
2:21	xvoq			οὐκ ἀθετῶ	1	Alternate translation: “I do not ignore” or “I do not dismiss”
2:21	g5b8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea with an adverb or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. See how you translated the similar expression “the grace of Christ” in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “what God graciously did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:21	ogus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνη	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “righteous,” or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:21	yl3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ γὰρ διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη, ἄρα Χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is not true. Paul stated two times in [2:16](../02/16.md) that no person is made righteous before God by obeying the law of Moses. Also, Paul knows that Christ died for a definite purpose. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certainly false, and if your readers might misunderstand this and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could translate his words as a negative statement. If your language does state things as a hypothetical possibility that the speaker is trying to prove false, then use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “since we know that righteousness is through faith in Christ and not through the law of Moses, or else Christ would have died for nothing” or “for we know that God considers us righteous because we believe in Christ and not because we keep the law of Moses, or else Christ would have died for nothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
2:21	imxg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ γὰρ διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη, ἄρα Χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν	1	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to teach the Galatian believers. Use a natural way in your language for expressing conditional “if … then” constructions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
2:21	m74u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ & διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη	1	Here, the word **through** expresses the means by which something happens. The phrase **if righteousness is through the law** means “if righteousness could be obtained through keeping the law.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “if righteousness could be obtained by keeping the law” or “if a person could be justified by keeping the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:21	dv5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	διὰ νόμου	1	The phrase **through the law** is equivalent in meaning to the phrase "by works of the law" in [2:16](../02/16.md). See how you translated the phrase “by works of the law” in [2:16](../02/16.md) where it occurs twice. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

3:intro	xd92				0	# Galatians 3 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Equality in Christ\n\nAll Christians are equally united to Christ. Ancestry, gender, and status do not matter. All are equal with each other. All are equal in the eyes of God.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nPaul uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter. He uses them to convince the Galatians of their wrong thinking. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Those of faith are children of Abraham”\nBible scholars are divided on what this means. Some believe Christians inherit the promises that God gave to Abraham, so Christians replace the physical descendants of Israel. Others believe Christians spiritually follow Abraham, but they do not inherit all of the promises that God gave to Abraham. In light of Paul’s other teachings and the context here, Paul is probably writing about the Jewish and Gentile Christians sharing the same faith as Abraham did. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n\n### “the law”\n\nThe phrase “the law” is a singular noun that refers to a group of laws that God gave Israel by dictating them to Moses. This phrase occurs in chapters 2-5, and quite frequently in chapters two and three. Every time this phrase occurs in Galatians it refers to the group of laws that God dictated to Moses at Mount Sinai. You should translate this phrase the same way each time it occurs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
3:1	u6lo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ὦ	1	**O** is an exclamation word. Use an exclamation that would be natural to use in this context. Alternate translation: “Oh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
3:1	xvji			ἀνόητοι Γαλάται	1	Alternate translation: “you Galatians are without understanding” or “you Galatians who are without understanding”
3:1	p7uw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ὑμᾶς ἐβάσκανεν	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to rebuke the Galatian believers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:1	ryu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τίς ὑμᾶς ἐβάσκανεν	1	Paul is using irony to express the fact that the Galatian believers are acting as though someone has put a spell on them. He does not really believe that someone has put a spell on them. In fact, Paul is upset with the Galatians believers for willingly choosing to believe false teachers and letting themselves be deceived. If it would be helpful in your language, consider expressing the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How can you behave as if someone has put a spell on you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
3:1	gwv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἷς κατ’ ὀφθαλμοὺς Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς προεγράφη ἐσταυρωμένος	1	The phrase **publicly portrayed** is a metaphor in which Paul is either referring to the practice at that time of someone publicly drawing a picture for people to see or the practice of someone posting a public announcement for people to read. If the first option is what Paul intends then he is referring to his preaching the good news about Jesus as if it were a clear picture that the Galatians had seen with their eyes and if he intends the second option then is referring to his preaching the good news about Jesus as if it were a public announcement which he had posted and which the Galatians had read. Both options have the same general meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you yourselves heard the clear teaching about Jesus being crucified” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:1	ty3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	προεγράφη ἐσταυρωμένος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:2	wq9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐξ ἔργων νόμου τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐλάβετε, ἢ ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to rebuke the Galatian believers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You received the Spirit not by doing what the law says, but by believing what you heard.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:2	dbp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐξ ἔργων νόμου	1	See how you translated the phrase **by works of the law** in [2:16](../02/16.md), where it occurs three times. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:2	j39h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	νόμου	1	See how you translated the phrase **the law** in [2:16](../02/016.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
3:2	cfj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως	1	Paul is using the possessive form here to describe the response that the Galatians had when they heard the preaching of the gospel. The Galatians had respond to the preaching of the gospel with **faith**. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify the relationship for your readers. Alternate translation: “by believing what you heard” or “by hearing with faith” or “by trusting in the Messiah when you heard the message about him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:2	ds9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πίστεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “believing” or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: "and believing" (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:3	f96u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὕτως ἀνόητοί ἐστε	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to emphatically express his surprise. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are very foolish!” or “Don’t be so foolish!” or “Surely you cannot be so foolish!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:3	vof3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐναρξάμενοι Πνεύματι, νῦν σαρκὶ ἐπιτελεῖσθε	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to guide the Galatian believers thinking about what they are doing. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:3	croz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐναρξάμενοι	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “Having begun the Christian life” or “Having begun your new relationship with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:3	xu4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σαρκὶ	1	Paul is describing the actions people do while in their body by association with their body, which he calls **flesh**. Here, **flesh** refers to a reliance on one’s own effort in doing outward deeds and doing these actions with a self-sufficient and self-reliant trust in them instead of trusting in God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “by your own effort” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:4	iyj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τοσαῦτα ἐπάθετε εἰκῇ	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form in order to try to make the Galatian believers think about the implications of believing and following the false teachers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:4	xujz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τοσαῦτα ἐπάθετε εἰκῇ— εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ	1	The original word that Paul used, which is translated as **experienced** by the ULT, could refer to: (1) experiencing bad things such as suffering. If this is what Paul means here, then he is referring to the suffering that the Galatians believers experienced when they were persecuted. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that if what God has done for you was because of your obeying the laws that God gave to Moses and not because of trusting in Christ, did you not suffer so many things needlessly? I certainly hope that you did not suffer like that needlessly” (2) the spiritual privileges and blessings that the Galatian believers had experienced such as receiving God’s Spirit and God “working miracles” among them, both of which are mentioned in the next verse. If your language does not allow you to use a neutral term but rather requires a more specific term, you could specify that the things the Galatians experienced were good things. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that if the good things God has done for you were because you obeyed the laws that God gave to Moses and not because you trusted in Christ, then the good things God has done for you have been wasted. I certainly hope that the good things you have experienced have not been wasted” (3) both good things and bad things and be referring to both the persecution that the Galatians had experienced and the spiritual blessings that they had experienced. Because it is not known for sure the type of things to which Paul is referring, if possible you should try to use a neutral term or expression. You could then translate this rhetorical question as the ULT does or with a similar neutral phrase such as “Did all the things that happened to you not cause you to think about them?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
3:4	mvad			ἐπάθετε	1	Alternate translation: “Did you experience”
3:4	nq68			εἰκῇ— εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ	1	Alternate translation: “uselessly—if indeed it was really useless” or “in vain—if indeed it was really in vain” or “for no purpose—if indeed it was really for no purpose”
3:4	xl9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ	1	The phrase **if indeed it was really for nothing** shows contingency regarding his rhetorical question, **Have you experienced so many things for nothing**, and shows that Paul retains hope for the Galatians. Paul hopes they will not make the **many things** that they have **experienced** be **for nothing** by obeying the false teaching that they must obey the laws of Moses such as the dietary laws and laws about circumcision. Paul is making a hypothetical statement to help his readers recognize the serious implications of following the teachings of these false teachers. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “if indeed it was really for nothing that you experienced so many things, but I hope with you that this is not the case” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
3:4	mx8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ	1	The phrase **if indeed it was really for nothing** is a rhetorical question. Paul is using the question form here to help the Galatians think about what he is saying and demonstrate his continued hope that they will decide against the teachings of the false teachers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:5	fuzy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὁ οὖν ἐπιχορηγῶν ὑμῖν τὸ Πνεῦμα καὶ ἐνεργῶν δυνάμεις ἐν ὑμῖν, ἐξ ἔργων νόμου ἢ ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως	1	This entire verse is a rhetorical question. Paul is using the question form here to teach the Galatians a truth by engaging their reasoning. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “God who gives you his Spirit and does miracles among you does not do these things because you obey the law of Moses. Surely you must know that God gives you these blessings because you believed the good news about the Messiah when you heard it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:5	upx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ	1	Here, the phrase **the one** refers to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God, who is the one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:5	y4ka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	νόμου	1	See how you translated the phrase **the law** in [2:16](../02/016.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

3:5	s3bc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐξ ἔργων νόμου ἢ ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως	1	Paul asks another rhetorical question to remind the Galatians of how they received the Spirit. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:5	j4vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐξ ἔργων νόμου	1	See how you translated the phrase **by works of the law** in [2:16](../02/16.md) where it occurs three times. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:5	e17q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως	1	Your language may require that what the people heard and whom they trusted be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: “because you heard the message and had faith in Jesus” or “because you listened to the message and trusted in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:6	ahy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καθὼς	1	Here, the phrase **Just as** indicates that what follows is connected to what preceded it, specifically [3:1-5](../03/01.md). The phrase **Just as** is also introducing new information. The new information that this phrase is introducing is the biblical example of Abraham. Use a form that would be appropriate in this context. Alternate translation: “Even as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:6	iv9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ἐπίστευσεν τῷ Θεῷ καὶ ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην	1	Here, Paul quotes Genesis 15:16. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with opening and closing quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning and end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:6	ohbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐλογίσθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God credited it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:6	ghuy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλογίσθη	1	Here, the word **it** refers to Abraham’s belief in God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God credited his belief” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:6	f7sv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνην	1	See how you translated the word **righteousness** in [2:21](../02/21.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	i9x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἱ ἐκ πίστεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “trust,” or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “those who believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	rh9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ ἐκ πίστεως	1	Your language may require you to state the object of **faith**. Here, the phrase **by faith** is probably a shortened way of saying “who by faith in Christ are trusting God to consider them righteous” or “who are trusting God to consider them righteous because they believe in Christ.” Here, the phrase **by faith** is equivalent or similar in meaning to the phrase “by faith in Christ” in [2:16](../02/16.md), where it occurs in the phrase “we also believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning explicitly here. Alternate translation: “the ones who by faith in Christ are trusting God to consider them righteous” or “the ones who are trusting God to consider them righteous because they believe in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	kq1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοί & Ἀβραὰμ	1	People who have faith in God, as Abraham did, are here spoken of as if they were Abraham’s **sons**. Paul does not mean that people who have faith in God are Abraham’s biological descendants but, rather, he is saying that they share a spiritual similarity to him because they believe in God. Therefore Paul calls them **sons of Abraham**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:7	pq0z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	υἱοί	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:8	vs1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	προϊδοῦσα & ἡ Γραφὴ, ὅτι ἐκ πίστεως δικαιοῖ τὰ ἔθνη ὁ Θεὸς, προευηγγελίσατο τῷ Ἀβραὰμ	1	Here, **the Scripture** is spoken of as though it were a person who could foresee **that God would justify the Gentiles by faith** and **preach the gospel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:8	htbq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ πίστεως	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the object of **faith** explicitly. Alternate translation: “by their faith in God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:8	ojbm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ πίστεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “believing.” Alternate translation: “by believing in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:8	f6ly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	προευηγγελίσατο τῷ Ἀβραὰμ	1	The sentence **In you all the nations will be blessed** is a quotation from Genesis 12:3. Use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham where it is written” or “preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham when Moses wrote” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
3:8	j83j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πάντα τὰ ἔθνη	1	Here, the term **nations** refers to the people who make up these **nations**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “people from all the nations” or “people from every nation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:8	qf98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνευλογηθήσονται ἐν σοὶ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “In you God will bless all the nations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:9	ss1b			ὥστε	1	Alternate translation: “Therefore” or “Consequently”

3:9	m5ef		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ ἐκ πίστεως εὐλογοῦνται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God will bless the ones by faith” or “God will bless the ones who believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:10	mxe7			ὅσοι γὰρ ἐξ ἔργων νόμου εἰσὶν	1	Alternate translation: “All people who follow the law” or “All those who seek to be justified through obeying the law”
3:10	r5bm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅσοι & ἐξ ἔργων νόμου εἰσὶν	1	Here, the phrase **as many as are of works of the law** is probably a shortened way of saying “as many as are relying on works of the law as the basis for God considering them to be righteous.”  Here, the phrase **as many as are of works of the law** is describing people who rely on the **works of the law** and is in contrast to the phrase “the ones by faith” in [3:7](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “as many as rely on the works of the law as the basis for being righteous before God” or “as many as are relying on works of the law as the basis for God considering them to be righteous” or “as many as are trusting that God will consider them righteous because they try to obey the law of Moses” or “as many as are seeking for God to consider them righteous on the basis of following what the Mosaic Law commands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:10	uz3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐξ ἔργων νόμου	1	With the phrase **of works**, Paul is using the possessive form to describe the means by which a person seeks to please God, and by using the phrase **of the law**, Paul is using the possessive form to define the type of **works** to which he is referring to.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “until the seed, who is Christ, would come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:19	bgi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου	1	The phrase **by the hand of** is an idiom which means “through.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “through a mediator” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:19	edcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μεσίτου	1	Moses is the **mediator**to whom Paul is referring. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “of Moses, who acted as a mediator” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:19	nl4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπήγγελται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God had made the promise” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:20	x9l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὁ δὲ μεσίτης ἑνὸς οὐκ ἔστιν	1	In this verse Paul is proving to the Galatian believers that God’s promise to Abraham is superior to the law that he gave Moses. What Paul means by saying **a mediator is not for one** is that a mediator is not needed when one person is speaking with another person directly. Paul is implicitly expressing to the Galatian believers that the promise to Abraham is superior to the law because it was not given through a mediator but, rather, God gave the promise directly to Abraham. If it would help your readers and if you are using footnotes, you could indicate that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])\n\n\n\n
3:20	y3ix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑνὸς	1	The phrase **for one** leaves the object implied. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what **one** is referring to. Alternate translation: “for one party alone” or “needed when there is only one party involved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:20	lhui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	2	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to the opening statement in this verse that **a mediator is not for one**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:20	l2b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δὲ	2	Here, the word **but** is introducing the phrase **God is one**, which is an allusion to a phrase in Deuteronomy 6:4. The Galatians believers would have known that Paul was referencing this scripture. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly that the word **but** is introducing a reference from Scripture. Alternate translation: “but as Moses wrote in Scripture,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:20	cle8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν	1	Here Paul uses a well-known phrase about God to demonstrate that God's promises directly to Abraham were superior to the law that he gave through Moses. You can include some of this information in the text or a footnote if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Abraham received the promises from God alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:21	zwk0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὁ & νόμος κατὰ τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to anticipate a question that the Galatian believers might have. He introduces his answer to the question which begins with the phrase **For if a law was given being able to make alive**. If it would help your readers, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “you might think that the law is against the promises” or “you might think that the law is opposed to the promises” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:21	e43u			κατὰ τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν	1	Alternate translation: “opposed to the promises” or “in conflict with the promises”
3:21	ee7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν	1	The phrase **the promises** refers to the promises that God made to Abraham. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the promises that God made to Abraham” or “God’s promises to Abraham” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:21	nd97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	μὴ γένοιτο	1	**May it never be** is an emphatic way of negating a statement. The statement that the phrase **May it never be** is negating is the proposed question **is the law against the promises**. Use a natural word or expression for strongly negating an idea. Alternate translation: “Certainly not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
3:21	jnwe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ & ἐδόθη νόμος ὁ δυνάμενος ζῳοποιῆσαι, ὄντως	1	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to teach the Galatian believers.

3:21	bjpb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδόθη νόμος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that God did it. Alternate translation: “God gave a law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:21	dljp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζῳοποιῆσαι	1	Here, it is implied that Paul is referring to making people alive. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to make people alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:21	skc0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ζῳοποιῆσαι	1	The phrase **to make alive** could refer to: (1) both eternal life in the future and to making people spiritually alive in the present. Paul is probably referring to both here since in this letter Paul discusses the important role of the Holy Spirit and the fact that the Holy Spirit is given through faith and not the law. (2) eternal life in the future after a person dies. If it is possible in your language, it would be best to retain a general phrase, as modeled by the ULT, since Paul does not explain the phrase **to make alive**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
3:21	iyg9			ἐν νόμου ἂν ἦν ἡ δικαιοσύνη	1	Alternate translation: “we could have become righteous by obeying that law”
3:22	smkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here Paul uses the word **But** to indicate a strong contrast between the hypothetical and false possibility that the law could make a person righteous and to introduce his explanation of what the law actually does. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “But rather,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:22	yzcp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνέκλεισεν ἡ Γραφὴ τὰ πάντα ὑπὸ ἁμαρτίαν	1	Paul speaks of **the Scripture** as if it were an authority figure who **imprisoned** people. He speaks of **sin** as if it were a jail from which people cannot break free. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:22	jbn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ Γραφὴ	1	Here, the word **Scripture** could: (1) refer to all Old Testament Scripture. The ULT indicates when the word **Scripture** refers to the entire Bible or the entire Old Testament by capitalizing the word **Scripture**. (2) refer to a particular passage of scripture such as Deuteronomy 27:26 or some other specific Old Testament passage. Alternate translation: “the scripture”
3:22	dxqc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ Γραφὴ	1	Paul is describing God doing something by association with his Word, **the Scripture**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:22	mk9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ πάντα	1	Here, the phrase **all things* could refer to: (1) all people. If your language requires you to indicate explicitly what **all things** refers to, you could indicate that it refers to people. Alternate translation: “all humans” (2) the entire creation and the things which make up this present fallen world. See Romans 8:18-22. If you decide that this is what Paul means, you should use a general phrase such as **all things**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

3:22	xqmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Following the phrase **so that**, Paul states the purpose for which **the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
3:22	pvv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ ἐπαγγελία ἐκ πίστεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ δοθῇ τοῖς πιστεύουσιν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “God might give the promise by faith in Jesus Christ to the ones believing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

3:22	bo1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πίστεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “trust,” or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:23	jzut		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν & τὴν μέλλουσαν πίστιν ἀποκαλυφθῆναι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “trust” or “believe,” or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language.

3:23	uu10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐφρουρούμεθα	1	When Paul says **we**, he is including the Galatian believers, so **we** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:23	su16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑπὸ νόμον ἐφρουρούμεθα, συνκλειόμενοι	1	Here, Paul is continuing the metaphor of **the law** that he began in the previous verse. The power that **the law** had over humans is spoken of as if the law were a prison guard holding people captive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:23	aue6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὸ	1	Here, the word **under** means “under the authority of” or “under the jurisdiction of.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

3:23	r5y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὑπὸ νόμον ἐφρουρούμεθα, συνκλειόμενοι	1	Here, Paul is continuing his personification of **the law** that he began in the previous verse. Paul speaks of **the law** as though it were a jailer who **held** people **captive** and kept them **imprisoned until** the time when the coming **faith** in Jesus Christ would **be revealed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

Alternate translation: “until God would reveal the message about trusting in Christ that he was about to reveal” (2) be translated as “to” and be indicating the purpose for people being **imprisoned** under the law, namely so that people would be ready for the coming faith in Jesus Christ. Alternate translation: “in order to lead us to believe in the good news that God was about to reveal” or “in order that we might be ready to believe the good news concerning Christ, the news that God would later reveal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

3:24	mcdn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ νόμος, παιδαγωγὸς ἡμῶν γέγονεν	1	Paul speaks of **the law** as if it were a **guardian**.

3:28	srk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐκ ἔνι Ἰουδαῖος οὐδὲ Ἕλλην, οὐκ ἔνι δοῦλος οὐδὲ ἐλεύθερος, οὐκ ἔνι ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ, πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς εἷς ἐστε ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces the reason for why, if someone is a believer in Christ, it is as if there is no longer **Jew nor Greek** or **slave** or **free** or **male** or **female**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase, which follows the word **for**, gives the reason for the result that the first part of this verse describes. Alternate translation: “Because you are all one in Christ Jesus, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:28	tu05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔνι Ἰουδαῖος οὐδὲ Ἕλλην, οὐκ ἔνι δοῦλος οὐδὲ ἐλεύθερος, οὐκ ἔνι ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ, πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς εἷς ἐστε ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul says that people who believe in Christ are no longer divided by racial, social, or gender distinctions but, rather, now have **one** common identity **in Christ**. Human distinctions now cease to be significant because believers are united in a new spiritual identity, which is being **in Christ**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “For you who are united by your faith in Christ Jesus, it is now as if there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female” or “For you who are united by belief in Christ Jesus, it is now as if there is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:28	zxfp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἕλλην	1	Here, the term **Greek** refers to non-Jewish people.

3:28	pfrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλεύθερος	1	Here, the term **free** refers to people who are not slaves and thus are free from bondage to a master. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “free person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:28	fy09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces a reason. Use a natural form for introducing the reason for something that was said previously. Alternate translation: “because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:28	fakq			πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς εἷς ἐστε ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “because all of you are together joined to Messiah Jesus”
3:28	mppd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἷς	1	Here, Paul uses the word **one** to indicate that all believers share an equal position because of the new identity they have by being **in Christ**. (Paul explains his statement from the previous verse that all believers have put on Christ, meaning that they have a new and common identity derived from and centered on Christ). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what **one** means here. Alternate translation: “alike” or “of equal standing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:28	pddu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul speaks of believers being **in Christ Jesus** as if **Christ Jesus** were a physical location in which someone could be. Here, **in Christ** refers to being spiritually united with Christ in close spiritual union with him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of this phrase plainly. Alternative translation: “in close spiritual union with Christ” or “because of your close spiritual union with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

3:29	ovzy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ & ἄρα	1	Paul is using an **if … then** statement to express a hypothetical condition and what the result is for those people who meet the requirement of the condition. Paul is telling the Galatians that **if** they belong to Christ, **then** they are Abraham's spiritual descendants. Use a natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical condition. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
3:29	lth0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμεῖς & ἐστέ	1	Here, both occurrences of the word **you** are plural and refer to the Galatian believers. Your language may require you to mark these forms as plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
3:29	wceh			ὑμεῖς Χριστοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “you are Christ’s” or “you belong to Christ”
3:29	xwrj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σπέρμα	1	Here, the term **seed** means offspring. It is a word picture. Just as plants produce seeds that can grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. See how you translated the word **seed** in [3:16](../03/16.md) where it is used with a similar meaning. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly.

3:29	qp4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κληρονόμοι	1	Paul speaks of believers, who are the spiritual descendants **of Abraham**, as if they were **heirs** who were to inherit property and wealth from a family member.

4:intro	h6gw				0	# Galatians 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 27, which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sonship\n\nSonship is a complex issue. Scholars have many views on Israel’s sonship. Paul uses sonship to teach how being under the law differs from being free in Christ. Not all of Abraham’s physical descendants inherited God’s promises to him. Only his descendants through Isaac and Jacob inherited the promises. And God only adopts into his family those who follow Abraham spiritually through faith. They are children of God with an inheritance. Paul calls them children of promise. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Abba, Father\n\n“Abba” is an Aramaic word. In ancient Israel, people used it to informally refer to their fathers. Paul transliterates its sounds by writing them with Greek letters. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n\n### the law\n\nThe phrase “the law” is a singular noun that refers to a group of laws that God gave Israel by dictating them to Moses. This phrase occurs in chapters 2-5. Every time this phrase occurs in Galatians, it refers to the group of laws that God dictated to Moses at Mount Sinai. You should translate this phrase the same way each time it occurs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
4:1	vlu6			κύριος πάντων ὤν	1	Alternate translation: “though being master of all things” or “even though he is master of all things”
4:2	eyfx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **But** is introducing a contrast and indicating that what follows is in contrast to what came before it.

4:2	jtpo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐστὶ	1	Here, the word **he** refers to the heir mentioned in the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the heir is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

4:2	llwi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιτρόπους & καὶ οἰκονόμους	1	The terms **guardians** and **stewards** refer to two different roles, but these terms do not necessarily refer to two different groups of people since one person could have responsibility for filling both roles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “someone who is his guardian and steward” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	bd5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπιτρόπους	1	A guardian was a person who had the role of being responsible for a child. This person’s job was to supervise and care for the child of whom they were in charge to make sure that the child was instructed in what they should do. Use a natural phrase or term in your language for describing this role. If you do not have this role in your culture you could describe it for your readers. Alternate translation: “people who are in charge of a child” or “people who are responsible for a minor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:2	v5g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οἰκονόμους	1	Here, the word **stewards** refers to people who are entrusted with the role of managing property until the heir is old enough to inherit it. Use a natural phrase or term in your language for describing this role. If you do not have this role in your culture, you could describe it for your readers.

4:2	khzl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	προθεσμίας τοῦ πατρός	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “date which his father appointed” or “time which his father appointed”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:3	ocm2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὕτως	1	Here, the word **So** indicates that what follows is comparable to, and similar in some way to what has just been described in [4:1-2](../04/01.md).

Alternate translation: “In a similar way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:3	d6v9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἦμεν	1	The word **we** here refers to all Christians, including Paul’s readers, so **we** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:3	n21q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅτε ἦμεν νήπιοι	1	Paul speaks of people who have not yet trusted in Jesus as if they were **children**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly, or you could translate this phrase as a simile. Alternate translation: “when we did not yet believe in Jesus” or “when we were like children spiritually” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	rwwj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑπὸ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου ἤμεθα δεδουλωμένοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who was doing the action, Paul says that the elemental principles of the world were doing it. See the note on personification regarding **the elemental principles of this world**. Alternate translation: “the elemental principles of the world were enslaving us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:3	cd2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δεδουλωμένοι	1	Paul speaks of being under the control of **the elemental principles of the world** as if it were slavery. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	l0fg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὸ	1	Here, the word **under** means “under the power of” or “under the authority of.” See how you translated the word **under** in [4:2](../04/02.md) where Paul uses it with a similar meaning.

4:3	v1zo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὑπὸ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου & δεδουλωμένοι	1	Here, Paul speaks of **the elemental principles of the world** as though they were a person who could enslave other people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning plainly. Paul speaks of **the elemental principles of the world** as though they have the power to enslave a person, but it is actually humans who do not yet believe in the Messiah, who willing submit to these **elemental principles** and allow themselves to be enslaved. See [5:1](../05/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
4:3	u462		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου	1	Here, **the elemental principles of the world** could refer to: (1) the religious and/or moral teachings that people, whether they be a Jew or non-Jew, seek to obey in order to please God and think of themselves as praiseworthy and good. Alternate translation: “the elemental rules of this world” or “the rudimentary principles of this world” (2) the things prescribed by the Mosaic law. Alternate translation: “the things prescribed by the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:4	ogo3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	The word **But** is introducing a contrast between the time prior to **when the fullness of time came**, which Paul described before this verse, and the time after **the fullness of time came**, which Paul describes in this verse. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: "Instead," (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:4	ujfp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου	1	The phrase **the fullness of time** means “the right time” or “the time that God appointed.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

4:4	opx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γενόμενον ἐκ γυναικός	1	The phrase **born from a woman** is an idiom which means that someone is human. Because Jesus existed as God before he was born on earth, the emphasis here is that Jesus became human, in addition to being fully God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “having taken on human nature” or “having been born as a human being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:4	d9c7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γενόμενον ὑπὸ νόμον	1	The phrase **having been born under the law** means that Jesus, as a Jew, was under the jurisdiction of the law of Moses and therefore it was necessary that he obey it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “having been born under the jurisdiction and requirements of the law of Moses” or “having been born subject to the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:4	mzwh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὸ νόμον	1	Here, the word **under** means “under the authority of” or “under the jurisdiction of.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

Alternate translation: “under the authority of the law” or “under the jurisdiction of the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	cb45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **in order that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which God sent forth his Son. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “so that” or “with the purpose that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:5	v5cb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξαγοράσῃ	1	With the word **redeem**, Paul uses the metaphor of a person buying back lost property or buying the freedom of a slave as a picture of God sending Jesus to pay the price for people’s sins by dying on the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:5	nppu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	2	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause.

Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” or “with the purpose that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:5	jhhy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὸ	1	See how you translated the word **under** in [3:23](../03/23.md) where it is used with the same meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	eapv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὴν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπολάβωμεν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:5	ii90		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀπολάβωμεν	1	The word **we** could refer to: (1) all Christians, both Jews and non-Jews, in which case **we** would be inclusive.

4:5	tpqc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπολάβωμεν	1	Paul speaks of God giving people a close personal relationship with himself and giving them special rights and privileges as if it were **adoption**.

Alternate translation: “the spiritual children of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:5	lq4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	υἱοθεσίαν	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “adoption as children” or “adoption as God’s children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:6	ahbp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, Paul is using the word **And** to introduce new information into his ongoing argument.

He means that these people have a father-son relationship with God because they trust in Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. See how you translated the word **sons** in [4:5](../04/05.md), where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “the spiritual children of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:6	nei3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν	1	Here, the word **hearts** refers to the innermost part of a person. Paul is describing the innermost part of a person by association with their physical heart. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent term from your culture that is used to describe the center of a person’s inner being or you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “to live within each of us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:6	s54r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κρᾶζον	1	The phrase **crying out** means calling out loudly. This phrase does not mean to cry or weep from sorrow.

4:6	eqx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἀββά, ὁ Πατήρ	1	The word **Abba** is an Aramaic word meaning **Father** and which the Jews used to address their fathers. Paul writes it as it sounds in Aramaic (he transliterates it) and then translates its meaning into Greek for his readers. Since the Aramaic word **Abba** is followed by the Greek word **Father**, it is best to transliterate **Abba** and then give its meaning in your language, as Paul does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
4:7	jkor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	The phrase **So then** introduces the result of what Paul explained in [4:6](../04/06.md).

4:7	akb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	εἶ	1	Here,**you** is singular. Paul is probably addressing the Galatian believers by using a singular pronoun in order to emphasize that what he is saying applies to each of them individually. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
4:7	iler		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δοῦλος	1	Paul speaks of the Galatian believers being in bondage to the law of Moses as if they were in slavery.

4:7	rlc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ δὲ υἱός, καὶ	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since each of you is a son, you are also” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
4:7	eujw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κληρονόμος	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly that Paul is referring to inheriting the promises that God made to Abraham and his descendants. Alternate translation: “an heir of the promises made to Abraham” or “an heir of the promises God made to Abraham”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:7	po66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	διὰ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the word **through** is indicating agency. It is indicating that God is the agent by which the Galatians are to inherit the blessings promised to Abraham and his descendants. Use a natural form for indicating the agency or means by which an action takes place. Alternate translation: “by means of God’s working” or “through God’s working” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:8	v4mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	The word **But** is introducing a contrast. Paul is contrasting the life of the Galatian believers before they believed in Christ with their life after they believed in Christ and as a result became God’s sons (which he explained in [4:1-7](../04/01.md)). Use a natural form in your language for introducing a contrast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:8	e21a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰδότες Θεὸν	1	Here, the phrase **having known God** means knowing God in a close personal relationship. It means more than simply having heard about God or knowing some things about God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “having been in a close relationship with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

4:8	cj5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς φύσει μὴ οὖσι θεοῖς	1	The phrase, **the ones by nature not being gods** refers to the beings which the Galatians served when they were pagans and which were considered by them to be gods though they were not really gods.

4:9	kv61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γνόντες & γνωσθέντες	1	Make sure that you translate the words **know** and **known** with the same type of expression as you used to translate the word “known” in [4:8](../04/08.md). The phrase “not having known God” in [4:8](../04/08.md) and the phrases **know God** and **known by God** in this verse are all referring to having intimate personal knowledge that comes from a close relationship.

4:10	w7d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡμέρας & καὶ μῆνας, καὶ καιροὺς, καὶ ἐνιαυτούς	1	Paul is describing the different Jewish celebrations and religious observances required in the law of Moses by associating them with the times when they took place.

4:12	gteu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γίνεσθε ὡς ἐγώ, ὅτι κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς	1	Paul is asking the Galatian believers to become like himself and not act as if the law of Moses has authority over their lives. He says that formerly, when they did not obey the law of Moses, he had become like them and not obeyed all the rules prescribed it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “act like I act by not living your life as if you need to obey the law of Moses, because when I was with you did not obey all the rules and ceremonial laws prescribed in the law of Moses” or “become as I am by not acting as if you have to obey the law of Moses, because formerly I became as you were before you were deceived into thinking that you needed to obey the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:12	b4w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γίνεσθε ὡς ἐγώ, ὅτι κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because I became as you, you also should become as I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:12	cg8i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Here, the implied words are **became** and **are**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:12	n3wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐδέν με ἠδικήσατε	1	Here Paul expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

This could mean that: (1) Paul was already in Galatia when illness caused him to remain there to recover, which gave him time and opportunity to proclaim the gospel to the Galatians. (2) because of a physical illness, Paul went to Galatia to recover from his sickness. While there, he proclaimed the gospel to the Galatians. Because Paul does not explicitly state what provided the opportunity for him to preach the gospel, you should not further explain what Paul says here about his sickness but, rather, you should use a general expression. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:13	ho2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	δι’	1	Here, Paul is using the phrase **because** to introduce the reason that he **proclaimed the gospel** to the Galatians **previously**, which was **because** he had to stay in Galatia due to illness. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a reason-result clause. Here, the reason is **a weakness of the flesh** and the result is that Paul **proclaimed the gospel to** the Galatians. Alternate translation: “on account of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:13	qstf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀσθένειαν τῆς σαρκὸς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **weakness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “weak,” or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language.

4:13	iuz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τῆς σαρκὸς	1	Here, Paul uses the word **flesh**, which is one part of his body, to refer to his entire body.

4:14	tk1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τὸν πειρασμὸν ὑμῶν ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου	1	The phrase **your trial in my flesh** means that Paul had some physical problem or malady that either itself caused difficulty (a **trial**) for the Galatians or caused difficulty (a **trial**) for them because they had to care for or help him as a result of his physical problem. Because Paul does not reveal specifically how his physical malady created a **trial** for the Galatians, it is best to translate this phrase with a general phrase which leaves room for either possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:14	v9xa			οὐκ ἐξουθενήσατε	1	Alternate translation: “you did not scorn” or “you did not hate”

See how you translated the phrase **the flesh** in [2:20](../02/20.md) where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:14	l244		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς ἄγγελον Θεοῦ	1	The phrase **as an angel of God** means ”as if I were an angel of God.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

4:15	kcer		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μακαρισμὸς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **blessing**, you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:15	paah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces information which proves how the Galatians had previously felt about Paul.

4:15	wyyt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰ δυνατὸν τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ὑμῶν ἐξορύξαντες, ἐδώκατέ μοι	1	The phrase **having torn out your eyes, you would have given them to me** could: (1) be an idiom indicating the great love and devotion which the Galatians formerly had for Paul. In Paul’s time the eyes were considered a person’s most precious possession, so if it were possible for a person to take out their eyes and give them to another person, this would indicate great love. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “you formerly loved me very much and would have given me your most valued possession to show me your love” (2) indicate that Paul had some type of eye disease. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:16	i73s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Paul is using the phrase **So then** to introduce a reason-result clause in which **speaking truth** to the Galatians is the reason, and them acting as if Paul was their **enemy** is the result. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a reason-result clause. Alternate translation: “Therefore” or “Therefore, as a result of” or “So then, as a result of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:16	zznv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐχθρὸς ὑμῶν γέγονα, ἀληθεύων ὑμῖν	1	The phrase **speaking truth to you, have I become your enemy** is a rhetorical question in which Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to show the Galatian believers his disappointment with them and cause them to think about what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “as a result of my speaking the truth to you, you are acting as if I have become your enemy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

4:17	dxtd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζηλοῦσιν & θέλουσιν	1	In this verse, the pronouns **They** and **they** both refer to the false teachers who were Judaizers and were teaching the Galatians false things.

4:17	lt7y			οὐ καλῶς	1	Alternate translation: “not in a good way” or “not in a way that is right”
4:17	rulh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **but** is introducing a contrast. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but instead,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:17	s9kn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκκλεῖσαι ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the the phrase **to separate you** refers to separating the Galatian believers from Paul and probably also from his ministry partners, because they all taught a gospel message that was different from what the false teachers were teaching the Galatian believers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly from whom Paul is saying that the false teachers are trying to separate the Galatian believers. Alternate translation: “to separate you from us” or “to make you stop being loyal to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:17	wrvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause.

4:19	u3eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνα μου	1	Paul speaks of the Galatian believers as if they were his **children** and he was their parent. The Galatian believers experienced their spiritual birth as a result of Paul’s work of proclaiming the gospel to them, so he was their spiritual parent and they were his spiritual **children**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “You who believed the message about Jesus that I proclaimed to you” or “My spiritual children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:19	yf9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάλιν ὠδίνω	1	Paul speaks of his work of seeking to help the Galatians grow in spiritual maturity and the mental and physical suffering he endured as a result of this work as if it were the **labor** that a mother endures when giving birth to a child.

Alternate translation: “Christ’s nature becomes fully developed in you” or “you become a mature follower of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:19	k4fo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μορφωθῇ Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “because I am perplexed about you, I am desiring to be present with you now and to change my tone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:20	j8on		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλάξαι τὴν φωνήν μου	1	The phrase **change my tone** refers to Paul changing the manner of his communication towards the Galatians from sternly  rebuking to being more affectionate. Paul loved the Galatian believers. However, because of the serious nature of the false teaching which the Galatians were being tempted to accept, combined with Paul’s physical distance from the Galatians, he felt that he needed to write to them and firmly and sternly correct their false thinking with the hope that they would not believe or follow false teaching. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what the phrase **change my tone** means here.

4:22	fkbv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γέγραπται	1	Here, Paul uses **it is written** to mean that it is written in the Old Testament Scriptures.

4:22	gthm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:22	wbg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἕνα ἐκ τῆς παιδίσκης, καὶ ἕνα ἐκ τῆς ἐλευθέρας	1	In both instances in the phrases **one by the slave girl and one by the free woman**, Paul is using the adjective "one" as a noun in order to indicate a specific kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the word “son” to show Paul's meaning.

He compares the empty city to a **desolate** woman, a woman whose husband has left her, and he speaks of the inhabitants of Jerusalem as if they were **children**. In this passage from Isaiah 54:1, Isaiah is picturing Israel as a wife who is abandoned by her husband, which is God. Having **children** in this context refers to having inhabitants. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning plainly.

In this chapter Paul declares repeatedly that Christ has freed believers from being obligated to obey the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Fruit of the Spirit\n\nThe phrase “the fruit of the Spirit” is not plural, even though it begins a list of several things. The word “fruit” is singular and refers to the nine qualities listed in [5:22–23](../05/22.md) to show that they are a united cluster of qualities that are manifested in each believer. Translators should keep the singular form for “fruit” if possible. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])\n\n\n### the law\n\nThe phrase “the law” is a singular noun that refers to a group of laws that God gave Israel by dictating them to Moses. This phrase occurs in chapters 2-5. Every time this phrase occurs in Galatians it refers to the group of laws that God dictated to Moses at Mount Sinai.

6:intro	bv8h				0	# Galatians 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter concludes Paul’s letter. His final words address some additional issues that concerned him about the Galatian believers.\n\n### Brothers\n\nPaul writes the words in this chapter to Christians. He calls them brothers in [verses 1](../06/01.md) and [18[(../06/18.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### New Creation\n\nSomeone who becomes Christian is a new creation that is united with Christ ([6:15](../06/15.md); [2 Corinthians 5:17](../../2co/05/17.md)). Christians have been given a new way of living that will result in eternal life. This is more significant than a person’s ancestry or attempts to obey the laws God gave the Jews. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Flesh\n\nPaul uses the word “flesh” in a variety of ways throughout this letter. In this chapter he frequently uses flesh to refer to sinful human nature. He contrasts flesh with the Spirit in [verse 8](../06/08.md). However, he also uses flesh to refer to a person’s physical body or outward appearance in [verses 12–13](../06/12.md).
