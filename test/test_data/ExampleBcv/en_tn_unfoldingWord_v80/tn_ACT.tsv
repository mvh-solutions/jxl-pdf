front:intro	mw28				0	# Introduction to Acts\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Acts\n\n1. The apostles spread the good news about Jesus in Jerusalem (1:1–6:7)\n2. The church expands into Judea and Samaria (6:8–9:31)\n3. The church expands to include Gentiles (9:32–12:24)\n4. Paul goes to Asia Minor as an apostle to the Gentiles (12:25–16:5)\n5. The church expands into the middle Mediterranean area (16:6–19:20)\n6. Paul reaches Rome, but as a prisoner and after several trials (19:21–28:31)\n\nLuke makes transitional statements at 6:7, 9:31, 12:24, 16:5, and 19:20 to mark the movement from each major part of the book to the next part.\n\n### What is the book of Acts about?\n\nThe book of Acts tells the story of the early church. It relates how more and more people, from different backgrounds and in different parts of the Roman Empire, became believers in Jesus. It shows the power of the Holy Spirit helping the early Christians. The events in this book begin with the return of Jesus to heaven and they end about 30 years later.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Acts of the Apostles.” Or translators may choose a different title, for example, “The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles.”\n\n### Who wrote the book of Acts?\n\nThe author of this book does not give his own name. However, the book is dedicated to Theophilus, the same person to whom Luke dedicated his story of the life of Jesus, the Gospel of Luke. Also, in parts of this book, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person who traveled with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that Luke was the author of the book of Acts as well as the Gospel of Luke.\n\nLuke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. He personally witnessed many of the events that he describes in the book of Acts.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the church?\n\nThe church is the community of people who believe in Jesus as their Lord and Savior. The church includes both Jewish and Gentile believers. The book of Acts shows God helping the church. It shows God doing signs and wonders to confirm the church’s testimony to Jesus, leading many people to have faith in Jesus, guiding the church about where and how to share the good news, and enabling believers to resolve conflicts and endure persecution.\n\n### The kingdom of God\n\nThe “kingdom of God” is a major concept in the book of Acts, as it is in the Gospel of Luke. This concept is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of God ruling and of people embracing God’s rule over their lives. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating the idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom” with some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Figurative usages in the book of Acts\n\n“arise/arising”\n\nLuke often says “arise” or “arising” to mean taking action to get an enterprise under way, rather than to mean getting up from a sitting or lying position. Notes will indicate where this figurative usage occurs.\n\n“brothers”\n\nLuke often uses the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. Although this term is masculine, Luke uses the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you decide to retain this figurative usage in your translation, you could state “brothers and sisters” to indicate that the word has this generic sense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])### Possible translation difficulties in the book of Acts\n\n“to the same”\n\nThe phrase “to the same” occurs five times in this book (1:15, 2:1, 2:44, 2:47, 4:26). It is not entirely clear what this phrase means. In the first three instances it could mean “in the same place,” but it could also mean “in one accord,” that is, “in full agreement.” In 2:47 it seems to mean “to their group.” Paul uses the same phrase in 1 Corinthians 11:20 and 14:23, where it could mean “in the same place” or it could have the sense of full agreement and mean something like “in Christian fellowship.” That sense would fit Acts 2:47, where the phrase could be translated “to their Christian fellowship.” In 4:26 it could mean “to the same place,” but it could also mean “by agreement.” Notes will discuss the different possibilities in each case where the phrase could mean more than one thing.\n\n“in/to/into the temple”\n\nLuke uses this phrase many times in this book, but it does not refer to the temple building itself. Only priests were allowed to enter that building, so the phrase refers to the courtyard or area around the temple. The phrase “in the porch that is called Solomon’s” in 3:11 makes it clear that Peter and John and the crowd that gathered on the occasion that chapter describes were not inside the temple building. Notes will address this phrase to explain its meaning each time it occurs in the book.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Acts?\n\nThe following are the most significant textual issues in Acts. Notes will address them where they occur in the book.\n\nFirst, there are some verses that are found in traditional versions of the Bible, but they are not found in the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. Some modern versions put these verses in square brackets \[ \]. The ULT and UST also put them in brackets. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider including these verses if that translation does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that these verses may not be original. You could put them in brackets, for example, or in footnotes. These verses are:\n- Acts 8:37, “Philip said, ‘If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized.’ The Ethiopian answered, ‘I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.’”\n- Acts 15:34, “But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.”\n- Acts 24:6–8, “And we wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias, the officer, came and forcibly took him out of our hands, sending him to you.”\n- Acts 28:29, “When he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.”\n\nSecond, in some verses, it is uncertain what the original text said. The ULT uses the first readings listed below, but it includes the second readings in footnotes. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider following the same reading that it does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the same reading that ULT does. These verses are:\n- Acts 3:22, “the Lord our God.” Some versions read “the Lord your God,” and other versions read “the Lord God.”\n- Acts 7:46, “a dwelling for the house of Jacob.” Some versions read “for the God of Jacob.”\n- Acts 10:19, “three men.” Some versions read “two men” or “some men.”\n- Acts 10:30, “Four days ago, at this hour, I was praying at the ninth {hour} in my house.” Some versions read, “From the fourth day until this hour, I was fasting, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house.”\n- Acts 12:25, “They returned from Jerusalem.” Some versions read, “They returned to Jerusalem” (or “to there”).\n- Acts 13:18, “he put up with them.” Some versions read, “he cared for them.”\n- Acts 15:17–18, “This is what the Lord says, who has done these things that have been known from ancient times.” Some older versions read, “This is what the Lord says, to whom are known all his deeds from ancient times.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	vyg9				0	# Acts 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe UST has set the words “Dear Theophilus” apart from the other words. This is because English speakers often start letters this way. You may want to start this book in the way that people start letters in your culture.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the two quotations from the book of Psalms in 1:20.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Ascension\n\nThis chapter records an event that is commonly known as the “Ascension.” That word describes how Jesus returned to heaven after he became alive again. In the future he will come back to earth again, and his return to earth is known as his “Second Coming.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/resurrection]])\n\n### Baptism\n\nLuke uses the word “baptize” with two different meanings in [1:5](../01/05.md). In the first instance, it refers literally to the water baptism of John. In the second instance, it refers to people being filled with the Holy Spirit. Luke uses the term “filled” to mean this same thing in [2:4](../02/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])\n\n### “He spoke things concerning the kingdom of God”\n\nSome scholars believe that when Jesus spoke “things concerning the kingdom of God,” as Luke describes in [1:3](../01/03.md), he explained to the disciples why the kingdom of God had not come while he was on earth the first time. Other scholars believe that the kingdom of God did begin while Jesus was on earth and that Jesus explained that it had come in a form different from the one the disciples had expected. Since Christians hold different views about the kingdom of God coming, translators should be careful to avoid letting how they understand that issue affect how they translate this verse.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Long sentence\n\nAs was common in compositions of this time, for stylistic purposes Luke begins this book with a very long sentence. It goes from the beginning of [1:1](../01/01.md) to the end of [1:3](../01/03.md). ULT represents all of this as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\n### The details of the death of Judas\n\nThere are some differences in detail between the way Luke describes the death of Judas in the book of Acts and the way Matthew describes it in his gospel. Luke says that Judas used the money he got for betraying Jesus to buy a field; Matthew says that Judas returned the money to the Jewish leaders and that they bought the field with it. Luke says that Judas killed himself by falling onto the field from a height; Matthew says that Judas hanged himself. Luke says that the field was named the “Field of Blood” because Judas died a bloody death there; Matthew says the field was given that name because it was purchased with “blood money,” that is, money paid to ensure someone’s death.\n\nIt is possible to reconcile many of these details. For example, the body of Judas may have fallen and split open on the field if he fell when he tried to hang himself. Luke may say that Judas bought the field because the Jewish leaders would not take back the money that they had paid him, and so in a sense it was still his money when the field was purchased with it.\n\nBut it would probably be best to avoid trying to reconcile these details within your translation. For example, when Luke says in [1:18](../01/18.md) that Judas fell onto the field, instead of saying that he fell when he was trying to hang himself, you could let Luke and Matthew each tell the story the way they do. Then you can leave it up to preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain how their accounts are compatible.\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThere is one small difference between the list of the 12 disciples that Matthew and Mark provide in their gospels and the list that Luke provides in his gospel and in the book of Acts.\n\nAll three writers list Simon Peter and his brother Andrew; James and John, the two sons of Zebedee; Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot. But Matthew and Mark say that the twelfth disciple was Thaddeus, while Luke says he was Judas the son of James. However, it is quite likely that Thaddeus was another name by which this other Judas was known.\n\nOnce again it is not necessary to try to reconcile these details within your translation. Specifically, in [1:13](../01/13.md) instead of saying, “Judas the son of James, who was also known as Thaddeus,” you can let each of the biblical writers tell the story in the way that they do. Then you can leave it up to preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain how their accounts are compatible.
1:1	q9ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν μὲν πρῶτον λόγον ἐποιησάμην	1	Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that by **the first account** he means the book that has become known as the Gospel of Luke. Since that book was not known by that title at this time, it would not be accurate to put the title in your translation as a name that Luke would have used to describe the book to Theophilus. However, you could explain this in a footnote and use another expression here. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my first volume” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:1	a000			ὦ Θεόφιλε	1	Here Luke is identifying and addressing the man for whom he complied this account of the early church. Since this is like the salutation of a letter, in your translation you may wish to follow your culture’s way of identifying and greeting the addressee of a letter. UST models this by saying “Dear Theophilus” and putting the phrase at the beginning of the sentence.
1:1	ryj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Θεόφιλε	1	**Theophilus** is the name of a man. It means “friend of God.” It may be his actual name, or it may describe what this man was like. Most translations treat it as his name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:1	a001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	περὶ πάντων & ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς ποιεῖν τε καὶ διδάσκειν	1	Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that Jesus had been doing something else (working as a carpenter) but then began to do something new when he started his ministry. In your language, it might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it might seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express. Alternate translation: “all that Jesus both did and taught” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1:1	a002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	περὶ πάντων & ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς ποιεῖν τε καὶ διδάσκειν	1	This is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “about some of the most important things that Jesus did and taught” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:2	a003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄχρι ἧς ἡμέρας	1	While this did happen on a specific day, Luke is likely using the word **day** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “up to the time when” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:2	n435		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀνελήμφθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:2	a424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνελήμφθη	1	Luke is referring to Jesus being **taken up** into heaven. See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “he was taken up into heaven” or “God took him up into heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:3	a004			οἷς καὶ παρέστησεν ἑαυτὸν ζῶντα, μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν αὐτὸν, ἐν πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις	1	As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Jesus also presented himself alive with many proofs to his apostles after he had suffered”
1:3	dup3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν αὐτὸν	1	This refers to how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. Alternate translation: “after he had suffered and died on the cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:3	a005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις	1	The word translated **proofs** describes items of evidence that are decisive and convincing. Alternate translation: “with many definitive proofs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:3	yc16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δι’ ἡμερῶν τεσσεράκοντα, ὀπτανόμενος αὐτοῖς, καὶ λέγων	1	While the antecedent of **whom** is “the apostles whom he had chosen” in the previous verse, Jesus actually appeared to many other disciples besides his apostles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “For 40 days he appeared to his apostles and many of his other disciples, and he spoke” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:3	a006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὰ περὶ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See the discussion of the concept of the **kingdom of God** in Part 2 of the General Introduction to Acts. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express this with a verb such as “rule,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:4	a007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων, μὴ χωρίζεσθαι, ἀλλὰ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **depart**. Alternate translation: “to remain in Jerusalem and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1:4	vb7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων, μὴ χωρίζεσθαι	1	The content of Jesus’ instructions to the apostles on this occasion begins here. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate and punctuate the material from here to the end of the verse as a direct quotation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1:4	sg4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	Jesus is referring to the Holy Spirit by association with the way God made a **promise** to send the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit, whom the Father promised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:4	a009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “of God the Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:4	tj6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἣν ἠκούσατέ μου	1	In keeping with his engaging storytelling style, Luke begins a quotation from Jesus here without introducing it with a formula such as “he said.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include an introductory formula in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said, ‘You heard about this from me’” or “He said, ‘I told you about this’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1:4	d3kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ἠκούσατέ	1	Here, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the apostles, so use the plural form of “you” in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In [1:6](../01/06.md), “you” is singular because Jesus alone is being addressed, so the singular form would be accurate there. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context, but they will address ambiguous cases where this may not be clear. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
1:5	fnq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	Jesus is referring to the man who was known as John the Baptist because he baptized people. It may help to identify him if you use that title after his name in your translation. However, because the word “Baptist” is associated with a group of churches in many parts of the world, it may be helpful to your readers to use a different form of the word as a title, as UST does by saying “Baptizer.” Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” or “John the Baptizer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:5	a075		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς & ἐν Πνεύματι βαπτισθήσεσθε Ἁγίῳ	1	After describing earlier in the verse how John baptized people literally, Jesus is using baptism in this second instance as a metaphor. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will come and empower you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:5	dzj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑμεῖς & βαπτισθήσεσθε	1	You may wish to retain the metaphor of baptism in your translation. If you do, and If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will baptize” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:5	a010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μετὰ πολλὰς ταύτας ἡμέρας	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “just a few days from now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1:6	n9wt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ μὲν οὖν συνελθόντες, ἠρώτων αὐτὸν	1	In the first instance, **they** describes Jesus and the apostles, while in the second instance, **they** refers to the apostles. (Other disciples could have been present on this occasion, but the instructions that Jesus gives about being “witnesses” in [1:8](../01/08.md) apply specifically to the apostles, so it would be good to name them directly.) Alternate translation: “When the apostles were together with Jesus, the apostles were asking him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:6	a011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ, ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	This is an idiomatic way of asking a question. Alternate translation: “are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time” or “will you now restore the kingdom to Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:6	f7uj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰ & ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express the same idea with a noun such as “king.” Alternate translation: “are you going to give Israel its own king again” or “are you going to become the restored king of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:7	a012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐχ ὑμῶν ἐστιν γνῶναι	1	Jesus is saying implicitly by this response that he is not going to tell the apostles when the thing they are asking about will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “I am not going to tell you when that will happen, because it is not for you to know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:7	y1fu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	χρόνους ἢ καιροὺς	1	The words **times** and **seasons** could: (1) refer to different kinds of time. Alternate translation: “the general period of time or the specific date” (2) have similar meanings, being used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the exact time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:7	a013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατὴρ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:7	a014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **authority**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “control.” Alternate translation: “as the one who controls all things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:8	ld4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	λήμψεσθε δύναμιν, ἐπελθόντος τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἔσεσθέ μου μάρτυρες	1	Jesus is using the word translated **and** to describe a result. Alternate translation: “when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, then you will receive power to be my witnesses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:8	a015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δύναμιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **power**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “powerful.” Alternate translation: “powerful ability” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:8	vb4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς	1	This is a reference to place, not to time. Jesus does not mean “until the world ends.” Alternate translation: “all over the world” or “to the places on the earth that are farthest away from here” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:9	e1q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βλεπόντων αὐτῶν	1	Your language may require you to specify the object of **looking**. Alternate translation: “as they were looking at him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:9	l1cq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπήρθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. (See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter.) Alternate translation: “he rose up” or “God raised him up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:9	ug58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν	1	Luke is using the **eyes** of the apostles to mean their capacity to see. Alternate translation: “from their sight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:10	enu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀτενίζοντες ἦσαν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	Since a cloud was able to block the apostles’ view, it is clear that Luke is using the word translated **heaven** here in one of its specific senses to mean “sky.” It would be good to make clear that the apostles were not seeing into heaven itself. Alternate translation: “gazing at the sky” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:10	a017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες δύο	1	Luke is using the term **behold** to focus readers’ attention on how suddenly these **two men** appeared. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “just then two men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:10	a018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to indicate that the event of the men appearing happened after the event of Jesus going up. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
1:10	a019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄνδρες δύο	1	These were actually angels. Luke calls them **men** because they appeared in human form. Alternate translation: “two angels” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:10	a020			ἐσθήσεσι λευκαῖς	1	In this context, the word **white** likely has the specific sense of “bright” or “shining.” Alternate translation: “bright clothes” or “shining clothes”
1:11	a021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἳ & εἶπαν	1	This could mean: (1) one of the angels had spoken on behalf of both of them. Alternate translation: “one of them said” (2) the two angels had each said different parts of the quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:11	a022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	οἳ & εἶπαν	1	If you retain the word **they** in your translation and if your language uses dual forms for verbs, it would be accurate to use the dual form here, since two men are speaking. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
1:11	gpg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Γαλιλαῖοι	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You Galileans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:11	a024		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἑστήκατε βλέποντες εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν?	1	The angels are not looking for information. They are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “there is no reason for you to stand looking into heaven!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1:11	a025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τί ἑστήκατε βλέποντες	1	The expression **stand** means to continue doing something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “why do you keep looking” or “there is no reason for you to keep looking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:11	a026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς ἀφ’ ὑμῶν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν & ἐθεάσασθε αὐτὸν πορευόμενον εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	In its second occurrence in this sentence, the term translated **heaven** likely means “the sky,” as in the previous sentence and in the previous verse. However, in its first occurrence in this sentence, the term likely means “heaven” itself. It would not be accurate to say that Jesus was just “taken up from you into the sky.” Alternate translation: “who has been taken up from you into heaven … you saw him going into the sky” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:11	a027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “whom God has taken up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:11	cue7			ὃν τρόπον	1	Alternate translation: “in the same way in which”
1:12	x2nk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὑπέστρεψαν	1	The word **they** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “the apostles returned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:12	a028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὄρους τοῦ καλουμένου Ἐλαιῶνος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the hill that people call Olivet” or “the hill whose name is Olivet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:12	a029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ὄρους τοῦ καλουμένου Ἐλαιῶνος	1	**Olivet** is the name of a hill. If your readers might recognize it better if you called it the Mount of Olives, you could use that name in your translation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:12	a030		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν	1	The expression **having a journey** refers to a distance. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a Sabbath-day’s journey away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:12	p19g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	Σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν	1	The **journey of a Sabbath** was the distance that interpreters of the law of Moses had determined people could walk on the Sabbath without that being “work.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the distance in the measurement that your culture uses. Alternate translation: “about a kilometer away” or “about half a mile away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:13	vis2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτε εἰσῆλθον	1	The previous verse explains that the apostles returned to Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that again explicitly here. Alternate translation: “when they arrived back in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:13	zt12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εἰς τὸ ὑπερῷον, ἀνέβησαν οὗ ἦσαν καταμένοντες	1	In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built on top of other rooms. The expression **upper chamber** describes such a room, which was reached by stairs. If your culture does not have houses like that, it may be helpful to explain the meaning of the expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “they climbed the stairs to the room where they were staying, which had been built on top of other rooms in the house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:13	a032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Ἰάκωβος Ἁλφαίου & Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου	1	These are two occurrences of an idiom. Alternate translation: “James the son of Alphaeus … Judas the son of James” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:13	a033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰάκωβος & Ἁλφαίου & Ἰούδας & Ἰακώβου	1	These are the names of four men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:13	a034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σίμων ὁ Ζηλωτὴς	1	**Simon** is the name of a man, and **Zealot** is another name by which he was known. (1) **Zealot** could be a title that indicates that this man was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. Alternate translation: “Simon the Patriot” (2) **Zealot** could also be a description that indicates that this man was zealous for God to be honored. Alternate translation: “Simon the Passionate One” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names)
1:14	z6cf			ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. Alternate translation: “with one accord” or “harmoniously”
1:14	a035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γυναιξὶν	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to the women who accompanied Jesus and his disciples during his ministry. These women provided for them out of their own means, and they had traveled with them to Jerusalem. These women are described in [Luke 8:2–3](../luk/08/02.md) and [23:49](../luk/23/49.md). Alternate translation: “the women who had helped Jesus and his disciples during his ministry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:14	a037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ	1	These were Jesus’ younger brothers. They were the sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you may wish to use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
1:15	il8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. The phrase refers to the period of time after Jesus ascended, when the disciples were meeting in the upper chamber. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
1:15	cup2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Luke is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “during that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:15	a038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1	Peter **stood up** to indicate that he had something important to say. Alternate translation: “having stood up to show that he had something important to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
1:15	liz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. Alternate translation: “his fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:15	a039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Luke is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. As the General Introduction to Acts suggests, here and throughout the book, if you retain this figurative usage in your translation, you could state “brothers and sisters” to indicate that it has this generic sense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:15	tl5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἦν τε ὄχλος ὀνομάτων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ὡς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι	1	Luke provides this background information to help readers appreciate what happens shortly afterwards in the story, when the church grows in one day to many times this size. It may be helpful to put this background information first in the verse as a separate sentence, in which case it would not have to be in parentheses. Alternate translation: “Now the number of people in that one place was about 120.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:15	a040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὄχλος ὀνομάτων	1	Luke is using the term **names** to mean “people,” by association with the way that people have names. Alternate translation: “the number of people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:15	a041			ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in that one place” or “in their Christian fellowship”
1:16	a042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:16	a043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “My fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:16	a045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἔδει πληρωθῆναι τὴν Γραφὴν, ἣν προεῖπε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον διὰ στόματος Δαυεὶδ περὶ Ἰούδα, τοῦ γενομένου ὁδηγοῦ τοῖς συλλαβοῦσιν Ἰησοῦν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put the information that Peter provides to identify this **scripture** before his statement that it had to be **fulfilled**. It may be helpful to make that statement a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus. It was necessary for that scripture to be fulfilled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1:16	i8tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἔδει πληρωθῆναι τὴν Γραφὴν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the things needed to take place that the scripture described” or, if you put the background information first as a separate sentence, “What that scripture described needed to take place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:16	a046			προεῖπε	1	Alternate translation: “spoke beforehand” or “spoke in advance”
1:16	f3um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ στόματος Δαυεὶδ	1	Peter is using the word **mouth** to refer to words that David spoke or sang using his mouth and that he recorded in the book of Psalms, as Peter indicates in [1:20](../01/20.md). Alternate translation: “through the words of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:16	a048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τοῦ γενομένου ὁδηγοῦ τοῖς συλλαβοῦσιν Ἰησοῦν	1	Peter is using the act of guiding **the ones arresting Jesus** to represent all of the things that Judas did to betray Jesus. This also included meeting beforehand with his enemies, receiving payment for the betrayal, and looking for the best opportunity to catch Jesus away from the crowds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in more general terms. Alternate translation: “who betrayed Jesus to his enemies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1:17	q73y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Peter uses the word **For** to introduce the reason for a result that is described in [1:21–22](../01/21.md), after Luke provides further background information and Peter quotes the scripture he referred to in [1:16](../01/16.md). The overall meaning is, “Since Judas was one of us apostles, we need to replace him with another witness of the ministry of Jesus.” But since so much material comes between the reason and the result, it may be helpful to give an indication here that Peter has a response in mind. Alternate translation: “There is something important we need to do in response to this scripture being fulfilled, since” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:17	a049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν, καὶ ἔλαχεν τὸν κλῆρον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης	1	These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “Jesus chose him to be an apostle along with us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:17	a050			κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν	1	Peter is using the term **numbered** in one of its specific senses. Alternate translation: “he was considered to be one of us apostles”
1:17	a051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he belonged to our group of apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:17	tmv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐν ἡμῖν	1	Although Peter is addressing a larger group of people, he is using the word **us** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **us** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “with us apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:17	a052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τὸν κλῆρον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης	1	Luke temporarily ends his quotation from Peter after this phrase so that he can provide further background information about Judas in [1:18–19](../01/18.md). The quotation resumes in [1:20](../01/20.md). If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an ending quotation mark or the equivalent after this phrase. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1:18	tmv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	μὲν οὖν	1	Luke is using this expression to introduce further background information that he provides in this verse and the next one about how Judas died and about what people called the field where he died. This is not part of Peter’s speech. You may want to indicate that by putting these verses in parentheses or by using the equivalent convention in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:18	dd58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οὗτος	1	Luke is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Judas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state “he” or use the name “Judas.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:18	a053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **unrighteousness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “unrighteous.” Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for doing an unrighteous deed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:18	w83j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	Luke is using the term **unrighteousness** to describe Judas betraying Jesus, by association with the way that was an unrighteous thing to do. Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for betraying Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:18	kg3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρηνὴς γενόμενος	1	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that Judas did not fall down accidentally. Rather, he threw himself onto the field intentionally in order to kill himself. The implications are that he must have done this from a height. Alternate translation: “because he then threw himself down from a height onto that field” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:18	a054			πρηνὴς γενόμενος	1	The word **headfirst** describes someone falling forward, as opposed to falling backwards. Alternate translation: “having fallen forward”
1:18	a055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξεχύθη πάντα τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “all his inward parts poured out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:19	a056			γνωστὸν ἐγένετο πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	The verb form is not passive here, since **known** is an adjective rather than a participle. Even so, it may be helpful to your readers to make **it** the object rather than the subject. Alternate translation: “all those living in Jerusalem heard about it”
1:19	a057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	γνωστὸν ἐγένετο πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “it became well known to those living in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:19	a058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὥστε κληθῆναι τὸ χωρίον ἐκεῖνο	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “So they called that field” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:19	mxf3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἁκελδαμάχ	1	**Akeldama** is an Aramaic word. Luke spells it out using Greek letters so his readers will know how it sounds, and then he says what it means, **Field of Blood**. In your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
1:20	mz13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	γέγραπται γὰρ	1	Luke now resumes his quotation of what Peter said on this occasion. If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an opening quotation mark or the equivalent before this phrase. It may also be helpful to indicate explicitly that the quotation resumes here. Alternate translation: “Peter went on to say, ‘For it is written’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1:20	d7pk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται & ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν, γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ; καί, τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “it is written in the book of Psalms that his habitation should be made desolate, with no one dwelling in it, and that another should take his overseership” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
1:20	ip5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται & ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “David wrote in the book of Psalms” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:20	g30d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May his habitation become desolate, and may no one be dwelling in it” or “His habitation should become desolate, and no one should be dwelling be in it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
1:20	crk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. The psalmist is asking God to judge and punish the wicked. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please let his habitation become desolate, and please let no one be dwelling in it” or “Please may his habitation become desolate, and please may no one be dwelling in it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1:20	hiul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative. Alternate translation: “God, please make his habitation desolate, and please make no one dwell in it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:20	mc45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Or you could combine the phrases if you think that would be the clearest thing to do. Alternate translation: “Let his habitation be made desolate, yes, let no one dwell in it” or “Let his habitation be made completely desolate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:20	chq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	The word **habitation** likely refers to Judas’ home and is a metaphor for his family line. Alternate translation: “May he leave no descendants, none to continue his family line” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:20	a059			τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	The word **overseership** refers to a position of leadership and supervision. It is the same term that Paul uses for a spiritual leader in [1 Timothy 3:1](../1ti/03/01.md). Alternate translation: “Let someone else take his leadership position”
1:20	uctm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May another take his overseership” or “Another should take his overseership” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
1:20	jdsg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. The psalmist is continuing God to judge and punish the wicked. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please let another take his overseership” or “Please may another take his overseership” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1:20	elz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative. Alternate translation: “God, make another take his overseership” or “God, please give his overseership to another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:21	t916		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	To help your readers understand Peter’s main point in this verse and the next one, you could combine both verses into a verse bridge. You could put his main point in a first sentence and his further explanation in a second sentence. Alternate translation: “Therefore it is necessary for someone else to become a witness with us of Jesus’ resurrection. It should be one of the men who accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
1:21	xz69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν & ἡμᾶς	1	In the first instance of **us**, Peter means himself and his fellow apostles, not everyone to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of the word if your language marks that distinction. However, in the second instance of **us**, Peter could well mean himself and his entire audience, so use the inclusive form in that instance. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:21	zuf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς ὁ Κύριος Ἰησοῦς	1	Peter is speaking in an idiomatic way. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus lived among us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:22	qb8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τοῦ βαπτίσματος Ἰωάννου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **baptism**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “baptize.” Alternate translation: “beginning from when John started baptizing people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:22	a061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς	1	While Jesus was taken up to heaven on a specific **day**, Peter may be using the word **day** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “the time when” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:22	a062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀνελήμφθη & τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, not to John the Baptist. The pronoun **his** also refers to Jesus. For clarity, you may want to use the name Jesus instead of one or both of these pronouns. Alternate translation: “Jesus was taken up … the resurrection of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:22	yi3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀνελήμφθη ἀφ’ ἡμῶν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up from us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:22	a063		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀφ’ ἡμῶν & σὺν ἡμῖν	1	When Peter says **from us**, he is referring to God taking Jesus from everyone to whom he is speaking. But when Peter says **with us**, he means only himself and the other apostles. So the word “us” would be inclusive in the first instance and exclusive in the second instance, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:22	mrx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἕνα τούτων	1	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **these** as a noun to refer to specific people, the men whose qualifications he has just described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “one of these men is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:22	g3n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “that God made him alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:23	lz7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔστησαν δύο	1	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers who were present on this occasion. This is the group that Luke describes as “the brothers” in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:23	a064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἔστησαν δύο	1	Luke is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, two men who met the qualifications Peter described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning, and you could also describe these men more specifically. Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two men” or “the believers stood up two men who met the qualifications that Peter described” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:23	a065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἔστησαν δύο	1	When the believers **stood up** these two men, that is, when they had them stand up within the group, this was a symbolic way of proposing them as candidates to replace Judas. Alternate translation: “the believers proposed two men who met the qualifications that Peter described” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
1:23	a066		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ & Βαρσαββᾶν & Ἰοῦστος	1	**Joseph** is the name of a man, and **Barsabbas** and **Justus** are two other names by which he was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. **Justus** is a Roman name, and it may be a name that this man used for official purposes and in interactions with people who spoke Latin. (It would be like the name Paul, by which Saul of Tarsus was also known in the Roman Empire.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:23	s1ff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν καλούμενον Βαρσαββᾶν, ὃς ἐπεκλήθη Ἰοῦστος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state both of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “whom people called Barsabbas and whose other name was Justus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:23	a067		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαθθίαν	1	**Matthias** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:24	a068		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	Judas betrayed Jesus and abandoned his position as an apostle. The person who is praying says that in the next verse. As a result, the believers are asking God to show them whom he has chosen to replace Judas, as the person praying says in this verse. You could put the reason before the result by creating a verse bridge. UST provides a model for doing that. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
1:24	a069		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	προσευξάμενοι, εἶπαν	1	Together the words **praying** and **said** indicate that the believers said what they did while praying. Alternate translation: “they said in prayer” or “they prayed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1:24	zd1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	προσευξάμενοι, εἶπαν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers, but one of the apostles alone probably spoke these words on behalf of everyone. Alternate translation: “as the believers were all praying together, one of the apostles said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1:24	a070			σὺ Κύριε, καρδιογνῶστα πάντων	1	Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all people”
1:24	se6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σὺ Κύριε, καρδιογνῶστα πάντων	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the thoughts and motives of all people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:24	a071		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	σὺ Κύριε	1	The word **you** is singular because the person who is praying is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form in your translation. However, it might be more natural in your language for someone who has a good, close relationship with God to address God using the informal form of “you.” Use your best judgment about what form to use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
1:24	a072		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὃν ἐξελέξω ἐκ τούτων τῶν δύο ἕνα	1	The person who is praying is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, the two men whom the believers have proposed. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “which one of these two men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:25	mg47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	λαβεῖν τὸν τόπον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης καὶ ἀποστολῆς	1	The person who is praying is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **apostleship** identifies what kind of **ministry** this is. Alternate translation: “to take this place of apostolic ministry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1:25	ryv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀφ’ ἧς παρέβη Ἰούδας	1	The expression **turned aside** means that Judas stopped performing this ministry. Alternate translation: “which Judas stopped fulfilling” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:25	tx6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	πορευθῆναι εἰς τὸν τόπον τὸν ἴδιον	1	This phrase uses a mild expression to describe Judas’ death and likely also his judgment after death. Alternate translation: “and died under God’s judgment as a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1:26	a073		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the believers did as a result of Peter’s speech. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:26	r84c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔδωκαν κλήρους αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the believers and the pronoun **them** refers to Joseph and Matthias. You may want to specify that for clarity. (But if you decide to retain the pronoun **them** and if your language marks the dual form, **them** would be dual because it refers to those two men.) Alternate translation: “the believers cast lots to decide between Joseph and Matthias” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:26	a074		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἔδωκαν κλήρους αὐτοῖς	1	The term **lots** describes objects with various markings on different sides that were used, most likely by dropping them on the ground, to select between possibilities. The belief was that God would control which way these objects fell and so guide the selection process. Alternate translation: “they threw marked objects on the ground, trusting that God would use these to guide them whether to choose Joseph or Matthias” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:26	w4ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἔπεσεν ὁ κλῆρος ἐπὶ Μαθθίαν	1	The word **fell** means “selected.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the lot selected Matthias” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:26	fk4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνκατεψηφίσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the believers chose him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:intro	x8fr				0	# Acts 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set lines of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:17–21, 25–28, and 34–35.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the material that is quoted in 2:31.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Pentecost\n\nThe events described in this chapter took place on the day of Pentecost. That was a festival that the Jews observed each year 50 days after Passover. It was a harvest festival that celebrated the first produce from the fields. That produce was known as “firstfruits.” Many people believe that the church began to exist when the Holy Spirit came to live inside believers on this particular day of Pentecost. Those believers were the “firstfruits” of all those who would become part of the church down through the years.\n\n### Tongues\n\nLuke uses the Greek word “tongues” to mean two different things in this chapter. In 2:3, Luke describes what came down from heaven as “tongues as if of fire.” A “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire” (as in Isaiah 5:24, for example), so this means “something like flames of fire.” In 2:4, Luke uses the word “tongues” in the different sense of “languages” to describe the languages that the people spoke after the Holy Spirit filled them. For clarity, ULT translates the use in 2:3 as “tongues” and the use in 2:4 as “languages.”\n\n### Last days\n\nIn 2:17–21, Peter quotes a prophecy from Joel that describes something that will happen in the “last days.” Some scholars understand the “last days” to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. Other scholars understand the “last days” to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this expression where it occurs in 2:17. It may be best not to say more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])\n\n### The prophecy of Joel\n\nIn 2:17–21, Peter quotes a prophecy of Joel about what would happen in the “last days.” Some of the things that prophecy describes did happen on the day of Pentecost, for example, the pouring out of the Spirit (2:17–18). Some other things did not happen, at least not literally, for example, the sun turning to darkness (2:20). Depending on how scholars understand the “last days,” they may say either that these other things await a literal future fulfillment or that they were fulfilled in some spiritual sense on the day of Pentecost. Once again it may be best not to say any more than ULT does and to allow preachers and teachers of the Bible to interpret and explain the meaning of Peter’s statement in 2:16, “this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n### Baptize\n\nIn this chapter, the word “baptize” refers to water baptism as an expression of faith in Jesus for the forgiveness of sins. That is how Luke uses the term in 2:38 and 2:41. Jesus did promise the disciples in 1:5 that they would be baptized in the Holy Spirit, and the events that Luke describes in 2:1–11 are the fulfillment of that promise. But Luke does not use the word “baptize” to describe those events in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])\n\n### Wonders and signs\n\nThese words refer to things that only God could do that showed that Jesus was who the disciples said he was. See the notes to this expression in 2:43.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “You killed” (2:23)\n\nThe Romans were the ones who killed Jesus, but they killed him because the Jews captured him, brought him to the Romans, and urged the Romans to kill him. For this reason Peter tells the people in the crowd on the day of Pentecost that they were guilty of killing Jesus. See the note to this phrase in 2:23 for suggestions about how to make clear in your translation what Peter means when he says this.\n\n### Long sentences\n\nThere is a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 2:9 to the end of 2:11. ULT represents all of it as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\nThere is also a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 2:44 to the end of 2:47. Once again it may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\n### Poetry\n\nThe quotations from the Old Testament in 2:17–21, 25–28, and 34–35 are poetry. For advice about how to represent this literary form in your translation, see: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]].
2:1	i4sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	Luke uses this time reference to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
2:1	a076		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “when the day of Pentecost had come” or, if your language does not speak of days “coming,” “on the day of Pentecost” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:1	a425		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to use an active form of the verb “fill” in place of the passive form of that verb here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:1	i4sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἦσαν πάντες ὁμοῦ	1	Here the word **they** refers to the apostles and the other 120 believers whom Luke mentions in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “the apostles and all the other believers were together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:1	a077			ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “in united Christian fellowship”
2:2	qjc3			ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	The word translated **heaven** could mean: (1) “the sky.” Alternate translation: “from the sky” (2) the sound came from **heaven** itself.
2:2	a078		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὥσπερ φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας	1	Luke is using a simile to describe what this wind was like. You could use the same simile in your translation, or you could use a different comparison, to a similar loud sound that your readers would recognize. It may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It sounded like a strong wind being borne along” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:2	jec5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας	1	Luke speaks of the wind as if it were being carried through the air. Alternate translation: “a mighty, rushing wind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:2	a079		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπλήρωσεν ὅλον τὸν οἶκον	1	Luke speaks of this sound as if it **filled** the **house**. Alternate translation: “it could be heard throughout the house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:2	t4y4			ὅλον τὸν οἶκον	1	Luke may be using the word translated **house** in one of its specific senses to mean a building. So this could have been either a private home or a larger building. Alternate translation: “the entire building”
2:2	a080		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὗ ἦσαν καθήμενοι	1	Luke may be using the term **sitting** to mean “meeting.” Alternate translation: “in which they were meeting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:3	re3t			γλῶσσαι ὡσεὶ πυρός	1	This phrase means “something like tongues of fire,” and a “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire.” (The expression is used with that meaning in [Isaiah 5:24](../isa/05/24.md), for example.) This is not a simile. Luke is describing what these objects looked like. Alternate translation: “objects that looked like flames of fire”
2:3	xtk4			διαμεριζόμεναι	1	This means that the objects that looked like flames of fire spread out so that there was one on each person. Alternate translation: “spreading around”
2:3	a081		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐκάθισεν ἐφ’ ἕνα ἕκαστον αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the objects, and the pronoun **them** refers to the disciples. Alternate translation: “one of the objects sat upon each one of the disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:3	a082		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκάθισεν ἐφ’ ἕνα ἕκαστον αὐτῶν	1	Luke is using the word **sat** to indicate that the objects remained in one place once they had spread around. Alternate translation: “one of the objects remained on each one of the disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	v7hi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπλήσθησαν πάντες Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled them all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:4	a251		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθησαν πάντες Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	Luke is speaking as if the believers were containers that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “they were all inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “the Holy Spirit inspired them all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	a083		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἤρξαντο λαλεῖν ἑτέραις γλώσσαις	1	Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that the disciples had been doing something else (speaking in their own languages) but then began to do something new when the Holy Spirit filled them. It might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it may seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express in your language. Alternate translation: “they spoke in other languages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
2:4	nr9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤρξαντο λαλεῖν ἑτέραις γλώσσαις	1	The implication, as [2:6–11](../02/06.md) makes clear, is that the disciples were speaking languages that they did not know. Alternate translation: “they began to speak in languages that they did not know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	a084			καθὼς τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐδίδου ἀποφθέγγεσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	Here, **giving** has the sense of enabling. Alternate translation: “as the Spirit was enabling them to speak out”
2:4	a085			καθὼς τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐδίδου ἀποφθέγγεσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	The word translated **to speak out** means to speak clearly and articulately. To express this meaning, it may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The Spirit was enabling them to speak these languages clearly and articulately”
2:5	dz1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. You can translate it with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
2:5	yft2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνδρες εὐλαβεῖς	1	Luke is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “godly people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:5	stq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	παντὸς ἔθνους	1	The word **every** is a generalization that emphasizes that the people came from many different nations. Alternate translation: “many different nations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:5	a086		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	The expression **under heaven** is a way of referring to being on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:6	bpj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνεχύθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state what did the action. Alternate translation: “what they heard confused them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:6	u9hc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἤκουον εἷς ἕκαστος τῇ ἰδίᾳ διαλέκτῳ λαλούντων αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the believers and the pronoun **his** refers to each person in the multitude. Alternate translation: “each person in the multitude could hear one of the disciples speaking in that person’s own language” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:7	m8kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐξίσταντο & καὶ ἐθαύμαζον	1	The terms **amazed** and **marveling** mean similar things. Luke may be using the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “they were … greatly amazed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:7	a087		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξίσταντο & πάντες καὶ ἐθαύμαζον	1	The expression **were … amazed** is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed all of them and they were marveling” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:7	a088		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	**Behold** is an expression that speakers use to focus the attention of their listeners on what they are about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” the term can be used to get people to pay attention. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “In fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	wnk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχ & ἅπαντες οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ λαλοῦντες Γαλιλαῖοι	1	The speakers are not looking for information. They are using the question form to express their amazement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “all of these people who are speaking are Galileans!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:8	hzm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καὶ πῶς ἡμεῖς ἀκούομεν ἕκαστος τῇ ἰδίᾳ διαλέκτῳ ἡμῶν, ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν?	1	The speakers do not expect someone to be able to answer this question for them. Rather, they are using the question form to express their amazement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “So we should not each be hearing them speak in our own languages in which we were born!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:8	a090		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	The speakers are using the word translated **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:8	a091		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πῶς ἡμεῖς ἀκούομεν ἕκαστος	1	Your language may require you to specify the object of **hearing**. Alternate translation: “how are we each hearing them speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:8	a092		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & ἡμῶν	1	The speakers are using the words **we** and **our** to refer to themselves and to their listeners, so use the inclusive forms of those words if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:8	wb5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν	1	The speakers say that they **were born** in these languages to mean that they learned them from birth. Alternate translation: “that we learned from birth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:8	a093		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. However, since this is a metaphor, it would be preferable to use another expression to explain its meaning, rather than to say something like “in which our mothers gave birth to us.” Alternate translation: “that we learned from birth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:9	f1ve		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Πάρθοι & Μῆδοι & Ἐλαμεῖται	1	These are names of three people groups. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:9	dm23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν, Ἰουδαίαν & Καππαδοκίαν, Πόντον & Ἀσίαν	1	These are names of five areas. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:10	tmb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Φρυγίαν & Παμφυλίαν, Αἴγυπτον & Λιβύης	1	These are names of four areas. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:11	w8jy			Ἰουδαῖοί τε καὶ προσήλυτοι	1	The term **proselytes** describes converts to the Jewish religion. The phrase **both Jews and proselytes** could apply specifically to the visitors from Rome mentioned at the end of the previous verse, or it could apply to the whole list of people in [2:9–11](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “both Jews and converts to the Jewish religion”
2:11	jnp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Κρῆτες & Ἄραβες	1	These are names of two people groups. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:11	a097		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὰ μεγαλεῖα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The speakers are using the adjective **great** as a noun. (The term is plural; ULT adds **things** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the great things that God has done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:12	el2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐξίσταντο & πάντες καὶ διηποροῦντο	1	The words **amazed** and **perplexed** mean similar things. Luke is using them together to emphasize that the people could not understand what was happening. Alternate translation: “they were very perplexed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:12	a098		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξίσταντο & πάντες καὶ διηποροῦντο & λέγοντες	1	These are not passive verbal forms. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed and perplexed all of them, and they said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:12	a099		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τί θέλει τοῦτο εἶναι	1	The expression **want to be** is a way of referring to what something means. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Or, if it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “What does this mean?” or “What is the explanation for this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:13	a100		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γλεύκους μεμεστωμένοι εἰσίν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. However, it would be preferable to use an equivalent expression that conveys the meaning rather than to say something like “sweet wine has filled them.” Alternate translation: “They have drunk their fill of sweet wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:13	fg59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γλεύκους μεμεστωμένοι εἰσίν	1	The implications of this statement are that the disciples have gotten drunk and are babbling and that this is the explanation for the languages the people think they are hearing. Alternate translation: “They have gotten drunk on sweet wine, and so what we are hearing is just drunken babbling” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	jj1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	γλεύκους	1	This refers to wine that is thicker and more intoxicating than ordinary wine. If your readers would not be familiar with this drink, you could use the name of another strong drink that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “with strong liquor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:14	k5hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	σταθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος σὺν τοῖς ἕνδεκα, ἐπῆρεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ	1	Peter **stood** to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles **stood** with him to show their support for him as he spoke. You could indicate that in your translation, perhaps as a separate sentence, if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “But Peter stood up to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles stood with him to show their support for him as he spoke. Peter raised up his voice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
2:14	c919		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἕνδεκα	1	Luke is using the adjective **eleven** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the other 11 apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:14	d9tb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐπῆρεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπεφθέγξατο αὐτοῖς	1	The idiom **raised up his voice** means that Peter spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “spoke out to them in a loud voice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:14	a102		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰουδαῖοι	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:14	a103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνδρες, Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the idiomatic form of address in your translation, follow the convention in your language that indicates a mixed group of people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:14	a104		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἰερουσαλὴμ πάντες	1	This seems to mean implicitly people who are not Jews but who live in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “all of you non-Jews who are residents of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:14	ei5j			τοῦτο ὑμῖν γνωστὸν ἔστω	1	This expression means that Peter wants to explain the meaning of what the people are seeing and hearing. Alternate translation: “let me explain this to you” or “I am going to explain this to you”
2:14	hal2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	τοῦτο ὑμῖν γνωστὸν ἔστω	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may this be known to you” or “this should be known to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
2:14	brjc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῦτο ὑμῖν γνωστὸν ἔστω	1	The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent (**you**), so you can use an active form with that agent as the implied subject. Alternate translation: “know this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:14	a105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Peter uses the word translated **and** to indicate what his listeners should do as a result of what he has just told them. Alternate translation: “so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:14	qp16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐνωτίσασθε τὰ ῥήματά μου	1	Peter is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words, and he is using the term **ears** to mean the capacity for listening. Alternate translation: “listen carefully to what I am about to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:15	a106		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Peter says **for** in this first instance to introduce the reason why the crowd should listen to him. Alternate translation: “You should listen to me because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:15	a107		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτοι	1	The demonstrative pronoun **these** refers to the disciples who are speaking different languages. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could add more information to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “these people who are speaking different languages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:15	a108		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	2	Peter says **for** in this second instance to introduce the reason why the people speaking different languages are not drunk. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They are not drunk, because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:15	a109			ἔστιν & ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “it is nine o’clock in the morning”
2:15	h28q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔστιν & ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	Peter assumes that his listeners will know that people do not get drunk that early in the day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “it is only nine o’clock in the morning, and people do not get drunk that early” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:15	a110		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “hour three of the day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
2:16	f9hz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ εἰρημένον διὰ τοῦ προφήτου Ἰωήλ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “this is what God said through the prophet Joel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:16	ktw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ εἰρημένον διὰ τοῦ προφήτου Ἰωήλ	1	The implication is that God is now making happen what he said through Joel. Alternate translation: “you are seeing God make happen what he announced earlier through the prophet Joel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	a111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις, λέγει ὁ Θεός, ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	The material in [2:17–21](../02/17.md) contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting Joel, and Joel is quoting God. You could avoid having a third-level quotation by moving the phrase **God says** to before the quotation from Joel. (The phrase itself does not occur in the passage from Joel that Peter quotes. It appears to be something that Peter supplies within the quotation to show that God is the speaker. Since that is the case, putting it before the quotation would not change the actual biblical text.) Alternate translation: “God said, ‘And it will be in the last days, I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:17	a112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις, λέγει ὁ Θεός, ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	You could also avoid having a second-level quotation by turning the direct quotation into an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that in the last days he would pour out his Spirit on all flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:17	ijl8			καὶ ἔσται	1	Alternate translation: “This is what will happen” or “This is what I will do”
2:17	a113			ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to this chapter, which recommend not interpreting or explaining it, but representing it simply as ULT does.
2:17	u2d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου	1	God says that he will **pour out** his Spirit, as if the Spirit were a liquid, to mean that he will give the Spirit generously and abundantly. Alternate translation: “I will lavish my Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:17	a114		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	God refers to **flesh** to mean people by association with the way that people are made of flesh. Alternate translation: “to all people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:17	a115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ προφητεύσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν; καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ὑμῶν ὁράσεις ὄψονται, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ὑμῶν ἐνυπνίοις ἐνυπνιασθήσονται	1	If you have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation, also do that here in the rest of the verse. It may be helpful to make this a new sentence. Alternate translation: “God said that our sons and our daughters would prophesy and our young men would see visions and our old men would dream dreams” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:17	a116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ὑμῶν	-1	If you turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation and translate these instances of **your** as “our,” use the inclusive form of the word “our” in each instance if your language marks that distinction, since Joel would be referring to himself and his listeners. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:17	a117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ νεανίσκοι & οἱ πρεσβύτεροι	1	God speaks separately of **sons** and **daughters** in this verse and of “male servants” and “female servants” in the next verse. But here the contrast is between **young** and **old**. So the word **men** could have a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “young people … old people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:18	uwd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	καί γε ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας μου, ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου, καὶ προφητεύσουσιν	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that even on his male servants and on his female servants in those days he would pour out from his Spirit, and they would prophesy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
2:18	nd34			ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας μου	1	If your language has masculine and feminine forms of the word “servant,” it would be accurate to use those forms here. Other languages can indicate this distinction in other ways, as ULT does with the adjectives “male” and “female.”
2:18	a118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Here, **days** means a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:18	wz2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ & ἐπὶ & ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου	1	See how you translated this in [2:17](../02/17.md). Alternate translation: “to … to … I will give my Spirit abundantly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:19	a119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ δώσω	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that he would give” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:19	a120			δώσω τέρατα & καὶ σημεῖα	1	Alternate translation: “I will show wonders … and signs”
2:19	a121			ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω	1	Since God specifies in the next verse that these **wonders** will affect the sun and the moon, the word translated **heaven** likely has the specific sense of “sky.” Alternate translation: “in the sky above”
2:19	p5zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἀτμίδα καπνοῦ	1	Here the possessive form describes **vapor** that looks smoky or that has **smoke** in it. Alternate translation: “smoky vapor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:20	ylv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα, πρὶν ἢ ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν Κυρίου τὴν μεγάλην καὶ ἐπιφανῆ	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that sun would be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood before the great and remarkable day of the Lord came” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:20	a6yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I will turn the sun to darkness” or, if you are making this an indirect quotation, “God said that he would turn the sun to darkness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:20	a122		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	God is speaking as if he would change the **sun** into something else. Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark” or “The sun will no longer shine brightly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	a123		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **darkness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “dark.” Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:20	a124		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and the moon will be turned to blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:20	a125		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	If you decide to supply words as the previous note suggests, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form. Alternate translation: “and I will turn the moon to blood” or, if you are making this an indirect quotation, “and that he would turn the moon to blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:20	f34k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	God is speaking as if he would change the **moon** into something else. Alternate translation: “and the moon will look like blood” or “and the moon will appear to be red” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	swb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἡμέραν & τὴν μεγάλην καὶ ἐπιφανῆ	1	The words **great** and **remarkable** mean similar things. They are being used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the very great day” or “the truly remarkable day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:20	lc4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν Κυρίου	1	This is an expression that many of the prophets use. It refers to the time when God will judge and punish people for their sins. Alternate translation: “the time when the Lord judges and punishes people for their sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:20	a126		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν Κυρίου	1	In this expression, God is speaking of himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person in your translation. Alternate translation: “time arrives when I judge and punish people for their sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2:21	a127		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου σωθήσεται	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “And God said it would happen that everyone who called on the name of the Lord would be saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:21	a128			καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς	1	Alternate translation: “And this is what will happen: Everyone”
2:21	vql5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου σωθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Lord will save everyone who calls on his name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:21	a129		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται	1	The expression **call on** means to make an appeal. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everyone who may appeal to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:21	a130		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου	1	God is speaking of himself in the third person.

If you chose to mark the Lord’s words as a third-level quotation, indicate that ending here with a closing third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. It is also the end of Peter’s quotation of Joel. If you chose to mark Joel’s words as a second-level quotation, similarly indicate the ending of that quotation within a quotation.

2:23	a136		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῦτον	1	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Jesus. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.)

2:23	i6un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῇ, ὡρισμένῃ βουλῇ καὶ προγνώσει τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἔκδοτον	1	The term translated **given up** is an adjective, not a passive verbal form, but even so you may wish to translate it with an active verbal form. Alternate translation: “whom God gave up by his determined counsel and foreknowledge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:23	s38b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ, ὡρισμένῃ βουλῇ καὶ προγνώσει τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **counsel** and **foreknowledge**, you could express the same ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “as God had planned in a determined way for things he knew about ahead of time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

2:23	a138		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀνόμων	1	Peter is using the adjective **lawless** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could supply the word “people” to show this. Alternate translation: “lawless people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:23	f6kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀνόμων	1	By **lawless**, Peter does not mean people who disregard the law and break the law. He is describing Gentiles (that is, people who are not Jews) by association with the fact that they do not have the Jewish law. Alternate translation: “of the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

2:24	a140			ὃν ὁ Θεὸς ἀνέστησεν	1	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “But God raised him up”
2:24	ei37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὃν ὁ Θεὸς ἀνέστησεν	1	The idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died.

2:24	s8j3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λύσας τὰς ὠδῖνας τοῦ θανάτου	1	Peter speaks of the **agonies of death** as if they were ropes with which Jesus had been tied, and of God bringing Jesus back to life as if God had untied those ropes and set him free.

2:24	a141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰς ὠδῖνας τοῦ θανάτου	1	Peter uses the possessive form to describe **death** as something that is characterized by **agonies.** Alternate translation: “agonizing death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:24	a142		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθότι οὐκ ἦν δυνατὸν κρατεῖσθαι αὐτὸν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why this was **not possible**.

(Peter is quoting from [Psalm 16:8–11](../psa/16/08.md).) Alternate translation: “For David said about him that he saw the Lord before him through all, for he was at his right so that he should not be moved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:25	a143		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Δαυεὶδ γὰρ λέγει εἰς αὐτόν, προορώμην τὸν Κύριον ἐνώπιόν μου διὰ παντός, ὅτι ἐκ δεξιῶν μού ἐστιν, ἵνα μὴ σαλευθῶ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to the Messiah, about whom David is prophesying. This means that within the quotation, the pronouns **I** and **my** are spoken by the Messiah. If you turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation and change these pronouns to “he,” “him,” and “his,” it may be helpful to indicate the references in some cases so that your readers will recognize this. Alternate translation: “For David said about the Messiah that he saw the Lord before him through all, for the Lord was at the Messiah’s right so that he should not be moved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:25	a144		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Peter uses the word **For** to introduce a reason why the crowd should believe him when he says that God brought Jesus back to life. The reason is that the Scriptures predicted this. As a result, the crowd should be confident that it did happen. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You can be confident that God did bring Jesus back to life, because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:25	a145		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Δαυεὶδ & λέγει εἰς αὐτόν	1	Peter assumes that the crowd will know that he is referring to what **David says** in one of the psalms that he wrote, and that David is prophesying what the Messiah would say.

2:25	n2ls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιόν μου	1	The phrase **before me**, which means “in front of me,” is a spatial metaphor. Alternate translation: “present with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:25	tqak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	διὰ παντός	1	The phrase **through all** is an ellipsis for “through all times.” It means “always.” Alternate translation: “at all times” or “always” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:25	a146		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκ δεξιῶν μού	1	Here the adjective **right** is being used as a noun to indicate the right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

2:25	l6xp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκ δεξιῶν μού	1	In this context, to be at someone’s right side means to be in a position to help and sustain that person. Alternate translation: “there to help me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:25	a147		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ σαλευθῶ	1	Here, **moved** means to be taken out of a safe and secure position, and so it means to be harmed. Alternate translation: “I will not be harmed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:25	s4yp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ σαλευθῶ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “no one will harm me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:26	a148		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	διὰ τοῦτο ηὐφράνθη ἡ καρδία μου, καὶ ἠγαλλιάσατο ἡ γλῶσσά μου; ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἡ σάρξ μου κατασκηνώσει ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation of David into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “Because of this, his heart was glad and his tongue exulted, and indeed his flesh would also dwell in hope” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:26	z8vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ηὐφράνθη ἡ καρδία μου	1	Here, the **heart** represents the emotions. Alternate translation: “I felt glad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

2:26	a151		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	καὶ ἡ σάρξ μου κατασκηνώσει ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι	1	The Messiah is speaking as if his body itself would live hopefully. Alternate translation: “I will also have hope for my body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
2:26	a152		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἡ σάρξ μου κατασκηνώσει ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what **hope** the Messiah had for his body. Alternate translation: “I will also have hope that God will bring my body back to life after I die” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:27	m3ij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι οὐκ ἐνκαταλείψεις τὴν ψυχήν μου εἰς ᾍδην, οὐδὲ δώσεις τὸν Ὅσιόν σου ἰδεῖν διαφθοράν	1	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from David into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation.

Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it may be helpful to show that to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **nor** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “you will not abandon my soul to Hades, no, you will not allow your Holy One to see decay” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
2:27	whi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	οὐκ ἐνκαταλείψεις & οὐδὲ δώσεις & σου	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular, and they refer to God. See what you decided to do in your translation in [1:24](../01/24.md) in a similar case where God is addressed as “you.” You may have decided in such cases to use a formal form of “you” that your language may have, or you may have decided to use an informal form of “you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
2:27	a154		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οὐκ ἐνκαταλείψεις τὴν ψυχήν μου εἰς ᾍδην	1	The Messiah says **my soul** to mean himself, using one part of his being to represent his whole being. Alternate translation: “you will not abandon me to Hades” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:27	a156		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Ὅσιόν σου	1	The expression **Holy One** is a title for the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

2:27	l5cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰδεῖν διαφθοράν	1	The term **decay** refers in this context to the decomposition of the body after death.

If so, it may be helpful to add some introductory material here. Alternate translation: “The Messiah said that God had made known to him the paths of life and that God would fill him with gladness with his face” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:28	a159		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	ἐγνώρισάς & πληρώσεις & σου	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular and they refer to God. See what you decided to do in the similar case in [1:24](../01/24.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
2:28	xhi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγνώρισάς μοι ὁδοὺς ζωῆς	1	The Messiah speaks of **life** as if it consisted of **paths** that a person walked along.

2:28	ej5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πληρώσεις με εὐφροσύνης	1	The Messiah speaks as if he were a container that God could **fill** with **gladness**. Alternate translation: “you will give me great gladness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:28	y7gf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μετὰ τοῦ προσώπου σου	1	Here, the word **face** represents the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “by your presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:28	a161		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	μετὰ τοῦ προσώπου σου	1	This is the end of Peter’s quotation of David. If you chose to mark David’s words as a second-level quotation, in your translation you can indicate this ending with a closing second-level quotation mark or whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:29	pv1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

2:29	wh97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ πατριάρχου Δαυεὶδ	1	A **patriarch** is literally the ancestor of a group of people.

2:29	vtc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐτάφη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “people buried him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

2:30	a164		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προφήτης & ὑπάρχων, καὶ εἰδὼς	1	Peter is still speaking about David. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because David was a prophet and he knew” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:30	x11q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ καρποῦ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ, καθίσαι ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ	1	Peter is using the word **loins** to represent David himself by association with the way the reproductive organs are in the loins. He is using the word **fruit** in a broad sense to mean what someone or something produces, in this case a descendant. Alternate translation: “to set one of his descendants upon his throne” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:30	hq71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐκ καρποῦ τῆς ὀσφύος αὐτοῦ, καθίσαι ἐπὶ τὸν θρόνον αὐτοῦ	1	When Peter says that God promised to **set** one of David’s descendants **upon his throne**, he is using that one action to represent God’s promise to David that this descendant would succeed him as king.

2:31	a166		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐλάλησεν περὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “he described how God would make Christ alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:31	tn4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὔτε ἐνκατελείφθη εἰς ᾍδην	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

2:31	a167		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	**Christ** is the Greek word for “Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use the term “Messiah” in your translation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

2:32	udn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνέστησεν ὁ Θεός	1	As in [2:24](../02/24.md), the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “God has brought back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:32	kw6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	By **we**, Peter means himself and the other apostles, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:33	a171		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce a result. But it is not the immediate result of what he has just said. He is not saying that Jesus has done what the people see and hear because God raised him from the dead. Instead, this is an overall conclusion. Peter is saying that Jesus sending the Holy Spirit is the reason why the disciples are able to speak in other languages. The crowd should not conclude that they are babbling drunkenly, as some of them have suggested. UST models a way of expressing this sense of the word **Therefore**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

2:33	a172		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ δεξιᾷ & τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor.

2:33	a173		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τήν τε ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ Πνεύματος τοῦ Ἁγίου	1	Peter is using the possessive form to describe the Holy Spirit as someone whom God the Father promised to send.

Peter means that Jesus has given these things generously and abundantly. See how you translated the similar statement in [2:17](../02/17.md), to which Peter is likely alluding here. Alternate translation: “he has generously given” or “he has abundantly given” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:34	m7fy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγει & αὐτός, εἶπεν Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	The material in [2:34–35](../02/34.md) contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting another psalm by David ([Psalm 110:1](../psa/110/01.md)), and David is quoting God. You could avoid having second-level and third-level quotations by translating this as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “he himself says that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
2:34	i8wu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶπεν Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	**The Lord** means God here, and **my Lord** means the Messiah.

2:35	nf1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	The psalm says that God would make the Messiah’s **enemies** a **stool** for his **feet** to mean that God would conquer those enemies and make them submit to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:35	a176		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	This is the end of David’s quotation of the Lord and of Peter’s quotation of David. If you chose to mark these in your translation as a third-level and a second-level quotation, indicate that ending here with the appropriate closing quotation marks or the comparable punctuation or convention in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:36	a177		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce the result of what he has just said.

2:36	msqt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	γινωσκέτω πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language.

2:36	tgbf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	γινωσκέτω πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ	1	It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative, since to this point in his speech Peter has been addressing his audience in the second person. Alternate translation: “all you in the house of Israel, know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2:36	pnp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Israel** means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the entire nation of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:37	s85q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀκούσαντες & κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “what they heard Peter say pierced their heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:37	xan1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	Here the word **they** refers to the people in the crowd to whom Peter spoke. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in the heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:37	w1ma			κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in their hearts”
2:37	l15x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	Luke is speaking. The people were not literally **pierced in the heart** by anything. He means that the people felt guilty and became very sad. Alternate translation: “they felt guilty and became very sad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:37	zls6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “Our brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:37	a178		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “Our fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:37	a179		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	τί ποιήσωμεν	1	The people in the crowd are asking about themselves but not the apostles, so use the exclusive form of **we** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:38	a180		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	μετανοήσατε & βαπτισθήτω ἕκαστος ὑμῶν & τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν & λήμψεσθε	1	The words **you** and **your** are plural, **you will receive** is a plural verb form, and the implied “you” in the imperative **Repent** is also plural. But the implied “you” in the imperative **be baptized** is singular, since the subject is **each**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
2:38	cmb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βαπτισθήτω	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “allow us to baptize you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:38	geb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here the **name** of Jesus represents his authority. By being baptized, these believers were acknowledging Jesus’ authority over their lives as their Lord and Savior. Alternate translation: “to express your allegiance to Jesus Christ as your Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:38	a181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **forgiveness**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “forgive.” Alternate translation: “to show that you want God to forgive your sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:39	a182		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐστιν ἡ ἐπαγγελία	1	Peter is speaking of the Holy Spirit by association with the way God promised to send the Holy Spirit, as Peter says specifically in [2:33](../02/33.md). Alternate translation: “God has promised the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:39	a183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμῖν & καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν	1	Peter showed the people in [2:17](../02/17.md) that God’s promise through Joel to pour out his Spirit included their “sons” and “daughters.” So the implication could be that the people in the crowd should not think that any of them have to reach a certain age before professing faith in Jesus and being baptized. Alternate translation: “to all of you, no matter what your age,” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:39	a184		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμῖν & καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν	1	Peter could also be using the word **children** in a figurative sense to mean “descendants.” In that case, he would be saying that faith in Jesus as the Messiah was not something just for the people living at this time, but also for people living at all times in the future. That would parallel what he says next about faith in Jesus not being just for those who are present in this place, but for people living in all places. Alternate translation: “to you and your descendants” or “to you and everyone who will live after you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:39	v8vi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πᾶσι τοῖς εἰς μακρὰν	1	Since Peter is speaking to Jews as a fellow Jew, this is likely an implicit reference to the Jews who were living in other parts of the Roman Empire. However, this statement took on greater meaning when the church realized that “God has also given repentance unto life to the Gentiles,” as its leaders say in [11:18](../11/18.md). So you could either express the likely initial meaning here in your translation, or you could leave the statement more general. Alternate translation: “to the Jews living in faraway parts of the empire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:39	a185		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	By **the Lord our God**, Peter means the God of the Jews. He is speaking of himself and his fellow apostles and of the people in the crowd, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:39	a186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἂν προσκαλέσηται	1	Peter is using the word **call** in an idiomatic sense here. Alternate translation: “may bring to salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:40	a187		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἑτέροις & λόγοις πλείοσιν	1	Luke is using the term **words** to mean things that Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “by saying many other things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:40	v6ip		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	διεμαρτύρατο, καὶ παρεκάλει αὐτοὺς	1	Here Luke is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **urged** tells in what way Peter **testified** further about faith in Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this same idea with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “he testified urgently to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
2:40	a188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σώθητε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “Let God save you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:40	wtd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς τῆς σκολιᾶς ταύτης	1	The implication is that God is going to punish **this perverse generation**. Alternate translation: “from the punishment that this perverse generation will suffer if it does not repent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:40	a189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς γενεᾶς τῆς σκολιᾶς ταύτης	1	The word **perverse** describes things or actions that do not conform to what is right and expected. Peter may be referring implicitly to how the people of this **generation** rejected and killed Jesus. Alternate translation: “this wicked generation that rejected and killed Jesus” or “the wicked people of this time who rejected and killed Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:41	k1kj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	οὖν	1	Luke uses the word **Therefore** to introduce information about what happened after the story of Pentecost as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
2:41	r9qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀποδεξάμενοι τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **received** means that the people in the crowd accepted that what Peter said was true. Alternate translation: “because they believed his word” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:41	a190		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean what Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “what Peter said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:41	kz64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ & ἐβαπτίσθησαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. The apostles themselves may have baptized all these people, but because so many people repented and wanted to be baptized, it is possible that some of the other believers may have baptized some of them. Alternate translation: “the apostles baptized them” or “the believers baptized them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:41	sv5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ψυχαὶ	1	Luke is using one part of these people, their **souls**, to mean the people themselves. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:41	a47f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	προσετέθησαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “became part of the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:42	a191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἦσαν & προσκαρτεροῦντες τῇ διδαχῇ τῶν ἀποστόλων, καὶ τῇ κοινωνίᾳ, τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου, καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **teaching** and **fellowship**, you could express the same ideas with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “they continued to learn from what the apostles taught and to share life with one another, and to break bread together and to pray together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:42	gc59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου	1	Luke could be using the word **breaking** to mean “eating,” and he could be using the word **bread** to mean “food.” In each case he would be using one part of something to mean the whole thing. Breaking bread is one thing people do when they eat it, and bread is one kind of food. So this could be a reference to the believers sharing meals together. Alternate translation: “in sharing meals” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:42	a192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου	1	By **the breaking of bread**, Luke could also mean remembering the death of Jesus in the way that Jesus commanded, by literally breaking a loaf of bread and sharing it and also sharing a cup of wine. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in observing the Lord’s Supper” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:43	a193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐγίνετο & πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Alternate translation: “every soul began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
2:43	gi9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐγίνετο & πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	Luke is using one part of a person, the **soul**, to mean the entire person. Alternate translation: “every person began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:43	a194		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐγίνετο & πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	Luke says **every** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “very many people began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:43	ys3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πολλά & τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα διὰ τῶν ἀποστόλων ἐγίνετο	1	Since Luke says that these things happened **through the apostles**, the implication is that God was doing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make God the subject of this sentence and **wonders and signs** the object. Alternate translation: “God performed many wonders and signs through the apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:43	q6dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πολλά & τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα	1	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:22](../02/22.md). Alternate translation: “many great miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:44	u8qk			ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “united in Christian fellowship”
2:44	jy2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	εἶχον ἅπαντα κοινά	1	Luke may be saying **all** as a generalization to emphasize the powerful spirit of generosity among the believers. The next verse explains more specifically how the believers showed this generosity, and you could give some indication of that here. Alternate translation: “shared their belongings with one another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:45	h8tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τὰ κτήματα καὶ τὰς ὑπάρξεις ἐπίπρασκον	1	The words **properties** and **possessions** mean similar things. Luke may be using these words together for emphasis. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They were selling many valuable things that they owned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:45	f74s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ διεμέριζον αὐτὰ	1	Here the pronoun **they** refers to believers who sold things they owned, and the pronoun **them** refers to the money they received from these sales. Alternate translation: “the believers who sold these things were distributing the money that they received” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:45	n9hi			πᾶσιν, καθότι ἄν τις χρείαν εἶχεν	1	Alternate translation: “to everyone who needed help”
2:46	in43			καθ’ ἡμέραν τε προσκαρτεροῦντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Continuing to meet with one accord” or “Continuing to meet harmoniously”
2:46	a427		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when Luke says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:46	q1ge		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	κλῶντές & κατ’ οἶκον ἄρτον	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:42](../02/42.md). There were two possible meanings there, but here **breaking bread** seems to mean specifically sharing meals. Alternate translation: “having meals together in their homes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:46	i2yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει καὶ ἀφελότητι καρδίας	1	Here, the **heart** represents the emotions. Alternate translation: “with feelings of exultation and sincerity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:46	a195		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει καὶ ἀφελότητι καρδίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **exultation** and **sincerity**, you could express the same ideas with adverbs that would indicate feelings. Alternate translation: “joyfully and sincerely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:47	z6ig		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	αἰνοῦντες τὸν Θεὸν καὶ ἔχοντες χάριν πρὸς ὅλον τὸν λαόν	1	Luke says **the whole people** as a generalization to emphasize how widely the people favored the believers. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They praised God and enjoyed wide favor with the people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:47	kc42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοὺς σῳζομένους	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “those whom he was saving” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:47	a196			ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “to their Christian fellowship”
3:intro	hpd9				0	# Acts 3 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The covenant God made with Abraham\n\nThis chapter explains that Jesus came to the Jews in fulfillment of the covenant that God made with Abraham.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Servant”\n\nTwice in this chapter Peter uses the word “Servant” as a title to mean “Messiah” (3:13, 3:26). He and other believers use the word in the same sense twice in Chapter 4 as well (4:27, 4:30). The word takes on this meaning by allusion to the book of Isaiah, where Isaiah uses it to mean the person whom God has chosen for the special purpose of bringing salvation. In your translation, indicate in some way that “Servant” is a Messianic title. Jesus was not a servant of God in the more ordinary sense, in which the believers apply it to themselves in 4:29, for example. Jesus was fully the Son of God, sent to earth on a special mission. If you would not be able to make this clear by using the word “Servant,” you may wish to use the word “Messiah” instead.\n\n### “You killed” (3:15)\n\nFor the same reasons as when he was speaking on the day of Pentecost (2:23), Peter tells people in this chapter that they were guilty of killing Jesus. But he also tells them that they are the first ones to whom God has sent Jesus’ followers to invite them to repent (3:26). For further information and suggestions for how to make clear in your translation what Peter means, see the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to Chapter 2 and the notes to this phrase in 2:23 and 3:15. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])
3:1	b5rm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next.

3:1	br7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when Luke says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “to the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:1	a198			τὴν ἐνάτην	1	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this time in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “three o’clock in the afternoon”
3:1	a199		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τὴν ἐνάτην	1	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “hour nine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
3:2	f227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καί τις ἀνὴρ, χωλὸς ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ ὑπάρχων, ἐβαστάζετο, ὃν ἐτίθουν καθ’ ἡμέραν πρὸς τὴν θύραν τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form instead of the passive form **was being carried**. Alternate translation: “And there was a certain man who had been lame since birth whom people would carry to the temple every day and place at the gate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:2	u6nu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καί τις ἀνὴρ	1	In this verse, Luke provides background information about this man to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

3:2	a202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ ἱερόν	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when Luke says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple.

3:4	xq4u			ἀτενίσας & Πέτρος εἰς αὐτὸν σὺν τῷ Ἰωάννῃ εἶπεν	1	This means that both Peter and John looked at the man. It does not mean that Peter looked at the man and at John, and it does not mean that both Peter and John spoke to the man. Alternate translation: “Peter and John looked intently at him, and Peter said”
3:4	e3c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	βλέψον εἰς ἡμᾶς	1	Peter is asking the man to look at him and John, not to look at himself as well, so use the exclusive form of **us** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:6	x6bm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον	1	Peter is referring to money by association with the way that **silver** and **gold** were used for money at this time. Alternate translation: “money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:6	zi9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ δὲ ἔχω, τοῦτό σοι δίδωμι	1	What happens next in the story shows that by **what I have**, Peter implicitly means the authority that Jesus has given him to heal.

3:6	a205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	περιπάτει	1	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, it was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I give you the ability to walk” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
3:7	ec6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πιάσας αὐτὸν τῆς δεξιᾶς χειρὸς, ἤγειρεν αὐτόν; παραχρῆμα δὲ ἐστερεώθησαν αἱ βάσεις αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ σφυδρά	1	In this verse, the pronoun **he** refers to Peter, while the pronouns **him** and **his** refer to the lame man. You could indicate that specifically in at least some of the cases if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “seizing the man by the right hand, Peter raised him up, and immediately the man’s feet and ankles were made strong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:7	a206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐστερεώθησαν αἱ βάσεις αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ σφυδρά	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “his feet and ankles became strong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

3:8	q13i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἔστη καὶ περιεπάτει, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν σὺν αὐτοῖς	1	Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that this man had been doing something else (sitting at the gate begging) but then began to do something new when was healed. It might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it may seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express in your language. Alternate translation: “he stood and walked” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
3:8	zp7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when Luke says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:9	a208		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶς ὁ λαὸς	1	The word **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the crowd that was in the courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:10	zy7h			ἐπεγίνωσκον & αὐτὸν, ὅτι αὐτὸς ἦν ὁ & καθήμενος	1	Alternate translation: “they realized that he was the man who had been sitting”
3:10	p2zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῇ Ὡραίᾳ Πύλῃ	1	This was the name of one of the entrances to the temple area. See how you translated the similar expression in [3:2](../03/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:10	a209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπλήσθησαν θάμβους καὶ ἐκστάσεως ἐπὶ τῷ συμβεβηκότι αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “what had happened to him filled them with wonder and amazement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:10	j6zf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐπλήσθησαν θάμβους καὶ ἐκστάσεως ἐπὶ τῷ συμβεβηκότι αὐτῷ	1	The words **wonder** and **amazement** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. You can combine the words in your translation if that might be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “what had happened to him filled them with complete amazement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:10	a210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθησαν θάμβους καὶ ἐκστάσεως ἐπὶ τῷ συμβεβηκότι αὐτῷ	1	Luke is speaking as if the people were containers that these responses could fill. Alternate translation: “what had happened to him made them completely amazed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:10	a211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπλήσθησαν θάμβους καὶ ἐκστάσεως ἐπὶ τῷ συμβεβηκότι αὐτῷ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wonder** and **amazement**, you could express the same idea with verbs. Alternate translation: “they wondered and marveled greatly at what had happened to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:11	a212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶς ὁ λαὸς	1	The word **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the crowd that was there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:11	rk1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῇ στοᾷ τῇ καλουμένῃ Σολομῶντος	1	This is the name of a covered walkway in the Jerusalem temple courtyard. It consisted of rows of pillars that supported a roof. People had named this porch after King Solomon. Alternate translation: “Solomon’s Porch” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:11	rj43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῇ καλουμένῃ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that people call” or “whose name is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:12	ndi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰσραηλεῖται	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:12	uyg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί θαυμάζετε ἐπὶ τούτῳ	1	Peter does not expect the crowd to tell him why they are marveling. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you should not marvel at this!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:12	j6ld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ ἡμῖν τί ἀτενίζετε, ὡς ἰδίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ εὐσεβείᾳ πεποιηκόσιν τοῦ περιπατεῖν αὐτόν?	1	Peter is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Do not stare at us. We did not make him walk by our own power or godliness!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:12	g4y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν & ἰδίᾳ	1	By **us** and **our own**, Peter means himself and John but not also the people in the crowd. So use the exclusive forms of **us** and **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:12	mwd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἰδίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ εὐσεβείᾳ	1	Peter may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **or.** The term **godliness** describes what the crowd may consider the source or nature of the **power** that he and John have. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “by our own godly power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
3:13	q8q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ & Ἰσαὰκ & Ἰακώβ	1	These are the names of three men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:13	a213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	Peter is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “of our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:13	kmqw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	The term **fathers** could mean: (1) in a generic sense that includes both men and women, the ancestors of the Israelites. If you decide to retain this metaphor in your translation, you could state “fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (2) Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In that case, Peter would be repeating the meaning of the previous phrase, and the term would have a masculine meaning. Alternate translation: “of the patriarchs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:13	a214			τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, Ἰησοῦν	1	See the discussion of the term **Servant** in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “Jesus his Messiah”
3:13	a215			παρεδώκατε	1	Alternate translation: “handed over for trial”
3:13	cp1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ πρόσωπον Πειλάτου	1	Here the phrase **before the face of** means “in the presence of.” Alternate translation: “in the presence of Pilate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:13	yy96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	κρίναντος ἐκείνου ἀπολύειν	1	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **that** as a noun to refer to a certain person, Pilate. (ULT adds **one** to indicate that.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could indicate specifically whom Peter means. Alternate translation: “when Pilate had decided to release him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
3:14	a217		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Peter uses this word to introduce a contrast between what Pilate wanted to do and what these people demanded he do instead. Alternate translation: “Even though Pilate wanted to release Jesus,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:14	a218		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸν Ἅγιον καὶ Δίκαιον	1	Peter is using both the adjective **Holy** and the adjective **Righteous** to indicate a certain person, Jesus. (ULT adds **One** to indicate that.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could indicate specifically whom Peter means. Alternate translation: “Jesus, who was holy and righteous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
3:14	a219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τὸν Ἅγιον καὶ Δίκαιον	1	The terms **Holy** and **Righteous** mean similar things. Peter is using the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the Supremely Holy One” or “Jesus, who was supremely holy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:14	a220		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Ἅγιον καὶ Δίκαιον	1	This description of Jesus is an implicit assertion that he is the Messiah. Alternate translation: “Jesus, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:14	s6qj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ᾐτήσασθε ἄνδρα, φονέα χαρισθῆναι ὑμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “asked Pilate to release to you a man who was a murderer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:15	a221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀπεκτείνατε	1	It was the Romans who literally killed Jesus, but Peter says that the Jewish people in the crowd killed him because their demands led to his death. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “you demanded the death of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
3:15	ljn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν & Ἀρχηγὸν τῆς ζωῆς	1	Peter is using the expression **the Originator of Life** as another title for Jesus. This expression could be a reference to the way Jesus, as the Son of God, took part in the original creation of all life. It could also be a reference to the way Jesus gives spiritual life to all who believe in him. Or it could mean both things. In any event, Peter is drawing a contrast between the life-giving Jesus whom the people rejected and the life-taking murderer whom they asked Pilate to release. It may be best in your translation to bring out this contrast while leaving the specific meaning open. Alternate translation: “Jesus, who gives life rather than taking it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:15	a222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
3:15	jwb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	Peter is speaking at least of himself and John, and perhaps also of the other apostles, but not of the people he is addressing. So use the exclusive form of **we** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **we** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “we and the other apostles whom Jesus chose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:15	a223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἡμεῖς	1	If you conclude that Peter is referring only to himself and John, and if your language uses dual forms, use the dual form of the pronoun **we** here, since it would apply to two people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:16	abc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ, τοῦτον ὃν θεωρεῖτε καὶ οἴδατε, ἐστερέωσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	Your language might naturally present the phrases in this sentence in a different order. Alternate translation: “this man whom you see and know had faith in his name, and his name has made him strong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:16	qt8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ & τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Jesus in both of these instances. Alternate translation: “in the name of Jesus … that name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:16	a224		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ & τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	Peter is using the **name** of Jesus to mean his authority or power. Alternate translation: “in the authority of Jesus … the authority of Jesus” or “in the power of Jesus … the power of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:16	abc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἡ πίστις ἡ δι’ αὐτοῦ, ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ	1	The first instance of the pronoun **him** refers to Jesus, and the second instance refers to the man who had been lame. Alternate translation: “the faith that is through Jesus has given to this man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:16	a225		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ πίστις ἡ δι’ αὐτοῦ, ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ τὴν ὁλοκληρίαν ταύτην	1	Peter is speaking of **faith** as if it were a living thing that could have given **complete health** to the man. Alternate translation: “because this man had faith in Jesus, Jesus has given him this complete health” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:17	v45t			καὶ νῦν	1	Peter uses the expression **And now** to shift the people’s attention away from the lame man so that he can speak to them directly. In your translation, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that would be natural for this same purpose.
3:17	a226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	Peter addresses the people as his **brothers** because they are related to him as fellow descendants of the founders of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “my kinsmen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:17	x62k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατὰ ἄγνοιαν ἐπράξατε	1	Peter likely means that the people **acted in ignorance** of the fact that Jesus was the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you acted in ignorance of the fact that Jesus was the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:17	a228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ὑμῶν	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and that your rulers also acted in ignorance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:18	gcc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ὁ δὲ Θεὸς ἃ προκατήγγειλεν διὰ στόματος πάντων τῶν προφητῶν, παθεῖν τὸν Χριστὸν αὐτοῦ, ἐπλήρωσεν οὕτως	1	Your language might naturally put first in this sentence the information that God **fulfilled** prophecies when Christ suffered. Alternate translation: “But in this way God has fulfilled what he foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:18	ms6d			διὰ στόματος πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	Since Peter is speaking of a group of people, **the prophets**, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “through the mouths of all the prophets”
3:18	z3l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ στόματος πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	Peter is using the **mouth** of the prophets to represent what they said by using their mouths. Alternate translation: “through what all the prophets said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:18	a229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	Peter is using the word **all** as a generalization. It is true that the overall witness of Old Testament prophecy is that the Messiah would come first in humility and suffering, but not every prophet spoke specifically of the sufferings of Christ. Alternate translation: “of many prophets” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:19	cw18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψατε	1	Peter is speaking of his listeners as if they were traveling somewhere and had taken the wrong way and needed to **turn back** onto the right way. Alternate translation: “start obeying the Lord again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:19	zm6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πρὸς τὸ ἐξαλειφθῆναι ὑμῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “so that God will wipe away your sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:19	a230		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸς τὸ ἐξαλειφθῆναι ὑμῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας	1	Peter is speaking of sins as if they would be physically **wiped away** when God forgave them. Alternate translation: “so that God will forgive your sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:20	a231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὅπως ἂν ἔλθωσιν καιροὶ ἀναψύξεως ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Peter is speaking of these **times** as if they could actively **come** to his listeners on their own. Alternate translation: “so that the Lord may send you times of refreshing from his face” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:20	x3ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καιροὶ ἀναψύξεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **refreshment**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “refreshing” or “restful.” Alternate translation: “refreshing times” or “restful times” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:20	f2wm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Peter is using the term **face** to represent the presence of the Lord. Alternate translation: “from the presence of the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:20	h3nk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποστείλῃ	1	Peter is referring implicitly to Christ’s coming again. Alternate translation: “he may again send” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:20	yzr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν προκεχειρισμένον ὑμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the one whom he has appointed for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:21	vgn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὃν δεῖ οὐρανὸν μὲν δέξασθαι	1	Peter is speaking of **heaven** as if it were a person who has welcomed Jesus into his home. Alternate translation: “who must remain in heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:21	x2f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἄχρι χρόνων ἀποκαταστάσεως πάντων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **restoration**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “restore.” Alternate translation: “until the times when God will restore all things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:21	a2m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπ’ αἰῶνος	1	The expression **from the age** means that something happened a long time ago. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “long ago” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:21	a12i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ στόματος τῶν ἁγίων & αὐτοῦ προφητῶν	1	Peter is using the **mouth** of the prophets to represent what they said by using their mouths. Alternate translation: “through what his holy prophets said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:22	a232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Μωϋσῆς μὲν εἶπεν, ὅτι προφήτην ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐμέ αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε κατὰ πάντα, ὅσα ἂν λαλήσῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Moses indeed said that the Lord our God would raise up a prophet like himself for us Israelites from among our brothers. Moses said that we were to listen to him according to everything—whatever he might speak to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:22	a249		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	Some ancient manuscripts read “the Lord our God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 somewhat loosely but with the same basic meaning. ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “the Lord your God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 exactly. Still other ancient manuscripts read simply “the Lord God.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
3:22	a250		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	Moses is speaking of himself and his fellow Israelites, whom he is addressing, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:22	v5nf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει	1	Here the expression **raise up** does not mean “bring back to life,” as it did in [2:24](../02/24.md) and [2:32](../02/32.md). In this context, it refers instead to God giving someone the mission to go as a prophet to certain people with a message for them. Alternate translation: “will send to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:22	t8di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν	1	Moses is using the term **brothers** to mean people who are fellow descendants with his listeners of the founders of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “your kinsmen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:22	a234		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε κατὰ πάντα	1	Moses is using a future statement to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must listen to everything he tells you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
3:22	a235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε κατὰ πάντα	1	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “You must obey every command that he gives you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:23	a236		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἔσται δὲ πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Moses also said that every soul that did not listen to that prophet would be destroyed from the people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:23	t8a5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will destroy from the people every soul that does not listen to that prophet” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:23	a237		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	Moses could be using a future statement to give a command, in which case he would be telling the people to take this action. Alternate translation: “you must destroy from the people every soul that does not listen to that prophet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
3:23	a238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις	1	Moses is using one part of a person, the **soul**, to mean the entire person. Alternate translation: “every person who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
3:23	a239		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου	1	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “does not obey that prophet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:24	u6x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες & οἱ προφῆται	1	Here the phrase **all the prophets** is probably not the same kind of generalization that it seems to be in [3:18](../03/18.md). It is true in a more literal sense that all the prophets **announced these days**. There was something in the messages of each one of them that pointed to the culmination of God’s work in the coming of Jesus. So even if your language does not use generalizations for emphasis, you could translate these words just as Peter says them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:24	xp9h			ἀπὸ Σαμουὴλ καὶ τῶν καθεξῆς	1	Alternate translation: “beginning with Samuel and continuing with those who lived after he did”
3:24	m9pr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας	1	Peter is using the word **days** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “this time” or “these times” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:24	a241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας	1	Peter is referring to a specific time to mean implicitly what is happening at that time. Alternate translation: “the things that are happening now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:25	rh2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑμεῖς ἐστε οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν	1	Peter is using the word **sons** in the sense of “heirs,” by association with the way that children inherit from their parents. He means that the Israelites living at this time are going to receive something as a legacy from those who lived before them. Alternate translation: “You are the ones who are going to receive what the prophets promised” or “You are the ones who are going to experience what the prophets foretold” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:25	a242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ υἱοὶ	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “the sons and daughters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:25	a243		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καὶ τῆς διαθήκης ἧς διέθετο ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1	The figurative sense of **sons** as “heirs” continues in this phrase. Alternate translation: “and who are going to receive what God promised to your fathers when he made a covenant with them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:25	a244		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν, λέγων πρὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου ἐνευλογηθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “with your fathers when he said to Abraham that in his seed all the families of the earth would be blessed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:25	a245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1	Here, **fathers** means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “your ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:25	wid4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1	Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “your fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:25	mad5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου	1	The term **seed** means “offspring.” It is a word picture. Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. Alternate translation: “through your descendants” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:25	a246		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου	1	As the apostle Paul notes in [Galatians 3:16](../gal/03/16.md), God used the singular form of the word **seed** when he said this to Abraham, and so the ultimate fulfillment of this promise came when God sent Jesus as the Savior for everyone in the world who would believe in him. That may also be what Peter has in view here, since he refers in the next verse to God’s “Servant,” meaning the Messiah. Alternate translation: “through the Messiah, who will be your descendant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:25	a247		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνευλογηθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I will bless all the families of the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:25	g31m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	Here, **families** refers to people groups or nations by association with the way that many of them consist of people who have a common ancestry. Alternate translation: “all the nations of the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:26	b7tz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστήσας ὁ Θεὸς τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν	1	The expression **raised up** has the same meaning here as in [3:22](../03/22.md). See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “When God appointed Jesus as the Messiah, he sent him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:26	z5q6			τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ	1	See the discussion of the term **Servant** in the General Notes to this chapter, and see how you translated that term in [3:13](../03/13.md). Alternate translation: “his Messiah”
3:26	x8ss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ ἀποστρέφειν ἕκαστον ἀπὸ τῶν πονηριῶν ὑμῶν	1	Here, **turning** someone **from** something means leading that person to stop doing that thing. See how you translated the similar expression in [3:19](../03/19.md). Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to repent of your wickedness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:26	a248		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῷ ἀποστρέφειν ἕκαστον ἀπὸ τῶν πονηριῶν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wickedness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wicked.” Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to stop doing wicked things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:intro	pv3a				0	# Acts 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set lines of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 4:25–26.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Unity\n\nThe first Christians wanted very much to be united. They wanted to believe the same things and share everything they owned and help those who needed help.\n\n### “Signs and wonders”\n\nThis phrase refers to things that only God can do. The Christians wanted God to do what only he could do so that people would believe that what they said about Jesus was true.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The “head of the corner” or cornerstone (4:11)\n\nThe cornerstone was the first piece of stone that people put down when they were building a building out of stone. Peter refers to it as the “head of the corner” in 4:11. This is a metaphor for the most important part of something, the part on which everything else depends. To say that Jesus is the cornerstone of the church is to say that nothing in the church is more important than Jesus and that everything in the church depends on Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “no other name” (4:12)\n\n“There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). As a note to this verse explains, in this expression the term “name” represents a person. So with these words, Peter was saying that no other person who has ever been on the earth or who will ever be on earth can save people. This statement might cause some controversy in some places today, but it is an essential part of the Christian message, and it should be translated so that its meaning is clear.
4:1	abc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λαλούντων & αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. Alternate translation: “as Peter and John were speaking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:1	ew3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ στρατηγὸς τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	The temple had its own guards, and this man was their commanding officer. Alternate translation: “the commander of the temple guard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:1	m74s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	The Sadducees would have been particularly upset that Peter and John were saying that God raised Jesus from the dead, because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “the Sadducees, who do not believe in the resurrection,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:1	d3tv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	Luke is using the name of the whole group to mean some of its members. Alternate translation: “some of the Sadducees” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:2	abc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	διαπονούμενοι διὰ τὸ διδάσκειν αὐτοὺς	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These men were greatly troubled because Peter and John were teaching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:2	mg5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καταγγέλλειν ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ τὴν ἀνάστασιν, τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent phrase. Peter and John were saying that God would raise people from the dead in the same way that he had raised Jesus. Translate this in a way that allows **the resurrection** to refer to both Jesus’ resurrection and the general resurrection of other people. Alternate translation: “proclaiming that God makes people alive again who have died, just as God had done for Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:2	np5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
4:3	a254		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce what the men who came up to Peter and John did because they were so troubled by their teaching. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:3	a255		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees. The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees laid hands on Peter and John” or “the men who had come up to Peter and John laid hands on them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:3	zla7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας	1	The expression **laid hands on** means to arrest someone by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:3	a256		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔθεντο εἰς τήρησιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **custody**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “imprison.” Alternate translation: “they imprisoned them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:3	h5f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἦν γὰρ ἑσπέρα ἤδη	1	The implication is that the ruling council, which Luke describes in [4:5–6](../04/05.md), would not meet to question anyone at night. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “since it was already evening and the council would not meet to question them at night” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:4	a257		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce information about what happened after this much of the story as a result of the events within the story itself. This is not the end of the whole story, but it is the end of a significant part of it. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
4:4	a258		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that Peter and John shared by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:4	bm1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀριθμὸς τῶν ἀνδρῶν	1	Luke is not using the word **men** in a generic sense here. The figure of 5,000 is the number of the men alone. It does not include women and children. So it would not be accurate to translate **men** as “people.” Instead, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this distinction explicitly. Alternate translation: “the number of the men alone, not counting the women and children,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:4	qd8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγενήθη & ὡς χιλιάδες πέντε	1	The word translated **became** could mean: (1) the community of believers in Jesus grew to a total of 5,000 as a result of the professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “in the community of believers grew to about 5,000” (2) “was,” and that would indicate that 5,000 men made professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “who put their faith in Jesus that day was about 5,000” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	lw2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
4:5	cdj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συναχθῆναι αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	Luke is implicitly describing the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which consisted of these three groups of people. Luke describes this council explicitly as “the Sanhedrin” in [4:15](../04/15.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could identify it by name here. Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, consisting of their rulers and elders and scribes, was gathered together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	j6p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	The pronoun **their** refers to the Jewish people. Alternate translation: “the rulers and elders and scribes of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:5	i9tj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συναχθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “gathered together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:6	a259		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἅννας ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς, καὶ Καϊάφας	1	Luke describes Annas as **the high priest**, but the actual situation was complicated. At this time the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea. One Roman official had appointed Annas some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son-in-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’ claim to the position. If you decide to clarify this for your readers, it would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible. Alternate translation: “Annas, whom the Jews recognized as the high priest, and Caiaphas, whom a Roman official had appointed as the high priest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:6	l44n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἅννας & Καϊάφας & Ἰωάννης & Ἀλέξανδρος	1	These are the names of four men. The **John** mentioned here was a member of the high priest’s family. This is not the same John as the apostle. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:6	a260			ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐκ γένους ἀρχιερατικοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “all the other members of the high priestly family who were members of the council”
4:7	abc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	στήσαντες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ μέσῳ, ἐπυνθάνοντο	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronouns **their** and **they** refer to the council members. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “when the council members had set Peter and John in their midst, the members asked them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:7	t1eq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν ποίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ ἐν ποίῳ ὀνόματι ἐποιήσατε τοῦτο ὑμεῖς?	1	The words **power** and **name** (meaning authority; see next note) mean similar things. The council members may be using them together to ask a comprehensive or emphatic question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “By whatever means were you able to do this?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:7	jc21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ποίῳ ὀνόματι	1	Here, **name** refers to authority. Alternate translation: “by what authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:7	a261		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ὑμεῖς	1	Since the council members are speaking to two men, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. (All other pronouns in this account that refer to Peter and John would also be dual, such as **them** in its two instances in this verse.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
4:8	su5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Πέτρος πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, εἶπεν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. See how you translated the comparable expression in [2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled Peter and he said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:8	a262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Πέτρος πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, εἶπεν	1	Luke is speaking of Peter as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit inspired Peter and he said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:8	a263		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ πρεσβύτεροι	1	Peter is addressing the entire council by referring to its two components. Some of the members had ruling responsibilities. Others, the **elders**, were added to the council to bring its total membership up to 70, since according to [Exodus 24:1](../exo/24/01.md), that was the number of elders who accompanied Moses when God confirmed the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai. Alternate translation: “You members of the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
4:8	a264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ λαοῦ	1	Here, **the people** means specifically the people of Israel. Alternate translation: “of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:9	pq85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	εἰ ἡμεῖς σήμερον ἀνακρινόμεθα ἐπὶ εὐεργεσίᾳ ἀνθρώπου ἀσθενοῦς, ἐν τίνι οὗτος σέσωσται	1	Peter is not suggesting seriously that the subject of the questioning is uncertain. He knows the subject, but he is suggesting ironically that it is uncertain so that he can describe it from his own perspective. The council asked by what power or authority he and John did “this,” implying that “this” was something bad, a public disturbance that troubled the authorities. In response, Peter asserts that “this” was instead something good, **a good deed to a sick man**. If it would be helpful to your readers, in your translation you could indicate the meaning that Peter is communicating through this irony. Alternate translation: “what we actually did was a good deed for a sick man, and if you want to know by what means he was made well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
4:9	je6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡμεῖς & ἀνακρινόμεθα	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you are questioning us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:9	b92n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὗτος σέσωσται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he became healthy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:10	q9ss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	γνωστὸν ἔστω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may this be known to you and to all the people of Israel” or “this should be known to you and to all the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
4:10	snd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γνωστὸν ἔστω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ	1	The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject. Alternate translation: “you and all the people of Israel, know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:10	j3px		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πᾶσιν ὑμῖν	1	The pronoun **you** refers to the council members. Alternate translation: “to all of you council members” or “to all of you who are questioning us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:10	khn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι	1	Here, **name** refers to power and authority. Alternate translation: “through the power” or “by the authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:10	a265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ Ναζωραίου	1	See how you translated this in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [3:6](../03/06.md). Alternate translation: “of Jesus Christ of Nazareth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:10	a266		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὃν ὑμεῖς ἐσταυρώσατε	1	It was the Romans who literally crucified Jesus, but Peter says that these Jewish leaders crucified him because their demands led to his death. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be crucified” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:10	jyj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὃν ὁ Θεὸς ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	As in [2:24](../02/24.md), the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “whom God made alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:10	a267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
4:11	nwg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτός	1	The pronoun **He** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:11	w195		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ λίθος ὁ ἐξουθενηθεὶς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, τῶν οἰκοδόμων, ὁ γενόμενος εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	Peter is quoting from [Psalm 118:22](../psa/118/22.md), and the quotation contains a metaphor. This psalm is describing the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, we recommend that you translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:11	c1bh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ ἐξουθενηθεὶς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, τῶν οἰκοδόμων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that you, the builders, rejected” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:11	f1nx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:12	a268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἡ σωτηρία	1	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “there is no salvation in no one else.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “he is the only one in whom there is salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
4:12	tq3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἡ σωτηρία	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **salvation**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “he is the only one who is able to save” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:12	l66w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲ & ὄνομά ἐστιν ἕτερον ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν τὸ δεδομένον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God has not given any other name under heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:12	iz7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐδὲ & ὄνομά ἐστιν ἕτερον & ἐν ᾧ δεῖ σωθῆναι ἡμᾶς	1	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “there is no other person … by whom we must be saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:12	jm25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in [2:5](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: “on earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:12	a269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “among people” or “to people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:12	gg8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ δεῖ σωθῆναι ἡμᾶς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that can save us” or, if you translate “name” as “person,” “who can save us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:12	tdw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	Peter is using the word **we** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:13	r6d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	θεωροῦντες	1	Luke is using the word **seeing** to mean that the council members noticed this and found it significant. Alternate translation: “taking note of” or “impressed with” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:13	t6kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν τοῦ Πέτρου παρρησίαν καὶ Ἰωάννου	1	Here the abstract noun **boldness** refers to the way in which Peter and John responded to the Jewish leaders. If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the same idea with an adverb or an adjective. Alternate translation: “how boldly Peter and John had spoken” or “how bold Peter and John were” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:13	qaa5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καταλαβόμενοι	1	The implication is that the Jewish leaders realized this because of the way Peter and John spoke. Alternate translation: “realizing from the way they spoke” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:13	xn39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐθαύμαζον; ἐπεγίνωσκόν τε αὐτοὺς, ὅτι σὺν τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἦσαν	1	Here the pronoun **they** refers in its first two instances to the council members, and in its third instance it refers to Peter and John, as does the pronoun **them**. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this and to state the meaning here more concisely. Alternate translation: “the council members marveled, and they recognized that Peter and John had been with Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:13	erv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἄνθρωποι ἀγράμματοί εἰσιν καὶ ἰδιῶται	1	The words **uneducated** and **ordinary** mean similar things. Both words indicate that Peter and John had no formal education. Luke uses them together for emphasis, to express from the council members’ perspective how amazed they were. Alternate translation: “they had no formal education at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:14	h3cy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τόν & ἄνθρωπον & τὸν τεθεραπευμένον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the man whom Peter and John had healed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:14	a270		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	σὺν αὐτοῖς ἑστῶτα, τὸν τεθεραπευμένον, οὐδὲν εἶχον	1	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “standing with Peter and John, the council members had nothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:14	fq4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδὲν εἶχον ἀντειπεῖν	1	The implication is that anything the council members said **in opposition** would have been in an attempt to discredit the claim that the man had been healed in the name of Jesus. But there was nothing they could say, since the evidence that the claim was true was right in front of them in the person of the formerly lame man standing on his own. Alternate translation: “they had nothing to say to discredit the account” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:15	ql31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	κελεύσαντες & αὐτοὺς ἔξω τοῦ Συνεδρίου ἀπελθεῖν, συνέβαλλον πρὸς ἀλλήλους	1	The pronoun **them** refers at least to Peter and John, and probably also to the man who was healed, while the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “having commanded Peter and John and the man who was healed to go outside the Sanhedrin, the council members conferred among themselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:15	a272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ Συνεδρίου	1	Luke is using the name of the Jewish ruling council to mean the meeting place of that council. Alternate translation: “the place where the Sanhedrin met” or “the council chamber” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:16	p4g6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ποιήσωμεν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις?	1	This could mean: (1) the Jewish leaders were using the question form to express their frustration because they realize that they cannot punish Peter and John. As [4:21](../04/21.md) indicates explicitly, and as the leaders suggest here, they are afraid of how the people might respond if they do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “It is very difficult to know what we should do to these men!” (2) the leaders were asking one another a genuine question, because ultimately they do decide to do something to Peter and John. They warn them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus, with an implied threat of punishment if they do. In that case it would be accurate to translate this as a question. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:16	jn12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσιν τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλὴμ	1	This is a generalization that the leaders are making to emphasize how widely the news of the healing has spread. Alternate translation: “people who live throughout Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
4:16	nh5s			γνωστὸν σημεῖον	1	Here the word **sign** has the same sense that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [2:43](../02/43.md). It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “a remarkable miracle”
4:17	a273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλεῖον διανεμηθῇ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “so that it does not spread” or “so that they will not spread it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:17	f71l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλεῖον διανεμηθῇ	1	By **it**, the council members do not mean the news of the man’s healing, since they have already said that everyone in Jerusalem knows about it. They mean the teaching that Jesus is Messiah, since they then try to prevent this from spreading by not allowing the apostles to speak to anyone about Jesus. Alternate translation: “so that this teaching about Jesus does not spread” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:17	a274			ἐπὶ πλεῖον	1	Alternate translation: “any further”
4:17	w52j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ	1	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “to speak about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:17	a275		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μηκέτι λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “no longer to speak in this name to none of men.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “to stop speaking in this name to any of men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
4:17	a276		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	Here, **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “to any person” or “to anyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:18	a277		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the council members did as a result of their discussion. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:18	a278		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καλέσαντες αὐτοὺς, παρήγγειλαν	1	The pronoun **them** refers in both instances to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “summoning Peter and John, the council members commanded them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:18	a279		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	μὴ φθέγγεσθαι μηδὲ διδάσκειν	1	The words **speak** and **teach** mean similar things. The council members may be using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “not to say anything publicly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:18	a280		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:19	a281		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ & Πέτρος καὶ Ἰωάννης ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Peter and John responded to the council. Alternate translation: “Peter and John responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
4:19	a282		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & Πέτρος καὶ Ἰωάννης ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον	1	This could mean: (1) Peter and John each said different parts of the quotation in [4:19–20](../04/19.md). (2) Peter spoke these words on behalf of both of them, since the Holy Spirit had inspired him to speak to the council in [4:8–12](../04/08.md). Alternate translation: “Peter responded on their behalf” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:19	jf1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰ δίκαιόν ἐστιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here the phrase **before God** refers to God’s opinion by association with the way that God would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “Whether God thinks it is right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:19	a283		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑμῶν ἀκούειν μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “to obey you rather than God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:20	a284		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Peter and John are using the word **For** to introduce the reason why the council needs to judge whether it would be right for them to obey the council rather than God. Alternate translation: “The reason why you must judge whom we should obey is that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:20	hf3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & εἴδαμεν καὶ ἠκούσαμεν	1	Peter and John are using the word **we** to refer to themselves but not to their listeners, so use the exclusive form of the word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:20	a285		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ δυνάμεθα & ἡμεῖς & μὴ λαλεῖν	1	You could state the meaning of this double negative positively. Alternate translation: “we must speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
4:21	y5y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ δὲ προσαπειλησάμενοι ἀπέλυσαν αὐτούς	1	The pronoun **them** refers in both instances to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “having warned Peter and John further, the council members released them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:21	z2bx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τὸν λαόν	1	The implication is that the Jewish leaders were afraid that the people would riot if they punished Peter and John. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They were afraid that if they did punish Peter and John, the people would riot” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:21	jbl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες ἐδόξαζον τὸν Θεὸν	1	Here, **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “large numbers of them were glorifying God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
4:22	gy8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἐτῶν γὰρ ἦν πλειόνων τεσσεράκοντα ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἐφ’ ὃν γεγόνει τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως	1	In this verse, Luke provides background information about the age of the man who was healed to help readers understand why the people considered his healing such a remarkable miracle. In your translation, present this background information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
4:22	a286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Luke is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why the people were glorifying God. Alternate translation: “The people were glorifying God because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:22	ju4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἐφ’ ὃν γεγόνει τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως	1	Luke is speaking as if the **healing** had **happened** on its own. Alternate translation: “the man whom Peter and John had miraculously healed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
4:22	a287		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως	1	Luke is using the possessive form to describe a **sign** that consisted of a **healing**. The word **sign** has the same sense here that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [2:43](../02/43.md). It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “this miraculous healing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:23	a288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπολυθέντες	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “after the council members had released Peter and John” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:23	a289		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθον πρὸς τοὺς ἰδίους	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “they went to their own people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
4:23	j2cx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς ἰδίους	1	The phrase **their own people** refers to the community of believers in Jesus. Alternate translation: “the other believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:23	a290		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι	1	As Peter does in [4:8](../04/08.md), here Luke is referring to the entire council by naming its two components. Alternate translation: “the members of the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
4:24	j3ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ & ἀκούσαντες & ἦραν	1	The phrase **having heard** refers to the other believers, but the pronoun **they** seems to include Peter and John as well, since those who pray ask for boldness to keep speaking the message about Jesus ([4:29](../04/29.md)). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “when the other believers heard this report, together with Peter and John they raised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:24	a291			ἦραν φωνὴν	1	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **voice**. Alternate translation: “they raised their voices”
4:24	zu28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἦραν φωνὴν	1	The expression **they raised their voice** is an idiom that means they spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “they prayed loudly” or “they prayed out loud” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:24	a292			ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “with one accord” or “harmoniously”
4:24	a293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	σὺ	1	The word **you** is singular, and it refers to God. The same is true of the words “you” and “your” in [4:25–30](../04/25.md). You may have decided to use a formal form of “you” in your translation in such cases. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
4:24	a160		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	The believers are referring to all of creation by naming its components. Alternate translation: “who created everything that exists” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
4:24	a294			τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	The believers are using the word translated **heaven** in one of its specific senses to mean the sky. Alternate translation: “the sky”
4:25	ka83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου στόματος Δαυεὶδ παιδός σου εἰπών	1	The word **mouth** refers to what David said by using his mouth. Alternate translation: “the one whose Holy Spirit inspired our father David, your servant, to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:25	vc5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου στόματος Δαυεὶδ παιδός σου εἰπών, ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά?	1	As the believers pray together, they quote from one of the psalms that David composed, [Psalm 2:1–2](../psa/02/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “whose Holy Spirit inspired our father David, your servant, to ask why the nations raged and why the peoples imagined useless things.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:25	a295		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	The believers are using the word **our** to refer to themselves but not to God, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:25	kat6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ πατρὸς	1	Here, **father** means “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “ancestor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:25	a296			παιδός	1	The believers are using the word **servant** here in its ordinary sense, not as a title for the Messiah, so it would not be appropriate to translate it as “Messiah,” as you may have done when it was a title in [3:13](../03/13.md) and [3:26](../03/26.md).
4:25	a297		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά	1	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “Why did the nations rage, and why did the peoples imagine useless things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:25	a298		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Why did the nations rage, indeed, why did the peoples imagine useless things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
4:25	f1x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά?	1	In this psalm, David uses the question form to emphasize the futility of opposing God. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The nations should not have raged, and the peoples should not have imagined useless things!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:25	w622		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κενά	1	The phrase **useless things** implicitly describes plans to oppose God, which can never succeed. Alternate translation: “ways to oppose God, which always prove useless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:26	fb5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ κατὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	This is the rest of the quotation from Psalm 2 that the believers started in [4:25](../04/25.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David said that the kings of the earth had taken their stand and the rulers had gathered to the same against the Lord and against his Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:26	w2by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	In keeping with the conventions of Hebrew poetry, these two phrases mean basically the same thing. If the repetition might be confusing for your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth took their stand, yes, the rulers were gathered to the same” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
4:26	w64b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς	1	The expression **took their stand** describes an army lining up for battle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth lined up their troops for battle” or “The kings of the earth formed their battle lines” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:26	a299		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the rulers gathered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:26	a300			ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Here it could mean “by agreement” or “in the same place.” You could use either phrase as an alternate translation.
4:26	yv19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Κυρίου & τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Here the word **Lord** refers to God and the word **Christ** refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “God the Lord … his Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:27	b1g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνήχθησαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “gathered together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:27	nuc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ	1	The phrase **this city** refers to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “here in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:27	ca33			παῖδά	1	Here the word **Servant** is a title for the Messiah. See the discussion of that term in the General Notes to Chapter 3, and see how you translated it in [3:13](../03/13.md) and [3:26](../03/26.md). Alternate translation: “Messiah”
4:27	a303		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὃν ἔχρισας	1	In the Old Testament, ceremonial oil was poured on a person who was being given the authority to assume an office or to do a special task. The believers are speaking of anointing to indicate that God appointed Jesus to be the Messiah. Alternate translation: “whom you appointed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:28	yz7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ σου προώρισεν γενέσθαι	1	Here, **hand** means God’s power and **counsel** means God’s plan. Alternate translation: “all that your power and your plan had predetermined to happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:28	a304		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ σου προώρισεν γενέσθαι	1	The words **hand** and **counsel**, joined by **and**, are expressing a single idea. The word **hand**, meaning “power,” tells by what means God intended to carry out his **counsel**, that is, his plan. Alternate translation: “all that you planned in advance to make happen by your power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
4:28	a305		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ σου προώρισεν γενέσθαι	1	The believers are speaking of God’s **hand** and his **counsel** (that is, his power and his plan) as if they had **predetermined** what would happen to Jesus.

4:29	b38z			καὶ τὰ νῦν	1	The believers use the expression **And now** to direct God’s attention to the request they are making in light of what they have said to this point in their prayer. In your translation, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this same purpose.
4:29	t5qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἔπιδε ἐπὶ τὰς ἀπειλὰς αὐτῶν	1	The phrase **look upon** is an idiomatic way of asking God to pay attention to the threats that the Jewish leaders have made against the believers. Alternate translation: “pay attention to the threats they have made” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:29	a306		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τοῖς δούλοις σου	1	The believers are speaking of themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person in your translation. Alternate translation: “to us, your servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
4:29	zh7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον σου	1	The believers are using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that God has told them to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:29	a307		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ παρρησίας πάσης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **boldness**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “boldly.” The word **all** is an intensifier. Alternate translation: “very boldly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:30	x9r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ τὴν χεῖρά σου, ἐκτείνειν σε εἰς ἴασιν, καὶ σημεῖα, καὶ τέρατα, γίνεσθαι	1	Here the **hand** represents God’s power. To **stretch out** the hand means to use it. So this is a prayer for God to do powerful things. Alternate translation: “as you do powerful things to heal people and to make signs and wonders happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:30	a308		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σημεῖα, καὶ τέρατα	1	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis.

4:31	a309		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	καὶ	1	This verse is the end of the whole story of how the lame man was healed and how Peter and John were arrested as a result. Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after the story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
4:31	a310		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ ἦσαν συνηγμένοι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “where they had gathered together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

4:31	a313		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ παρρησίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **boldness**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “boldly.” Alternate translation: “boldly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:32	a314		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information in [4:32–37](../04/32.md) that will help readers understand further episodes in the story. These verses introduce Barnabas, who will be an important character in the book, and they also help account for what happens to Ananias and Sapphira in the next chapter. You can translate the word **Now** with a term or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
4:32	xu3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἦν καρδία καὶ ψυχὴ μία	1	Here the word **heart** seems to represent the emotions and the word **soul** seems to represent the desires. Alternate translation: “thought the same way and desired the same things” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:32	a315		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἦν καρδία καὶ ψυχὴ μία	1	The terms **heart** and **soul** mean similar things, and Luke may be using them together for emphasis. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “was genuinely united” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:32	a316			τῶν ὑπαρχόντων αὐτῷ	1	Alternate translation: “of the things that he owned”
4:32	zyp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἦν αὐτοῖς πάντα κοινά	1	The word **everything** may be a generalization that emphasizes the powerful spirit of generosity among the believers. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:44](../02/44.md). Alternate translation: “they shared their belongings with one another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
4:33	a317		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἀναστάσεως τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “of how God made the Lord Jesus alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:33	a318		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	χάρις τε μεγάλη ἦν ἐπὶ πάντας αὐτούς	1	The pronoun **them** refers back to “the multitude of those who believed” in [4:32](../04/32.md). It does not refer just to the **apostles**, who are mentioned in this verse. Alternate translation: “great grace was upon all of the believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:33	d8dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις τε μεγάλη ἦν ἐπὶ πάντας αὐτούς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **grace**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent expression. The word could describe: (1) how God was blessing the believers. Alternate translation: “God was blessing all of the believers in wonderful ways” (2) how the people in Jerusalem held the believers in high esteem. Alternate translation: “the people of Jerusalem thought very highly of all the believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:34	a331		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐνδεής τις ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	This statement expresses the result of the rest of what Luke says in this verse and what he says in the next verse. If it would be helpful in your language to put this result after the reasons for it, you could create a verse bridge by moving this statement to the end of the next verse and beginning it with the word “So” instead of **For**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
4:34	a319		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Luke uses the word **For** in its first instance in this verse to introduce the evidence or reason for his statement at the end of the previous verse that “great grace was upon them all.” The meaning here depends on the meaning there.

4:34	a320		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	2	Luke uses the word **for** in its second instance in this verse to introduce the reason why no one in the community of believers was needy.

4:34	gw3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὅσοι γὰρ κτήτορες χωρίων ἢ οἰκιῶν ὑπῆρχον	1	The phrase **as many as** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “many believers who owned lands or houses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

4:35	a321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐτίθουν παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων	1	The expression **laying it at the feet** indicates that believers who sold possessions were putting the money they received onto the ground in front of the apostles. In this culture, that was a symbolic way of presenting it to them as a gift to be used to help others in the community. If there is a comparable symbolic action in your culture, you could use that in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “they were presenting it to the apostles” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction)
4:35	vv4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐτίθουν παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων	1	In this culture, putting the money on the ground in front of the apostles was a symbolic way of presenting it to them as a gift to be used to help others in the community.

4:36	uc2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Ἰωσὴφ δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
4:36	a323		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ & Βαρναβᾶς	1	**Joseph** and **Barnabas** are two names for the same man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

4:36	a326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον, υἱὸς παρακλήσεως	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that he is saying what the name Barnabas means when **translated** from the Aramaic language. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “which means Son of Encouragement in Aramaic” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:36	nr4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	υἱὸς παρακλήσεως	1	The expression **Son of** describes a person who shares the qualities of something. The apostles used this name to describe Joseph’s behavior and character, since he was a person who encouraged others.

4:36	a327		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	υἱὸς παρακλήσεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **Encouragement**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “encourage.” Alternate translation: “the One who Encourages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

5:intro	k2uh				0	# Acts 5 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit?” (5:3)\n\nNo one knows for sure whether Ananias and Sapphira were truly Christians when they decided to lie about the land that they sold (5:1–10), because Luke does not say. However, Peter knew that they lied to the believers, and he knew that they had listened to and obeyed Satan. When they lied to the believers, they also lied to the Holy Spirit. This is because the Holy Spirit lives inside believers.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Long sentences\n\nActs 5:36 consists of a single long sentence. ULT represents all of it as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\nThere is also a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 5:38 to nearly the end of 5:39. In this case as well it may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.
5:1	v27a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀνὴρ δέ τις	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
5:1	ysl9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἁνανίας	1	**Ananias** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
5:1	a332		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	σὺν Σαπφείρῃ τῇ γυναικὶ αὐτοῦ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce another new character into the story.

5:2	a334		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐνοσφίσατο ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς	1	The implication, as the story later makes clear, is that Ananias did not tell anyone except his wife that he was keeping some of the money for himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, and you could state why he did this. Alternate translation: “he kept some of the money from the sale for himself, but he did not admit that he was doing that, because he wanted everyone to think he was being completely generous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:2	xm1t			συνειδυίης καὶ τῆς γυναικός, καὶ ἐνέγκας μέρος τι & ἔθηκεν	1	It may be helpful to make two new sentences here, particularly if you add information to the previous phrase as suggested in the preceding note. Alternate translation: “His wife also knew that he was keeping back part of the sale money. He brought a certain portion of the money and laid it”
5:2	dy8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων ἔθηκεν	1	This means that he presented to money to the apostles.

5:3	grr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	διὰ τί ἐπλήρωσεν ὁ Σατανᾶς τὴν καρδίαν σου, ψεύσασθαί σε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, καὶ νοσφίσασθαι ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς τοῦ χωρίου?	1	Peter is using the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you should not have let Satan fill your heart so that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back from the price of the land!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:3	pqd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διὰ τί ἐπλήρωσεν ὁ Σατανᾶς τὴν καρδίαν σου	1	Peter is speaking of the **heart** of Ananias as if it were a container that Satan had **filled**. Alternate translation: “why have you allowed Satan to influence your heart so strongly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:3	a335		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν καρδίαν σου	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “your thoughts and motives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “for you to keep back from the price of the land and lie to the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
5:3	zz5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ψεύσασθαί σε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	Ananias did not lie literally to the Holy Spirit, but he did lie to the apostles and to all of the believers who would have learned about his gift, and the Holy Spirit was present in them. So by lying to them, he was effectively also lying to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, who is present in us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:3	a336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ νοσφίσασθαι ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς	1	The implication of what Peter says here is that Ananias claimed or pretended that he was giving the entire amount that he had received from selling his land. Alternate translation: “by pretending that you were giving us the entire amount when you had kept back some for yourself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:4	vu7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ μένον σοὶ ἔμενεν, καὶ πραθὲν ἐν τῇ σῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ὑπῆρχεν?	1	Peter continues to use the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “While it remained, it remained yours, and after it was sold, it was still in your authority.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:4	vi8w			ἔμενεν	1	Alternate translation: “While it remained unsold” or “Before you sold it”
5:4	k7nc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πραθὲν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “once you had sold it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	a337		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ σῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ὑπῆρχεν	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the money that Ananias received from the sale of the land. Alternate translation, as a statement: “you could still do whatever you wanted with the money you received” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:4	a338		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ σῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ὑπῆρχεν	1	The implications are that Ananias was not obligated to give all of the money to the apostles. He was free to keep some if he wished or if he needed it. He could simply have acknowledged that he was doing that, and giving the rest of the money would still have been a generous act because there was no compulsion. Alternate translation, as a statement: “you could have kept some and acknowledged that and you would have still been making a generous gift” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:4	i5dw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι ἔθου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο?	1	Peter continues to use the question form to rebuke Ananias.

Alternate translation: “You should not have placed this thing in your heart!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

5:4	a340		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τί ὅτι ἔθου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο?	1	Peter speaks of **this thing**, that is, the plan to keep back some of the money, as if Ananias had **placed** it in his **heart**, meaning his thoughts. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “You should not even have thought of doing such a thing!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	a341		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐψεύσω ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Ananaias actually has **lied to men**, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of his act. As in the previous verse, where Peter says that Ananias has lied to the Holy Spirit, here he means that Ananias has lied to the apostles and other believers, and God is present in them. So by lying to them, he has effectively also lied to God. Alternate translation: “You have not lied merely to men, but also to God, who is present in us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:4	a342		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “human beings.” Alternate translation: “to human beings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

5:5	cc5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	πεσὼν ἐξέψυξεν	1	The word translated **expired** means that Ananias “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that he died. Alternate translation: “fell down and died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
5:5	a344		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	πεσὼν ἐξέψυξεν	1	Ananias fell down because he died. He did not die because he fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that he died and then that he fell. Alternate translation: “died and fell to the ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
5:5	a345		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐγένετο φόβος μέγας ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀκούοντας	1	Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Alternate translation: “everyone who heard about it came to feel a very deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
5:6	a346		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστάντες δὲ, οἱ νεώτεροι συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν	1	Here the expression **rising up** means that the young men took an action that they recognized they needed to take. It does not mean that they stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “the young men took action and wrapped him up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:6	a347		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ νεώτεροι	1	This could refer to: (1) some strong young men who were present who realized that burying Ananias was a task they could help with. Alternate translation: “some strong young men who were present” (2) a group of young men among the believers who regularly helped the apostles with tasks that required physical strength. Alternate translation: “the young men who regularly helped the apostles with physical tasks” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:6	a348		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν	1	It was the custom in this culture to wrap linen cloths around the bodies of people who had died, in order to prepare the bodies for burial. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could describe it more specifically, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “wrapped a linen burial cloth around his body” or “prepared his body for burial” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
5:7	a349		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ὡρῶν τριῶν διάστημα, καὶ	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time passing. Your language may have its own way of describing that. Alternate translation: “After about three hours had gone by,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:7	ry54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Ananias. Alternate translation: “the wife of Ananias” or “Sapphira” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:7	k3c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ γεγονὸς	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “that Peter had exposed their lie and that her husband was dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:8	a350			ἀπεκρίθη & πρὸς αὐτὴν	1	The word translated **said** means to continue or resume a conversation. Alternate translation: “asked her, based on what her husband had said”
5:8	a351		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ἀπέδοσθε	1	Since Peter is speaking of two people, Ananaias and Sapphira, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
5:8	bcf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοσούτου & ναί, τοσούτου	1	This refers to the amount of money that Ananias had given to the apostles. Peter may be naming the amount or, as UST suggests, he may be showing Sapphira the money. Alternate translation: “for this amount of money … yes, for that amount of money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:9	v7sw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου?	1	Peter is using the question form to rebuke Sapphira. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:9	hc22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you agreed together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:9	w1lb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν & σου & σε	1	The word **you** in its first instance refers to two people, Ananias and Sapphira, so it would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. The word **your** and the word **you** in its second instance refer only to Sapphira, so those words are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
5:9	pg1e			πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	Here the word **test** means to challenge. Ananias and Sapphira were trying to see if they could get away with lying about how much they received for the land they sold. Alternate translation: “to challenge the Spirit of the Lord”
5:9	a352		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	Ananias and Sapphira actually tested or challenged the apostles, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of their act, as he does similarly in [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:4](../05/04.md). Since the Spirit of the Lord was present in the apostles, by challenging them, Ananias and Sapphira effectively lied to the Spirit. Alternate translation: “to test the Spirit of the Lord, who is present in us apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:9	a353		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, οἱ πόδες	1	Peter says **Behold** to get Sapphira to focus her attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “And now the feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:9	xj1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ πόδες τῶν θαψάντων τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἐπὶ τῇ θύρᾳ	1	Peter is referring to the return of the young men who buried Ananaias. Their **feet** represent them by association with the way they are using their feet to walk back. The **door** represents their return by association with the way they will come through the door when they return. Alternate translation: “the young men who buried your husband are just now returning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:9	a354		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ πόδες τῶν θαψάντων τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἐπὶ τῇ θύρᾳ	1	Peter is telling Sapphira implicitly that her husband died as a judgment from God when Peter confronted him with the lie about the price of the land. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your husband died as a judgment from God when I confronted him with the lie you both told about the price of the land, and the young men who buried him are just now returning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:9	a355		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἐξοίσουσίν σε	1	The implications are that Sapphira is also going to die and that the same young men will **carry** her **out** to bury her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are also going to die as a judgment from God, and those same young men are going to carry you out and bury you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:10	s7en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ἔπεσεν & πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέψυξεν	1	The word translated **expired** means that Sapphira “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that she died. Alternate translation: “she fell down at his feet and died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
5:10	a356		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ἔπεσεν & πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέψυξεν	1	Sapphira fell down because she died. She did not die because she fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that she died and then that she fell. Alternate translation: “she died and fell down at his feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
5:10	nwb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔπεσεν & πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ	1	This means that she fell to the ground in front of Peter. This expression should not be confused with the idea of “falling down at a person’s feet,” that is, bowing down to the ground in front of someone as a sign of humility. Alternate translation: “she collapsed onto the ground in front of him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:10	a357		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ νεανίσκοι	1	See how you translated this expression in [5:6](../05/06.md). However, it may not be necessary to explain again here who these **young men** were in terms of their role in the community. Instead, you could identify them by their role in the story. Alternate translation: “the same young men who had buried Ananias” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:11	vym8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	καὶ	1	This verse is the end of the story about Ananias and Sapphira. Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after the story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
5:11	a358		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐγένετο φόβος μέγας ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀκούοντας ταῦτα	1	Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. See how you translated the similar expression in [5:5](../05/05.md). Alternate translation: “the whole church and everyone who heard about these things came to feel a very deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
5:12	c2e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce background information in [5:12–16](../05/12.md) that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. You can translate this word with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
5:12	sri8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ & τῶν χειρῶν τῶν ἀποστόλων, ἐγίνετο σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα πολλὰ	1	Luke is using the **hands** of the apostles to represent their actions. Alternate translation: “the apostles were doing many signs and wonders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:12	ux3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα	1	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated this expression in [4:30](../04/30.md). Alternate translation: “great miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:12	aud2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἦσαν & πάντες	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the whole community of believers. Alternate translation: “the whole community of believers was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:12	a359			ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “meeting together with one accord” or “meeting together harmoniously”
5:12	k99k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῇ Στοᾷ Σολομῶντος	1	This was a covered walkway that consisted of rows of pillars that supported a roof. It was named after King Solomon. See how you translated the phrase “the porch that is called Solomon’s” in [3:11](../03/11.md), which is a description of this same walkway. Alternate translation: “Solomon’s Porch” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
5:13	a360		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν & λοιπῶν, οὐδεὶς	1	The expression **the others** refers to people who were not believers in Jesus. Alternate translation: “none of the people who were not believers in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:13	a361		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐτόλμα κολλᾶσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why no unbelievers **dared to join them**. The reason seems to be that the Jewish leaders had commanded the apostles not to speak or teach about Jesus ([4:18](../04/18.md)), but they were still doing that. Later in this chapter, in [5:28](../05/28.md), the Sanhedrin indicates that it has arrested the apostles for violating that command. Alternate translation: “would meet with them, because the apostles were still preaching about Jesus even though the Jewish leaders had commanded them not to do so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:14	a362		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	προσετίθεντο & τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	Luke says **the Lord** to mean the community of people who believed in the Lord. Alternate translation: “were being added to the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:14	m9wx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	προσετίθεντο & τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:41](../02/41.md). Alternate translation: “were becoming part of the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:14	oxni		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	Luke is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Use a form for addressing someone respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: “about the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
5:15	a364		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Luke says **so that** to introduce a result, but it is not the direct result of what he said just before, that many men and women became part of the church. It is the result of what he said in [5:12](../05/12.md), that the apostles were doing “many signs and wonders.” All of [5:12–15](../05/12.md) could be understood as a single sentence, and in that case what Luke says here would more clearly follow logically and grammatically from what he says in [5:12](../05/12.md). However, ULT divides the material into several sentences, which is another way in which it can be understood. UST models a way to show how what Luke says here introduces a result of what he said in [5:12](../05/12.md) about the “signs and wonders” that the apostles were doing. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:15	l9bs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐκφέρειν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people who lived in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “people who lived in Jerusalem … carried” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:15	a365		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς	1	Luke is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who were sick” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:15	a366		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κλιναρίων καὶ κραβάττων	1	The words **cots** and **mats** mean similar things. Luke could be using them together for emphasis, although he could also be describing two different ways that people managed to make their sick relatives and friends reasonably comfortable as they waited in the streets for Peter to walk by. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “improvised beds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:15	y2ev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν	1	The implication is that God was healing sick people whom Peter’s shadow touched. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “his shadow might overshadow any one of them and God would heal that person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:15	a367			ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν	1	Luke is using a construction in which the subject and verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have its own way of describing this. Alternate translation: “his shadow might fall on”
5:16	a368		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀσθενεῖς	1	See how you translated the expression **the sick** in [5:15](../05/15.md). Alternate translation: “people who were sick” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:16	fu1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὀχλουμένους ὑπὸ πνευμάτων ἀκαθάρτων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “those whom unclean spirits were afflicting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:16	lyc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἵτινες ἐθεραπεύοντο ἅπαντες	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “and the apostles healed them all” or “and God used the apostles to heal them all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:16	a369		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οἵτινες ἐθεραπεύοντο ἅπαντες	1	It does not appear that **all** is a generalization for emphasis in this case. So it would not be accurate to treat **all** as figurative and say something like “and large numbers of them were healed.” Luke is describing what remarkable things God did through the apostles at this time, and he does seem to mean that every sick person whom the people brought to Jerusalem was healed. So it would be appropriate to say in your translation just what ULT says here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
5:17	x2ed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce a strong contrast into the story. Your language may have its own way of introducing a contrasting narrative. You could also refer back to the previous action in order to highlight the contrast. Alternate translation: “But even though the apostles were doing so much good,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:17	f9ye		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ἀναστὰς & ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων, ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου,	1	The high priest and these Sadducees were first **filled with jealousy** and then they rose up (took action) against the apostles. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy and they rose up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
5:17	pc45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναστὰς & ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων, ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου,	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form instead of the passive form **were filled**. Alternate translation: “jealousy filled the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) and they rose up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:17	a370		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς	1	Here the expression **rising up** means that the high priest decided to take action, not that he stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “taking action” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:17	a371		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	The phrase **all those with him** means specifically all the other priests who joined the high priest in taking action against the apostles. Luke observes here that those other priests were from the group known as the **Sadducees**. As a note to [4:1](../04/01.md) explains, they opposed the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and all of the priests from the group known as the Sadducees who wanted to oppose the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:17	a372		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **jealousy**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “jealous.” Alternate translation: “became very jealous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:17	a373		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου	1	Luke is speaking as if the high priest and his allies were containers that jealousy **filled**. Alternate translation: “became very jealous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:18	j58p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστόλους	1	The expression **laid hands on** means to arrest someone by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested the apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:18	a374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστόλους	1	The high priest and his allies did not arrest the apostles personally. They would have ordered the temple guards to arrest them. But Luke speaks as if the high priest and his allies did this action because they had a significant part in it by ordering it. Alternate translation: “they had the temple guards arrest the apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
5:19	wd37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐξαγαγών & αὐτοὺς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “bringing the apostles out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:20	qm16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when the angel says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:20	z1x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τῆς ζωῆς ταύτης	1	The angel is using the term **words** to mean the message that the apostles were to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the entire message about this life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:20	a375			τῆς ζωῆς ταύτης	1	Alternate translation: “about the everlasting life that God gives through Jesus” or “about the new way of living that people can have as followers of Jesus”
5:21	a376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀκούσαντες	1	Luke may be using the word “hear” in an idiomatic sense to mean “obey.” Alternate translation: “in obedience to this command from the angel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:21	df1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when Luke says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:21	l7uf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὸ τὸν ὄρθρον	1	The implication is that although the angel led the apostles out of the jail during the night, the sun was rising by the time they reached the temple courtyard. Alternate translation: “as it was beginning to get light” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:21	a377		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δὲ	1	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce other events that took place around the same time as the events he has just described. Alternate translation: “Meanwhile,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
5:21	a378		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παραγενόμενος	1	This does not mean that the high priest and his allies **arrived** in the temple courtyard where the apostles were. Rather, it means that they went into the chamber where the Sanhedrin met so that they could summon the rest of its members to join them there. Alternate translation: “having arrived in the council chamber” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:21	a379		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ Συνέδριον καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Γερουσίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ	1	The phrase **even all the elders of the sons of Israel** clarifies the name **Sanhedrin** by describing it membership. Luke is using the word **elders** here in a general sense to mean “leaders.” He is not making a distinction between “elders” and “rulers” as he does in [4:5](../04/05.md). Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, which was composed of the leaders of the sons of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:21	a380		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” Luke is identifying the Israelites as descendants of their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:21	li6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀπέστειλαν εἰς τὸ δεσμωτήριον	1	Luke is leaving out a word that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. He means that the high priest and his allies sent someone to the prison to get the apostles. Alternate translation: “sent someone to the prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:23	a381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ δεσμωτήριον εὕρομεν κεκλεισμένον ἐν πάσῃ ἀσφαλείᾳ, καὶ τοὺς φύλακας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form in place of the passive form **shut**, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “We found that the guards had shut the prison in all security and we found the guards” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:23	a382		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ἀσφαλείᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **security**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “securely.” The word **all** is an intensifier. Alternate translation: “very securely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:23	a383		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνοίξαντες	1	Your language may require you to specify the object of **opened**. Alternate translation: “once we opened the doors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:23	ld7d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἔσω οὐδένα εὕρομεν	1	By **no one**, the officers mean that they found none of the men they had been sent to bring, that is, none of the apostles. It is possible that other people were also being held in the prison, but the angel would not have released them, and they would still have been inside. Alternate translation: “we did not find any of the apostles inside” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
5:24	k5g6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	Luke is using the term **words** to mean the report that the officers gave. Alternate translation: “this report” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:24	baw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	περὶ αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **them** does not refer to the apostles but to the **words** that the officers spoke in giving their report. Alternate translation: “about the things the officers had told them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:24	p78m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τί ἂν γένοιτο τοῦτο	1	The expression **what this might become** refers to a possible result. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “wondering what would happen as a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:25	a384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, οἱ ἄνδρες	1	This person says **Behold** to get the council members to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Right now the men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:25	a8dz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ἔθεσθε	1	Here the word **you** refers to the captain of the temple and the chief priests and so it is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
5:25	c1am		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, ἑστῶτες	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when the messenger says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple. Alternate translation: “standing in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:26	e24h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τότε ἀπελθὼν, ὁ στρατηγὸς σὺν τοῖς ὑπηρέταις ἦγεν αὐτούς, οὐ μετὰ βίας, ἐφοβοῦντο γὰρ τὸν λαόν, μὴ λιθασθῶσιν	1	The first instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles, but the second instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the captain and the officers. The captain and officers were not afraid that the people would stone the apostles. They were afraid that they would be stoned themselves if they used violence against the apostles. You could reword this to make the referents clear. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “Then the captain went with the officers and brought the apostles back. But the captain and officers did not use any violence, because they were afraid that the people would stone them if they did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:27	iq7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀγαγόντες δὲ αὐτοὺς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles in all three instances in this verse. It may be helpful to specify this here in the first instance. Alternate translation: “Once they had brought the apostles back” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:28	a385			παραγγελίᾳ παρηγγείλαμεν ὑμῖν	1	For emphasis, the high priest is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. If your language uses the same construction for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of conveying this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we commanded you very strictly”
5:28	f7pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν & πεπληρώκατε & ὑμῶν & βούλεσθε	1	In this verse the words **you** and **your** refer to the apostles, and so those words are plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
5:28	g2hi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ	1	The high priest is using the term **name** to mean the person of Jesus. See how you translated the similar expression in [4:17](../04/17.md). Alternate translation: “about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:28	a386		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, πεπληρώκατε	1	The high priest says **behold** to get the apostles to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “nevertheless you have filled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:28	j4kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πεπληρώκατε τὴν Ἰερουσαλὴμ τῆς διδαχῆς ὑμῶν	1	The high priest is speaking of the city of **Jerusalem** as if it were a container that the apostles had **filled** with their teaching. Alternate translation: “you have taught people who live in every part of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:28	a387		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βούλεσθε ἐπαγαγεῖν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς	1	The high priest is speaking as if the apostles wanted to put the blood of Jesus on him and his fellow Jewish leaders. Alternate translation: “you want to make us responsible for” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:28	a388		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	By **us**, the high priest means himself and his fellow Jewish leaders, but not the apostles to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:28	ym1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ αἷμα	1	The high priest is using the term **blood** to mean death by association with the way Jesus’ blood was shed when he died. Alternate translation: “the death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:28	a389		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τούτου	1	The phrase **this man** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “this man Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:29	a390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς & Πέτρος καὶ οἱ ἀπόστολοι εἶπαν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Peter and the other apostles responded to the high priest. Alternate translation: “Peter and the apostles responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
5:29	di9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Πέτρος καὶ οἱ ἀπόστολοι εἶπαν	1	Luke seems to mean implicitly that Peter said what follows on behalf of all of the apostles. Alternate translation: “Peter said on behalf of all of the apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:29	a391		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “human beings.” Alternate translation: “human beings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
5:30	a392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	Peter is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “of our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:30	kwsc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “of our fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
5:30	r7av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤγειρεν Ἰησοῦν	1	As in [2:24](../02/24.md), the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “brought Jesus back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:30	a393		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὃν ὑμεῖς διεχειρίσασθε	1	The word **you** is plural. Even though Peter is responding to the high priest, who has been interrogating the apostles, Peter is referring here to the entire council. If your language does not use separate forms for singular and plural “you,” you could indicate that in some other way. Alternate translation: “whom you Sanhedrin members killed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
5:30	a394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὃν ὑμεῖς διεχειρίσασθε	1	It was the Romans who literally killed Jesus, but Peter says that the Sanhedrin members killed him because their demands led to his death. Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be killed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
5:30	pu5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου	1	The word translated as **tree** can mean either an actual tree or something made of wood. Peter is using the word to refer to the cross, which was made out of wood. Alternate translation: “having hung him on a wooden cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:30	a395		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου	1	In some languages the word **hung** would suggest a different method of execution. For clarity, you could use a different word that might indicate the actual meaning better. Alternate translation: “having suspended him from a wooden cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:31	a396		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῦτον	1	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Jesus. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could specify whom Peter means. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “this Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:31	a397		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ	1	Peter is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate the right side. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:25](../02/25.md). Alternate translation: “to his right side” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:31	uh2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ	1	God placing Jesus at his **right** side was a symbolic way of giving him great honor. Alternate translation: “to a place of great honor next to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
5:31	mr1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τοῦ δοῦναι μετάνοιαν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **repentance** and **forgiveness**, you could express the same ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “to give the people of Israel an opportunity to repent and have God forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:31	q1il		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	Ἰσραὴλ	1	Peter is referring to all of the people of Israel as if they were a single person, their ancestor, **Israel**. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
5:32	a398		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	Peter is addressing the Sanhedrin, but he is using the word **we** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **we** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “we apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:32	a399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς πειθαρχοῦσιν αὐτῷ	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying him, is also a witness of these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:32	yml6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς πειθαρχοῦσιν αὐτῷ	1	Here at the end of his response to the high priest, Peter is echoing what he said at the beginning: “It is necessary to obey God rather than men.” He is defining himself and his fellow apostles as people who are committed to obeying God and to testifying about Jesus even if the authorities forbid them to do that. Peter is saying that God has given the apostles the Holy Spirit to empower them to give that testimony in obedience to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “whom God has given us to empower us to obey him by testifying about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:33	abx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ & ἀκούσαντες διεπρίοντο, καὶ ἐβούλοντο ἀνελεῖν αὐτούς	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the council members and the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles.

5:34	i2rr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	τις & Φαρισαῖος ὀνόματι Γαμαλιήλ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
5:34	a401		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Γαμαλιήλ	1	**Gamaliel** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
5:34	a402		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	νομοδιδάσκαλος τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	Luke provides this background information about Gamaliel to help readers understand what happens next in the story, when the council members follow Gamaliel’s advice to be patient rather than acting immediately against the apostles. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. It may be helpful to do that in a separate sentence, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
5:34	fpr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whom all the people honored” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:34	a403		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	The word **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “whom the people greatly honored” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
5:34	a404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1	Here, **rising up** means that Gamaliel stood up. He did that to indicate that he had something important to say. Alternate translation: “standing up to show that he had something important to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
5:34	xk6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκέλευσεν ἔξω & τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ποιῆσαι	1	Your language may require you to specify the object of **commanded**. Alternate translation: “commanded the officers to take the apostles outside” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:34	a405		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	βραχὺ	1	Luke is using the adjective **little** as a noun in order to indicate a length of time. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could supply a word such as “while” to show this. Alternate translation: “for a little while” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:35	a406		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	τε	1	Luke is using the word translated **And** to indicate that Gamaliel spoke after the officers had taken the apostles out of the council chamber. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
5:35	a407		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰσραηλεῖται	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:35	ae1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις τί μέλλετε πράσσειν	1	Gamaliel is warning the council members not to do something that they will later regret. He means “be very careful about what you do to these men,” and you could state that as an alternate translation. However, the implication is that the council should not kill the apostles, as [5:33](../05/33.md) says they want to do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you need to be very cautious and not kill these men, because you might deeply regret that later” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:36	a408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸ & τούτων τῶν ἡμερῶν	1	Gamaliel is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “some time ago” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:36	a409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Θευδᾶς	1	**Theudas** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
5:36	uaj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνέστη	1	In this context, **rose up** means that Theudas rebelled against the Roman government. Alternate translation: “rebelled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:36	b3nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	λέγων εἶναί τινα ἑαυτόν	1	In this context, the expression **somebody** means a person of importance. Your language may use this expression in the same way. Or, if it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “saying that he was an important person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:36	a410		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ᾧ προσεκλίθη ἀνδρῶν ἀριθμὸς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “whom a number of men joined” or, as a new sentence, “A number of men joined him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:36	ie3x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς ἀνῃρέθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. It may be helpful to begin another new sentence here. Alternate translation: “whom the Romans killed” or, as a new sentence, “But the Romans killed him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:36	juz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅσοι ἐπείθοντο αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “as many as he had persuaded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

5:37	f33y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	μετὰ τοῦτον	1	Gamaliel is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Theudas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could use a pronoun or this man’s name. Alternate translation: “After him” or “After Theudas” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:37	a412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰούδας ὁ Γαλιλαῖος	1	The word **Judas** is the name of a man. See how you translated the same name in [1:13](../01/13.md) and [1:16](../01/16.md). (Those verses describe two other men with this name, not the same Judas as here.) **Galilean** is the name for someone who is from the region of Galilee. See how you translated that name in [1:11](../01/11.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
5:37	a413		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνέστη	1	As in [5:36](../05/36.md), **rose up** here means that Judas rebelled against the Roman government. Alternate translation: “rebelled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:37	p56f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῆς ἀπογραφῆς	1	Gamaliel is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at the time of the census” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:37	kz4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπέστησε λαὸν ὀπίσω αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **drew away** is an idiom that means Judas persuaded people to rebel with him against the Roman government. Alternate translation: “persuaded people to join him in rebellion” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:37	a414		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	κἀκεῖνος	1	Gamaliel is using the demonstrative adjective **that** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Judas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you use a pronoun or this man’s name. Alternate translation: “He also” or “Judas also” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:37	a415		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅσοι ἐπείθοντο αὐτῷ	1	If your language would not use the passive form **were persuaded**, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “as many as he had persuaded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:37	a416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διεσκορπίσθησαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “scattered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:38	i4bw			καὶ τὰ νῦν λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Gamaliel uses this expression to shift the council members’ attention away from the stories of Theudas and Judas so that he could give them some direct advice. In your translation, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that would be natural for this same purpose.
5:38	a417		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Gamaliel is using the word translated **And** to introduce what he wants the council to conclude as a result of the two examples he has given. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:38	wz89			ἀπόστητε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων τούτων καὶ ἄφετε αὐτούς	1	When Gamaliel tells the council to **keep away from these men**, he implicitly means that they should not execute them, as [5:33](../05/33.md) says they wanted to do. Alternate translation: “do not execute these men or put them back in prison”
5:38	zh1d			ἐὰν ᾖ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, ἡ βουλὴ αὕτη ἢ τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο	1	Alternate translation: “if men have devised this plan or are doing this work”
5:38	a418		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Gamaliel is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “humans.” Since he contrasts **from men** here with “from God” in the next verse, it may be appropriate to add the word “mere” to help show that contrast. Alternate translation: “mere humans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
5:38	uql8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταλυθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “someone will destroy it” or “it will not last” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:39	a419		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Gamaliel uses this word to introduce a contrast between what would happen if the work the apostles are doing were “from men” and what would happen if it were **from God**. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “However,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:39	j819		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἰ & ἐκ Θεοῦ ἐστιν	1	Here the pronoun **it** refers back to the phrase “this counsel or this work” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “if God has devised this plan or commanded these men to do this work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:39	a420		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μήποτε	1	It may be helpful to state the implications of the word **lest** explicitly. Alternate translation: “and if you do try to destroy them,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:39	a421		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ θεομάχοι εὑρεθῆτε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. However, since this is also an idiom (see next note), it would only be meaningful to do that in your translation if your language uses the verb “find” in the same idiomatic sense. Alternate translation: “people may even find you to be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:39	a422		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὑρεθῆτε	1	The expression **be found** means to turn out to be something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “turn out to be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:39	cyp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπείσθησαν & αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Gamaliel persuaded them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:40	z31c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the Sanhedrin did as a result of Gamaliel’s advice. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:40	p6lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	προσκαλεσάμενοι τοὺς ἀποστόλους, δείραντες παρήγγειλαν	1	The Sanhedrin would have ordered their officers to bring back the apostles and beat them. They did not do those things personally. But Luke speaks as if they did do those things because they ordered them to be done. Alternate translation: “they had their officers bring back the apostles and beat them, and then they commanded them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
5:40	fca9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	The Sanhedrin members are using the term **name** to mean the person of Jesus. See how you translated the similar expression in [4:17](../04/17.md). Alternate translation: “to speak about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:41	a423		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Συνεδρίου	1	Luke is using the word **face** to mean “presence.” Alternate translation: “from the presence of the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “God had considered them worthy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:41	lk82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματος	1	Here, **the Name** means Jesus. Alternate translation: “for Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:42	jj94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	τε	1	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after this story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
5:42	kyp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so when Luke says **the temple** here, he means the courtyard associated with the temple Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:42	x424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐκ ἐπαύοντο, διδάσκοντες καὶ εὐαγγελιζόμενοι	1	Luke is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “they continued to teach and to proclaim the gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
6:intro	z5r5				0	# Acts 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nActs [6:7](../06/07.md) is a summary statement that Luke uses to mark the end of the first major part of the book.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The distribution to the widows\n\nThe believers in Jerusalem gave food every day to women whose husbands had died. All of them had been raised as Jews, but some of them spoke Hebrew and had lived mostly in Judea, while others spoke Greek and may have lived in Gentile areas. Those who gave out the food gave it to the Hebrew-speaking widows but not equally to the Greek-speaking widows. To please God, the church leaders appointed Greek-speaking men to make sure the Greek-speaking widows received their share of the food. One of these Greek-speaking men was Stephen.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “His face was like the face of an angel”\n\nNo one knows for sure what it was about Stephen’s face that was like the face of an angel, because Luke does not tell us. A note to this phrase offers one suggestion, which you may choose to follow. However, you might also decide to say only what the ULT says about this.
6:1	f8br		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Luke uses this time reference to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
6:1	cg5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν & ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Luke is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that same time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “those who were distributing food each day were overlooking their widows” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:1	rde8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ διακονίᾳ τῇ καθημερινῇ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **service**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent expression.

6:2	n5r4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ δώδεκα	1	Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people, the apostles who led the church. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the 12 apostles” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
6:2	is74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

6:3	lcyx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “my fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:3	p1yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἄνδρας & μαρτυρουμένους	1	The expression **being attested** is a passive verbal form. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the same meaning with an active form. Alternate translation: “men to whose honesty people attest” or “men whom people say they trust” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:3	mgid		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλήρεις Πνεύματος καὶ σοφίας	1	The apostles are speaking of these men as if they were containers that the Holy Spirit and wisdom could fill.

6:3	pxe5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πλήρεις Πνεύματος καὶ σοφίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wisdom**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “wisely.” Alternate translation: “in whose lives the Spirit is evidently present and who act very wisely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:3	i27a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ τῆς χρείας ταύτης	1	When the apostles say that they will appoint these men **over** the work of food distribution, they are using a spatial metaphor. Alternate translation: “to be responsible for this task” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:4	b3bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ λόγου	1	The apostles are using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that God has told them to teach and preach by using words. Alternate translation: “of teaching and preaching the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:5	wh9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἤρεσεν ὁ λόγος ἐνώπιον παντὸς τοῦ πλήθους	1	Luke is using the word **before** to refer to the opinion of the believers, since people assess things that come to their attention in front of them. Alternate translation: “what the apostles recommended pleased all of the other believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:5	jayc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	2	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce what the believers did as a result of the apostles’ request. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

They are all Greek names, and this suggests that all of the men selected were from the group of Greek-speaking Jews among the believers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
6:5	vsyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἄνδρα πλήρης πίστεως καὶ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	Luke is speaking of Stephen as if he was a container that faith and the Holy Spirit had filled.

Alternate translation: “after they had prayed, they placed their hands upon them” (2) that the apostles placed their hands on the men while they were praying for them. Alternate translation: “they prayed for them with their hands placed upon them” or “they placed their hands upon them and prayed for them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
6:6	wu1y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπέθηκαν αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας	1	The apostles **placed their hands** on the seven men to show publicly that they were giving them the responsibility and authority to oversee the food distribution.

6:7	x48w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory		0	As the outline in the General Introduction indicates, this verse is the end of the first major section of the book of Acts. That section describes how the apostles spread the good news about Jesus in Jerusalem. Luke uses this verse to summarize what happened as a result of the events within this whole section of the book. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such a summary relates to a significant part of a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
6:7	wu4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν	1	Luke is speaking of the way the message about Jesus kept becoming more widespread as if the word of God itself were **growing**. Alternate translation: “more and more people were hearing the word of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:7	ueie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that God told the believers to spread by using words.

6:7	qq3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑπήκουον τῇ πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “came to believe in Jesus and so started obeying his teachings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:8	et2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Στέφανος δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce Stephen as the main character in this part of the story. Your language may have its own way of doing that. If so, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
6:8	pzr0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Στέφανος & πλήρης χάριτος καὶ δυνάμεως, ἐποίει	1	Luke is speaking as if Stephen were a container that **grace and power** were filling.

6:8	h8sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	Στέφανος & πλήρης χάριτος καὶ δυνάμεως, ἐποίει	1	Luke may be using the two words **grace** and **power** together to express a single idea.

Alternate translation: “Stephen, full of gracious power, was doing” or “Stephen, full of power from God, was doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
6:8	xscq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Στέφανος & πλήρης χάριτος καὶ δυνάμεως, ἐποίει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **grace** and **power**, you could express the same ideas with adverbs. Alternate translation: “Stephen was supernaturally and powerfully doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:8	m0zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα μεγάλα	1	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:22](../02/22.md). Alternate translation: “many great miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
6:9	d74m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνέστησαν	1	Here the expression **rose up** means that these people took action, specifically to oppose Stephen, not that they stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “took action to oppose Stephen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:9	nei0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῆς συναγωγῆς, τῆς λεγομένης Λιβερτίνων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the synagogue whose name was Freedmen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:9	k88n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς συναγωγῆς, τῆς λεγομένης Λιβερτίνων	1	The word **Freedmen** probably refers to former slaves. Alternate translation: “the synagogue that former slaves attended” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

The words **Cilicia** and **Asia** are the names of two Roman provinces. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
6:10	v5ia		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἴσχυον ἀντιστῆναι	1	In this context, the expression **stand against** means to try to defeat by argument. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they could not argue successfully against” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:10	fnb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τῇ σοφίᾳ καὶ τῷ Πνεύματι, ᾧ ἐλάλει	1	Luke may be using the two words **wisdom** and **Spirit** together to express a single idea. The word **Spirit** would describe the source and character of the **wisdom** that Stephen was displaying. The word **Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Spirit-inspired wisdom by which he spoke” or “the wisdom that the Holy Spirit gave him as he spoke” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
6:10	psha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ σοφίᾳ καὶ τῷ Πνεύματι, ᾧ ἐλάλει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wisdom**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “the wise things he said as the Spirit inspired him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:11	ren5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπέβαλον ἄνδρας λέγοντας	1	The word **instigated** means that Stephen’s opponents in some way persuaded these men to lie about what Stephen was saying. They may have offered them money, or they may have convinced them that Stephen was a dangerous person who needed to be stopped. Since Luke does not specify the means, it may be best not to suggest a means in your translation. But it would be appropriate to indicate that what these men were recruited to say about Stephen was a lie. Alternate translation: “recruited some men to lie about Stephen by saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:11	s2cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀκηκόαμεν	1	The men are using the word **We** to refer only to themselves, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:11	x747		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λαλοῦντος ῥήματα βλάσφημα	1	The men are using the term **words** to mean the things that Stephen has been saying by using words. Alternate translation: “saying blasphemous things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:12	tqk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	συνεκίνησάν	1	In this verse and the next one, the word “they” continues to refer back to the opponents of Stephen who are named in [6:9](../06/09.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
6:12	l251		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνεκίνησάν τε τὸν λαὸν, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	Luke says that Stephen’s opponents **stirred up** these other groups, as if calm waters were being disturbed. He means that they said things to make them very upset with Stephen. Alternate translation: “They also said things that made the people, the elders, and the scribes very upset with Stephen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:13	zv6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ παύεται λαλῶν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **stop**. Alternate translation: “continually speaks” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
6:13	ju6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λαλῶν ῥήματα	1	The men are using the term **words** to mean things that Stephen has been saying by using words. Alternate translation: “saying things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:13	o3j2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ τόπου τοῦ ἁγίου	1	The men are describing the temple in Jerusalem by referring to it by something associated with it, that it is a **holy place**. Alternate translation: “the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:14	uok4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν τόπον τοῦτον	1	By **this place**, the false witnesses mean the temple, which they described as “the holy place” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “this temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:14	vak4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ ἔθη ἃ παρέδωκεν ἡμῖν Μωϋσῆς	1	The phrase **handed down** is an idiom that refers to something that is passed from generation to generation. The false witnesses are describing how the ancestors of the Jews have passed on the teachings originally received from Moses to each successive generation. Alternate translation: “the customs that our ancestors learned from Moses and have taught each successive generation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:15	k8rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	εἶδον τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, ὡσεὶ πρόσωπον ἀγγέλου	1	Luke offers this comparison but he does not say specifically in what way Stephen’s face was like **the face of an angel**. However, this may mean that his face was shining brightly, since descriptions of angels in the Bible often say they were shining brightly. So you might choose to say that in your translation. Alternate translation: “saw that his face was shining brightly, like the face of an angel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
7:intro	p9h4				0	# Acts 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter presents Stephen’s defense against the charges that false witnesses had made against him, as Luke describes in [6:13–14](../06/13.md). Those witnesses had said, “This man does not stop speaking words against the holy place and the law. For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” In response, Stephen shows that he respects the law, but he then shows how the Israelites have not kept the law. He next shows that he respects the temple, but he then explains that God does not live in temples made by people. Luke presents Stephen’s speech within the narrative setting of his trial by the Sanhedrin.\n- (v. 1) The high priest asks Stephen to answer the charges against him\n- (vv. 2–19) Stephen tells the story of the Israelites up to the time of Moses\n- (vv. 20–37) Stephen explains how Moses gave the law\n- (vv. 38–43) Stephen shows that the Israelites did not keep the law that Moses gave\n- (vv. 44–47) Stephen tells how the tabernacle and temple were built\n- (vv. 48–50) Stephen explains that God does not live in temples that people build\n- (vv. 51–54) Stephen makes his own charges against the Sanhedrin members\n- (vv. 55–60) The Sanhedrin members, enraged, execute Stephen by stoning\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 7:42–43 and 49–50.\n\nA note to 7:36–38 suggests making each of these verses a separate paragraph or using formatting in some other way to highlight the repeated phrases that Stephen uses to describe Moses.\n\nIt appears that 8:1 is part of the narrative of this chapter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Stephen said”\n\nStephen told the history of Israel very briefly. He paid special attention to the times that the Israelites had rejected the people God had chosen to lead them. At the end of the story, he said that the Jewish leaders he was talking to had rejected Jesus just as the evil Israelites had always rejected the leaders God had appointed for them.\n\n### “Full of the Holy Spirit”\n\nThe Holy Spirit completely controlled Stephen so that he said only and all of what God wanted him to say.\n\n### Foreshadowing\n\nWhen an author speaks of something that is not important at that time but will be important later in the story, this is called foreshadowing. Luke mentions Saul in [7:58](../07/58.md), even though he is not an important person in this part of the story. This is because Saul, also known as Paul, is an important person in the rest of the Book of Acts.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Implied information\n\nStephen was talking to Jews who knew the law of Moses well, so he did not explain things that his hearers already knew. But you may need to explain some of these things so that your readers will be able to understand what Stephen was saying. For example, you may need to make explicit that when Joseph’s brothers “sold him into Egypt” ([Acts 7:9](../act/07/09.md)), Joseph was going to be a slave in Egypt. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Metonymy\n\nStephen spoke of Joseph ruling “over Egypt” and over all of Pharaoh’s household. By this he meant that Joseph ruled over the people of Egypt and of the people and possessions in Pharaoh’s household. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n## Important Textual issues in this Chapter\n\n### “a dwelling for the house of Jacob” (7:46)\n\nIn [7:46](../07/46.md), some ancient manuscripts read “a dwelling for the house of Jacob.” ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “a dwelling for the God of Jacob.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Background knowledge\n\nThe Jewish leaders to whom Stephen spoke already knew much about the events he was describing. They knew what Moses had written in the book of Genesis. If the book of Genesis has not been translated into your language, it may be difficult for your readers to follow what Stephen said. It may be helpful to provide some background information, either in the text or in notes.\n\n### Reference of “our” and “you”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Stephen uses the word “our” to refer to himself and to his listeners. When he means only them, he says “you,” and “you” is plural.
7:1	hy9r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἀρχιερεύς	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nLuke assumes that his readers will know that **the high priest** was there and that he asked Stephen to testify because he was a member of the Sanhedrin and its leader. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the high priest, who was the leader of the Sanhedrin,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:2	abc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ ἔφη	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Stephen, not the high priest. Alternate translation: “Then Stephen said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:2	zbq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες	1	The phrase **Men, brothers and fathers** is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You brothers and fathers of mine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:2	v5si		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες	1	Stephen is using the word **brothers** to refer to his fellow Israelites. He is likely using the word **fathers** to refer to the leaders of Israel, the members of the Sanhedrin. In both cases he is speaking respectfully. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites and you leaders of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:2	kfep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δόξης	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “The glorious God” or “God, who is glorious,” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:2	n09p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δόξης	1	Stephen apparently chooses to describe God in this way at the beginning of his speech in order to refute the charge made in [6:11](../06/11.md) that he says blasphemous things about God. Calling him the **God of glory** acknowledges that people should rightfully give glory to God. You might choose to bring out this implication in your translation. Alternate translation: “God, to whom we should rightfully give glory,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:2	pt4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	Here and throughout this chapter, Stephen is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
7:2	w1ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ πατρὶ ἡμῶν Ἀβραὰμ	1	Stephen is using the term **father** to mean “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “to Abraham our ancestor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:3	uksj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν, ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας σου, καὶ δεῦρο εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἄν σοι δείξω	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this verse so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “God told Abraham to go out from his land and from his relatives and come into the land that he would show him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:3	kgef		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God, while the pronoun **him** refers to Abraham. Alternate translation: “God said to Abraham” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:4	pfg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	κατῴκησεν & αὐτοῦ & μετῴκισεν αὐτὸν	1	The pronouns **his** and **him** and the first instance of the word **he** refer to Abraham, while the second instance of the word **he** refers to God. For clarity, in your translation you might say “Abraham lived” and “God brought him.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:4	pfg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμεῖς	1	The word **you** is plural. Stephen is using it to refer not just to the high priest, whose question he is answering, but also to all of the council members and the others who are listening to him. So you can use the plural form of the word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
7:5	tnsm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ & ἐπηγγείλατο & αὐτῷ & αὐτοῦ & αὐτόν & οὐκ ὄντος αὐτῷ	1	The pronouns **him** and **his** and the third instance of **he** refer to Abraham, while the first two instances of **he** refer to God. For clarity, in your translation you might say “God did not give Abraham,” “God promised,” and “although Abraham did not have.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:5	ax1j			οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κληρονομίαν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Alternate translation: “he did not give any of it to him as an inheritance”
7:5	qff6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδὲ βῆμα ποδός	1	This could mean: (1) not enough ground to stand on or (2) not enough ground on which to take a step. Either way, the expression is implicitly describing a very small area. Alternate translation: “not even a tiny piece of ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:5	u6iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτῷ εἰς κατάσχεσιν & καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτόν	1	The term **seed** means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:5	j09v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	αὐτῷ εἰς κατάσχεσιν & καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτόν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **possession** with a verb such as “possess.” Stephen is saying that Abraham possessed the land in the sense that it was something that God had promised to him but that it was his descendants who came into actual possession of it. Alternate translation: “as something that his descendants would one day possess” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:6	orw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἐλάλησεν δὲ οὕτως ὁ Θεὸς ὅτι ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, πάροικον ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ, καὶ δουλώσουσιν αὐτὸ καὶ κακώσουσιν ἔτη τετρακόσια	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “But God spoke to him like this, ‘Your seed would be a stranger in a foreign land, and they will enslave him and treat him badly for 400 years’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
7:6	tn6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλάλησεν & οὕτως ὁ Θεὸς	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this occurred some time after the statement in the previous verse. It may be helpful to state that in your translation. Alternate translation: “Subsequently God told Abraham that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:6	jymv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, πάροικον ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ, καὶ δουλώσουσιν αὐτὸ καὶ κακώσουσιν	1	Stephen is using the singular word **seed** to mean “descendants,” and so he uses the singular noun **stranger** and the singular pronoun **him**. For clarity in your translation, to show that he is not referring to a single individual, you could state “descendants” and “strangers” and use the plural pronoun **them**. Alternate translation: “his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land, whose people would enslave them and treat them badly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:7	k8pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ τὸ ἔθνος ᾧ ἐὰν δουλεύσωσιν κρινῶ ἐγώ, ὁ Θεὸς εἶπεν; καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα, ἐξελεύσονται καὶ λατρεύσουσίν μοι ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But God said that he would judge the nation that would enslave him and that after that they would come out and serve him in this place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:7	f7fw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ἔθνος	1	Here, **nation** refers to the people who belong to that nation. Alternate translation: “the people of the nation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:7	q7y6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐὰν δουλεύσωσιν	1	As in [7:6](../07/06.md), Stephen is using the singular pronoun **him** because he is using the singular word **seed** to mean “descendants.” For clarity, particularly if you said “descendants” in the previous verse, you could use the plural pronoun “them” instead. That would help readers recognize that Stephen also means Abraham’s descendants when he says “they” later in the verse. Alternate translation: “will enslave them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:8	iwfx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ & ἐγέννησεν	1	The first instance of the pronoun **he** refers to God, while the word **him** and the second instance of the pronoun **he** refer to Abraham. For clarity, in your translation you might say “God gave Abraham … Abraham fathered.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:8	mwc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ διαθήκην περιτομῆς	1	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this **covenant** required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family. Alternate translation: “he made a covenant that required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:8	g67f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὸν Ἰσαὰκ & τὸν Ἰακώβ	1	These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
7:8	ams1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰακὼβ τοὺς δώδεκα πατριάρχας	1	Stephen is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the 12 patriarchs” or “and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the 12 patriarchs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:8	gaww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς δώδεκα πατριάρχας	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is using the word **patriarchs** to mean the sons of Jacob who became the ancestors of the tribes of Israel. Alternate translation: “12 sons who became the ancestors of the tribes of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:9	n981		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	οἱ πατριάρχαι	1	Here the word **patriarchs** refers to the older sons of Jacob in their relationship with Joseph. If you refer to them in your translation as Joseph’s brothers, use the word for an older brother if your language makes that distinction. Alternate translation: “Jacob’s older sons” or “Joseph’s older brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
7:9	tik7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέδοντο εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this meant that their ancestors sold Joseph into slavery and that he was taken to Egypt to be a slave there. Alternate translation: “sold him into slavery and he was taken to Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:9	w1is		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἦν & μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	When Stephen says that God **was with** Joseph, this is an idiom that means God helped him. Alternate translation: “helped him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:10	kxgk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ πασῶν τῶν θλίψεων αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ	1	In these phrases the word **he** refers to God and the words **him** and **his** refer to Joseph. Alternate translation: “God rescued Joseph from all his afflictions, and God gave Joseph” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:10	bfoo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ χάριν καὶ σοφίαν ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **favor** and **wisdom** with adjectives. Alternate translation: “God made Pharaoh favorable towards Joseph and enabled Joseph to give Pharaoh wise advice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:10	vpir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1	Here the phrase **before Pharaoh** may be an idiom that means “in the presence of.” Alternate translation: “whenever he was in the presence of Pharaoh” or see next note for another possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:10	s5vk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1	The phrase **before Pharaoh** could also refer to Pharaoh’s opinion by association with the way that Pharaoh would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “in Pharaoh’s perspective” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:10	nycs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἡγούμενον ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ὅλον τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	In these phrases the words **he** and **his** refer to Pharaoh and the word **him** refers to Joseph. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh appointed Joseph governor over Egypt and all his household” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:10	yr7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	The word **Egypt** refers to the people of Egypt. Alternate translation: “over all the people of Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:10	pb4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὅλον τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	The word **household** refers to Pharaoh’s own servants and all his possessions. Alternate translation: “over all his servants and everything he owned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:11	p42j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἦλθεν & λιμὸς ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Χανάαν, καὶ θλῖψις μεγάλη	1	Here, Stephen speaks of **famine** and **tribulation** as if they **came** to Egypt and Canaan on their own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “there was a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and there was great tribulation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:11	frd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ θλῖψις μεγάλη	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **tribulation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and people suffered greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:11	p37v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” He means specifically Jacob and his sons (Joseph’s older brothers), as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:12	pia8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὄντα σιτία εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	Stephen assumes that his readers will know that with Joseph as his administrator, Pharaoh had stored up grain during prosperous years and was now selling it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that people could buy stored grain from Pharaoh in Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:12	cvhm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξαπέστειλεν τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν πρῶτον	1	By **first**, Stephen does not mean that Jacob sent Joseph’s older brothers to Egypt before he sent anyone else, or before he did anything else. He means that Jacob sent them for a first time and would later send them for a second time, as Stephen’s listeners would have understood. Alternate translation: “he sent our fathers on a first trip there to buy food” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:12	mbg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν	1	Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Here he means specifically Joseph’s older brothers, as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:13	a5f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ	1	Stephen is using the adjective **second** as a noun, to mean the second time that Joseph’s brothers went to Egypt. ULT adds **time** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “when Jacob sent them to Egypt again to buy more food” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
7:13	ce2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “during trip number two” or “on their next trip” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
7:13	m37e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀνεγνωρίσθη Ἰωσὴφ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Joseph made himself known to his brothers” or “Joseph revealed to his brothers his identity as their brother” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:13	jxk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φανερὸν ἐγένετο τῷ Φαραὼ τὸ γένος Ἰωσήφ	1	The phrase **became known** is not actually a passive form in Greek, but it might sound like one in other languages. If your language does not use passive forms, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh learned that they were Joseph’s family” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:14	aam5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἀποστείλας & Ἰωσὴφ μετεκαλέσατο Ἰακὼβ	1	Stephen means that Joseph sent his brothers back home in order to get their father Jacob. Alternate translation: “Joseph sent his brothers back to Canaan to get Jacob” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
7:14	wl32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ψυχαῖς ἑβδομήκοντα πέντε	1	Stephen is using a Hebrew idiom here. Alternate translation: “who amounted to 75 people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:15	zasp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατέβη Ἰακὼβ εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	Stephen says that Jacob **went down** because he traveled from the hilly and mountainous terrain of Canaan to the lowlying land of Egypt. Alternate translation: “Jacob traveled to Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:15	w2sm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐτελεύτησεν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	Stephen’s listeners would have known that Jacob and his sons lived in Egypt for some time. Make sure that your translation does not make it sound as if they **died** as soon as they arrived in Egypt. Alternate translation: “eventually Jacob and our ancestors died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:15	fe56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Here he means specifically Jacob’s sons (Joseph’s older brothers), as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “Jacob and his sons who became our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:16	slg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετετέθησαν εἰς Συχὲμ, καὶ ἐτέθησαν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Jacob’s descendants brought his body and his son’s bodies to Shechem and buried them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:16	la8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τιμῆς ἀργυρίου	1	Stephen is referring to money by association with the way, in this culture, people used **silver** as money. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for a sum of money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:17	tuq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	καθὼς δὲ ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας & ηὔξησεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ἐπληθύνθη	1	In your language it may be helpful to say that the people **increased and multiplied** before saying that **the time of the promise** approached. Alternate translation: “the people increased and multiplied in Egypt as the time of the promise … approached” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
7:17	kh8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	καθὼς & ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἧς ὡμολόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	Stephen is speaking of this **time** as if it were a person and could have **approached** on its own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time for God to fulfill the promise he had sworn to Abraham” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:17	tlh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθὼς & ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἧς ὡμολόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	Stephen is referring to **the promise** that he described in [7:7](../07/07.md). God promised Abraham that he would deliver his descendants from a nation that would enslave them and that he would bring them back to the land of Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as the time approached of the promise that God had sworn to Abraham, that he would deliver his descendants from slavery and bring them back to Canaan,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:17	s2oe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ηὔξησεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ἐπληθύνθη	1	Stephen is using the two words **increased** and **multiplied** together to express a single idea. The word **multiplied** tells in what way the people **increased**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “the people increased greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
7:18	whe7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνέστη βασιλεὺς ἕτερος ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	When Stephen says that this next king **arose**, he is using a spatial metaphor to mean that this king began his reign. Alternate translation: “another king began to rule over Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:18	g2wq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	The word **Egypt** refers to the people of Egypt. Alternate translation: “over the people of Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:18	e2y6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὃς οὐκ ᾔδει τὸν Ἰωσήφ	1	Stephen is not saying that this king **did not know Joseph** personally. Joseph had been dead for centuries by this point. Rather, **Joseph** refers to the reputation of Joseph. Alternate translation: “who did not know that Joseph had helped Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:19	qwbi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1	**He** refers to the new king of Egypt, not to Joseph. Alternate translation: “This king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:19	z312		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας	1	Here and frequently throughout the rest of his speech to the Sanhedrin, Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If your readers might not understand this, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:19	ug6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς πατέρας	1	Although the term **fathers** is masculine, when Stephen uses it to mean “ancestors,” it has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Here and throughout the speech, if you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “our fathers and mothers” to indicate this generic sense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
7:19	rh3k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ ποιεῖν τὰ βρέφη ἔκθετα αὐτῶν	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that by **exposed** he means “left outside.” This was an unfortunate means of infanticide in the ancient world. Alternate translation: “forcing them to leave their babies outside” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:19	n2vl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	εἰς τὸ μὴ ζῳογονεῖσθαι	1	Stephen is using a double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **keep alive**, which was negative from Pharaoh’s perspective, since it was contrary to his intentions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “in order to kill them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
7:20	nib6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐν ᾧ καιρῷ	1	Stephen uses this phrase to introduce something that happened while Pharaoh was trying to kill the Israelite babies. Alternate translation: “While this was happening,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
7:20	q66s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐγεννήθη Μωϋσῆς	1	Here Stephen introduces **Moses** into his story. See how you translated his name in [3:22](../03/22.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
7:20	cz9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγεννήθη Μωϋσῆς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the birth of Moses took place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:20	cd5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἦν ἀστεῖος τῷ Θεῷ	1	This could mean: (1) that Moses was **beautiful** in God’s perspective. Alternate translation: “God considered him to be beautiful” (2) in an idiiom, that Moses was very **beautiful**. Alternate translation: “he was very beautiful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:20	pnb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς ἀνετράφη & ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could make Moses’ parents the subject. Alternate translation: “his parents cared for him … in their home” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:21	w3iu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκτεθέντος δὲ αὐτοῦ	1	Moses **was exposed** because of Pharaoh’s command. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context suggests that it was Moses’ parents. Alternate translation: “when his parents had to place him outside” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:21	el3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνείλατο αὐτὸν	1	This could mean: (1) that Pharaoh’s daughter adopted Moses. The verb can have this figurative legal meaning. Alternate translation: “adopted him” (2) that she lifted him up out of the basket he was in on the banks of the Nile. (This story is told in Exodus [2:1–10](../exo/02/01.md).) Alternate translation: “rescued him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:22	c9nw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπαιδεύθη Μωϋσῆς πάσῃ σοφίᾳ Αἰγυπτίων	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Egyptians educated Moses in all of their wisdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:22	att9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάσῃ σοφίᾳ Αἰγυπτίων	1	Stephen says **all** as an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “thoroughly in the wisdom of the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
7:22	m3dm			δυνατὸς ἐν λόγοις καὶ ἔργοις αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “effective in his speech and actions” or “influential in what he said and did”
7:23	o4cg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὡς & ἐπληροῦτο αὐτῷ τεσσερακονταετὴς χρόνος	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after Moses had turned forty” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:23	b9gd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς & ἐπληροῦτο αὐτῷ τεσσερακονταετὴς χρόνος	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:23	ckxj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ	1	The expression **it came up on his heart** means that Moses felt a desire. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:23	fj9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **heart** is a metonym for the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:23	x493		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ	1	Stephen is using the word **brothers** to mean “kinsmen,” and he is using the word **sons** to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: “his kinsmen, the descendants of Israel” or, if the word “Israel” might make your readers think of the nation rather than the person, “his kinsmen, the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:23	i4ko		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ	1	Although the terms **brothers** and **sons** are masculine, Stephen is using these words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you decide to retain the metaphor in your translation, you could state “brothers and sisters” and “sons and daughters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
7:24	l4zv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἰδών τινα ἀδικούμενον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was **the Egyptian** who is mentioned later in the verse. Alternate translation: “seeing an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:24	y3yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐποίησεν ἐκδίκησιν τῷ καταπονουμένῳ, πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “avenged him by striking the Egyptian who was oppressing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:24	r2e8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses hit **the Egyptian** so hard that he died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “striking and killing the Egyptian” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:25	hrsh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	Stephen is using the word **brothers** to mean “kinsmen.” Alternate translation: “his kinsmen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:25	f6sn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δίδωσιν σωτηρίαν αὐτοῖς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. In context, the word refers to God using Moses to deliver the Israelites from slavery. Alternate translation: “was delivering them from slavery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:25	nhb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **hand** refers to the actions of Moses. Alternate translation: “through his actions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:26	t2vc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτοῖς	1	It is clear from the context that these were two Israelite men, though Stephen does not say that specifically. Alternate translation: “to two Israelite men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:26	qyc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς & αὐτοὺς & ἐστε & ἀδικεῖτε	1	Since Moses is speaking to two people, these uses of **them** and **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, they would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
7:26	mpc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	συνήλλασσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς εἰρήνην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he urged them to stop fighting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:26	kyde		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπών, ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί ἐστε. ἱνα τί ἀδικεῖτε ἀλλήλους?	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “telling them that they were brothers and asking them why they were hurting each other” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:26	zzt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Translate it with an expression that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Friends” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:26	z5g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	Moses is using the word **brothers** to mean “kinsmen.” Alternate translation: “kinsmen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:26	k1ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἱνα τί ἀδικεῖτε ἀλλήλους?	1	Moses is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not be hurting each other!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:27	xef7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1	The word **him** refers to Moses, not to the neighbor. Alternate translation: “Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:27	iq30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπών, τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐφ’ ἡμῶν?	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “asking him who appointed him a ruler and a judge over them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:27	q2r4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐφ’ ἡμῶν?	1	The man is using a rhetorical question to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No one appointed you a ruler and judge over us!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:27	wtq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν	1	In this context, the words **ruler** and **judge** mean basically the same thing. The man is using repetition to emphasize the fact that he feels that Moses has no authority over them. If your language does not use repetition for such a purpose, you could use a single phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “an authority with power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:27	t1hw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	The man is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his neighbor, but not to Moses, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
7:28	vow8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **do you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
7:28	hk1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον?	1	The man is using a rhetorical question implicitly to threaten Moses by indicating that he and probably others knew that Moses had killed the Egyptian. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I suppose you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:28	qfxh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον?	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The man asked Moses if he wanted to kill him the way he had killed the Egyptian the day before.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:28	jxka			ὃν τρόπον	1	Alternate translation: “in the same way in which”
7:29	l149		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔφυγεν & Μωϋσῆς ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1	The implication is that Moses fled because he recognized that these Israelites, and probably others, knew that he had killed an Egyptian. Moses feared that he would be punished or even killed for this crime. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Moses ran away at this word to try to escape from being punished” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:29	rbhm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1	Stephen is using the term **word** to mean what the man said by using words. Alternate translation: “at this statement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:29	q8qv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς δύο	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses married a Midianite woman when he fled from Egypt. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “where he married a Midianite woman and fathered two sons” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:30	zx1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πληρωθέντων ἐτῶν τεσσεράκοντα	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after 40 years had gone by” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:30	qci0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πληρωθέντων ἐτῶν τεσσεράκοντα	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:30	veft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὤφθη αὐτῷ & ἄγγελος	1	The word **appeared** does not mean that Moses simply saw this angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Moses. Alternate translation: “suddenly an angel was there with Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:30	f7yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὤφθη αὐτῷ & ἄγγελος	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners know that God came to speak with Moses through the **angel**. The UST makes this explicit. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:31	q6w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐθαύμασεν τὸ ὅραμα	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses **admired the sight** because the bush was not burning up, even though it was on fire. Alternate translation: “marveled at what he saw, because the fire was not consuming the bush” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:31	uk7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐγένετο φωνὴ Κυρίου	1	Stephen is speaking of **the voice of the Lord** as if it were a person and that it **came** on its own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the Lord spoke to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:32	b26o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων σου, ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ Ἰακώβ	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The Lord told Moses that he was the God of his fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:33	bpml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν & αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου, ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “the Lord told Moses to untie the sandals that were on his feet, because the place on which he was standing was holy ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:33	x7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου, ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1	In this culture, removing footwear was a symbolic way of acknowledging that a place was sacred. Footwear that had been worn elsewhere should not touch it. Your readers may understand the symbolic meaning of this action. If not, you could explain it in your translation. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them to acknowledge that the place on which you are standing is holy ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
7:33	rxnj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	The implication is that God wanted Moses not only to untie his sandals but also to remove them. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them from your feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:33	xl9p			τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	Since this refers to both sandals, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **sandals**. If your language uses the dual form, it would be appropriate to use that here. Alternate translation: “the sandals on your feet” or “the sandals you are wearing”
7:33	clk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1	The implication is that where God is present, the immediate area around God is considered or made **holy** by God. Alternate translation: “for the place on which you are standing has been made holy by my presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:34	l0au		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἰδὼν, εἶδον τὴν κάκωσιν τοῦ λαοῦ μου τοῦ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ τοῦ στεναγμοῦ αὐτῶν ἤκουσα, καὶ κατέβην ἐξελέσθαι αὐτούς; καὶ νῦν δεῦρο, ἀποστείλω σε εἰς Αἴγυπτον.	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The Lord said that he had certainly seen the oppression of his people who were in Egypt and that he had heard their groaning and that he had come down to rescue them. He told Moses to get ready because he was sending him to Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:34	yz7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἰδὼν, εἶδον	1	Stephen is reproducing a Hebrew idiom from the biblical account of Moses at the burning bush. The verb **seen** is repeated in Hebrew. This repetition expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having seen how his people were being oppressed. This Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:34	x5bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ λαοῦ μου	1	God uses the possessive word **my** to emphasize that these people were in a covenant relationship with him based on his promises to their ancestors. Alternate translation: “of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
7:34	j32c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατέβην ἐξελέσθαι αὐτούς	1	God describes himself as having **come down** from heaven to earth to help the Israelites. His presence was in the burning bush, but he also means that he is taking action to **rescue** them. Alternate translation: “I will personally bring about their release” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:34	atdo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3	God is using the word translated **And** to introduce what he wants Moses to do as a result of what he has told him. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:34	sq8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	νῦν δεῦρο	1	God is giving an order here. Alternate translation: “get ready” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
7:34	x34c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀποστείλω σε εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	God is not asking Moses’ permission when he says **let me send you to Egypt**. This is a way of saying “I will send you to Egypt,” and that statement in turn is functioning as a command. Alternate translation: “you must go to Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
7:35-38	x4p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	τοῦτον τὸν Μωϋσῆν	1	Verses 35, 36, 37, and 38 contains a series of similar phrases emphasizing the role of Moses. Stephen says **This Moses**, “This one,” “This is the Moses,” and “This is the one.” If possible, use similar statements in your own translation to emphasize Moses. You may also wish to make each of these verses a separate paragraph or use formatting in some other way to highlight the repeated phrases. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
7:35	nv5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπόντες, τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν?	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. See what you did in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “asking him who appointed him a ruler and a judge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:35	vuqy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν?	1	See how you translated this rhetorical question in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “No one appointed you a ruler and a judge!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:35	oic6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν	1	See how you translated the combination of **ruler** and **judge** in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “an authority with power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:35	vp7e			λυτρωτὴν	1	In this context, the word translated **redeemer** refers to someone who delivers people from earthly troubles, not someone who brings eternal salvation. Alternate translation: “a rescuer”
7:35	yjz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σὺν χειρὶ ἀγγέλου	1	Here, **hand** is a metonym for the capability and actions of someone. Alternate translation: “accompanied by the power of the angel” or “through the actions of the angel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:35	abc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὀφθέντος αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ βάτῳ	1	See how you translated the word **appeared** in [7:30](../07/30.md). Here as well, the word does not mean that Moses simply saw this angel in a vision. Alternate translation: “who was with him at the bush” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:36	gz9r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα	1	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Stephen is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:22](../02/22.md). Alternate translation: “great miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:36	n75x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἐρυθρᾷ Θαλάσσῃ	1	Stephen is using the name that was common in his culture, **the Red Sea**, to refer to the body of water that the Old Testament calls “the Sea of Reeds.” Decide whether you want to use the name that Stephen uses here or the name that you are using in your translation in the Old Testament, if they are different. Alternate translation: “the Sea of Reeds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
7:37	k710		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὁ εἴπας τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, προφήτην ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει ὁ Θεὸς, ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐμέ	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “who told the sons of Israel that God would raise up a prophet like him for them from their brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:37	vykp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ	1	Stephen is using the word **sons** to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: “to the descendants of Israel” or “to the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:37	b4sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	προφήτην ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει & ὡς ἐμέ	1	Here, the expression **raise up** describes God giving someone the mission to go as a prophet to certain people. See how you translated it in [3:22](../03/22.md). Alternate translation: “will send you a prophet like me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:37	j2rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν	1	Stephen is using the word **brothers** to mean “kinsmen.” Alternate translation: “your kinsmen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:38	fd25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ γενόμενος	1	**This is the one** refers to Moses. You may have decided to use similar language and special formatting in verses 35–38 to highlight the way Stephen is emphasizing Moses. However, if you think the reference would not be clear at this point, you could state his name. Alternate translation: “Moses is the one who was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:38	z1z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	μετὰ τοῦ ἀγγέλου τοῦ λαλοῦντος αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ Ὄρει Σινά, καὶ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὃς ἐδέξατο λόγια ζῶντα	1	It might be more natural to put the information about **Mount Sinai** next to the information about Moses receiving **living words**. Alternate translation: “with our fathers and with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, who received living words” or “with our fathers and with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, where he received living words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
7:38	vdnz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὃς ἐδέξατο	1	This second instance of **who** in the verse refers to Moses, not to the **fathers**. For clarity, you could state his name and start a new sentence. Alternate translation: “with our fathers. Moses received” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:38	y2zu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃς ἐδέξατο λόγια ζῶντα	1	It may be helpful in your language to specify who gave Moses the **words** that he **received.** Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this was God. Alternate translation: “to whom God gave living words” or “to whom God spoke living words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:38	p3xk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγια ζῶντα	1	Stephen is using the term **words** to mean the message that God communicated through words. Alternate translation: “a living message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:38	w2gs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λόγια ζῶντα	1	Stephen is using the term **living** to describe God’s **words** as if they were alive. This could mean: (1) that God’s message is always effective. Alternate translation: “an enduring message” (2) that God’s message shows how to live as God wishes. Alternate translation: “a life-giving message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:39	ab0s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ᾧ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ὑπήκοοι γενέσθαι οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	The word **whom** refers to Moses. It may be helpful to state his name and to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Our fathers were not willing to be obedient to Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:39	mvz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπώσαντο	1	Stephen is speaking to emphasize the Israelites’ rejection of Moses. Alternate translation: “they rejected him as their leader” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:39	z3ze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐστράφησαν ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	Here, **hearts** is a metonym for people’s desires. Alternate translation: “made it their desire to return to Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:40	l8u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπόντες τῷ Ἀαρών, ποίησον ἡμῖν θεοὺς οἳ προπορεύσονται ἡμῶν. ὁ γὰρ Μωϋσῆς οὗτος, ὃς ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, οὐκ οἴδαμεν τί ἐγένετο αὐτῷ.	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “They asked Aaron to make gods for them who would go ahead of them, because they did not know what had happened to Moses, who had brought them from the land of Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:40	kb3o			εἰπόντες τῷ Ἀαρών	1	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They said to Aaron”
7:40	a68q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ὁ γὰρ Μωϋσῆς οὗτος, ὃς ἐξήγαγεν ἡμᾶς ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου, οὐκ οἴδαμεν τί ἐγένετο αὐτῷ	1	It may be more natural to put the information about Moses at the end of the sentence. Alternate translation: “For we do not know what has happened to this Moses who brought us from the land of Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
7:41	ux1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐμοσχοποίησαν	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this **image of a calf** was a statue that the Israelites wanted to worship as an idol. Stephen refers to it as **the idol** later in the sentence. Alternate translation: “they made a statue that looked like a calf to worship as an idol” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:41	v6tx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Stephen is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:41	hjp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐμοσχοποίησαν	1	The pronoun **they** refers back to “our fathers” in verse 39, that is, to the Israelites whom Moses led out of Egypt. Alternate translation: “the Israelites made an image of a calf” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:41	hh77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν	1	Stephen describes what he also calls the **calf** and the **idol** as **the works of their hands** by association with the way the Israelites used their hands to make the calf. Alternate translation: “the statue they had made” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:42	d3dd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔστρεψεν & ὁ Θεὸς	1	Stephen is speaking as if **God** had physically **turned away**. He speaks this way to emphasize that God was not pleased with the Israelites and no longer helped them. Alternate translation: “God stopped helping them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:42	u7lx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	Here, the word **host** means “army,” and the word **heaven** means “sky.” Stephen is speaking of the stars in the sky as if they were an army. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the stars in the sky” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:42	ya6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ τῶν προφητῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the book of the prophets says” or “the book of the prophets records” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:42	f314		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βίβλῳ τῶν προφητῶν	1	This was apparently a collection of the writings of several of the Old Testament prophets on one scroll. Alternate translation: “the scroll that records sayings of the prophets” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:42	w38i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	This is the beginning of a quotation from the prophet Amos, which continues through the end of verse 43. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Amos as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
7:42	o5ly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ?	1	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **did you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Did you offer slain beasts and offerings to me for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
7:42	gd1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ?	1	Speaking through the prophet Amos, God used the question form to emphasize to the people of **Israel** that they did not really worship Him **in the wilderness** with their sacrifices. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You did not honor me when you offered slain beasts and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:42	q9rr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	μὴ & προσηνέγκατέ	1	**You** is plural in these instances, even though the addressee (**house**) is singular, because God is actually speaking to all of the Israelites. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in such a case, you could use singular **you** in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
7:42	tck0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	σφάγια καὶ θυσίας	1	In a figure of speech, God is using the two main categories of sacrifices, those that involve shedding blood (**slain beasts**) and those that are bloodless (**offerings**), to mean sacrifices of all kinds. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “all kinds of sacrifices” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
7:42	j4q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἶκος Ἰσραήλ	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So the **house of Israel** means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “nation of Israel” or “people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:43	zek5			καὶ ἀνελάβετε τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολὸχ, καὶ τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥαιφάν, τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς. καὶ μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐπέκεινα Βαβυλῶνος.	1	The quotation from the prophet Amos continues here.
7:43	h20h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	**And** at the beginning of this verse introduces God’s own answer to the question he asked in the previous verse, [7:42](../07/42.md): “You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me … , did you?” The answer is in contrast to what the question asks. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation, followed by a sentence break: “No!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
7:43	q85n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἀνελάβετε & μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς	1	The term **took up** indicates that the Israelites carried the idols this verse describes around with them as they traveled in the wilderness. The term **remove** in this context means that God will send them into exile as a punishment, with the sense of carrying them away from their homeland. So the punishment is ironic; if possible, use similar terms in your language that will bring out this irony. Alternate translation: “you carried around … I will carry you away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
7:43	gxh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἀνελάβετε & ὑμῶν & ἐποιήσατε & ὑμᾶς	1	As in [7:42](../07/42.md), **you** is plural here, even though the addressee (“house”) is singular, since God is speaking to all of the Israelites. In this verse **your** is also plural. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in these cases, you could use the singular in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
7:43	im7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολὸχ	1	The **tabernacle of Molech** was a tent or shrine that housed an idol of the false god Molech. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:43	cq47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥαιφάν	1	The Israelites were not carrying around an actual **star**, but an image designed to look like a star. This image was used in the worship of the false god Rephan. (This may have been the planet Saturn.) Alternate translation: “the star-shaped image of your god Rephan” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:43	gm4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε	1	The word **images** refers to the idol of Molech and the star-shaped image of Rephan. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You made that idol of Molech and that star-shaped image of Rephan so that you could worship those false gods.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:43	zgq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3	Speaking through Amos, God uses the word translated **and** to introduce what he will do as a result of the Israelites’ unfaithfulness and disobedience. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:43	rrn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐπέκεινα Βαβυλῶνος	1	This is the end of the quotation from the prophet Amos that began in verse 42. See how you marked the beginning of the quotation there. It would be appropriate to mark its ending here with a closing second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation. If you used special formatting to set off the quotation, you could return to regular formatting after this verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
7:44	fs4q			Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nStephen continues his response to the high priest and the council which he began in [Acts 7:2](../07/02.md).

He means that the tabernacle was built **according to the pattern** that Moses saw on Mount Sinai. To make this clear, it may be helpful to supply some of the words that Stephen is leaving out. It may also be helpful to introduce a sentence break. Alternate translation: “The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness. It was built just as the one speaking to Moses had commanded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:44	m9gw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ σκηνὴ τοῦ μαρτυρίου	1	Stephen calls this tent the **tabernacle of the testimony** by association with the way it housed the ark of the covenant, which was also known as the ark of the testimony. The “testimony” of the ark, as UST indicates, was to the covenant between God and the Israelites and to his presence with them wherever they went in the wilderness. Alternate translation: “the tent that housed the ark of the covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:44	fk06		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καθὼς διετάξατο ὁ λαλῶν τῷ Μωϋσῇ, ποιῆσαι αὐτὴν κατὰ τὸν τύπον ὃν ἑωράκει	1	It may be more natural to put the information about the command to Moses before the information about how Moses fulfilled the command. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “The one speaking to Moses had commanded him to make the tabernacle according to the pattern that he had seen, and he made it just that way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
7:44	masq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διετάξατο ὁ λαλῶν τῷ Μωϋσῇ	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is referring to the way God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.

7:45	qjov			διαδεξάμενοι	1	The phrase **having received … in turn** translates a Greek verb that refers to receiving something in succession, in this case from one’s ancestors. Alternate translation: “having received it from their ancestors”
7:45	n2sc			εἰσήγαγον & μετὰ Ἰησοῦ	1	When Stephen says that the Israelites brought in the tabernacle **with Joshua**, he does not mean that they brought in both the tabernacle and Joshua. He means that the Israelites did the things he describes in obedience to Joshua’s directions. Alternate translation: “brought in as Joshua directed them”
7:45	e3gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰσήγαγον	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is referring to the Israelites entering the land of Canaan. Alternate translation: “brought in to the land of Canaan” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:45	eww5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῇ κατασχέσει τῶν ἐθνῶν	1	Stephen is using the term **nations** to mean the land that these people groups occupied. Alternate translation: “when they took possession of land that had been occupied by the nations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:45	spm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	Stephen is using the word **face** to mean “presence.” Alternate translation: “from the presence of our ancestors” or “so that our ancestors alone would live there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:45	zjlj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἕως τῶν ἡμερῶν Δαυείδ	1	Stephen is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “The tabernacle remained there until the days of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:45	wot8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν ἡμερῶν Δαυείδ	1	Stephen is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “the time of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:46	k9vh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εὑρεῖν	1	Stephen is speaking. David did not ask God if he could go look for this **dwelling**. David asked God if he could build it. Alternate translation: “to build” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:46	x4kl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	ὃς εὗρεν χάριν ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The pronoun **who** refers to David. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “David found favor before God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
7:46	ykio		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὃς εὗρεν χάριν ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here the phrase **before God** refers to God’s opinion by association with the way that God would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him.

7:46	w3cu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκήνωμα	1	The word **dwelling** refers to a permanent habitation, that is, a house. Stephen is using the word to mean a temple. He is speaking of this temple as if it was a house in which God lived, since God’s presence was there. Alternate translation: “a house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:46	in7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ	1	Some ancient manuscripts read “the house of Jacob.” ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “the God of Jacob.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
7:46	fsmp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Jacob** means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:47	k54c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτῷ οἶκον	1	Stephen is using the word **house** to mean a temple. Alternate translation: “a temple for him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

7:48	fwvu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	χειροποιήτοις	1	Stephen is using the adjective **made with hands** (or “handmade”) as a noun, to mean structures built by humans. ULT adds **houses** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “temples that people build” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
7:48	c822		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	χειροποιήτοις	1	Stephen is using the word **hand**, one part of a person, to mean the whole person.

7:49	oyax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου	1	This is the beginning of a quotation from the prophet Isaiah, which continues through the end of verse 50. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Isaiah as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
7:49	k2vn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου	1	Speaking through Isaiah, God describes **Heaven** as his **throne** and **the earth** as his **footstool**. If your readers would not understand what these figures mean, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture, or you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. This could mean: (1) that God is present both in heaven and on earth. Alternate translation: “I dwell in heaven, and I am also present throughout the earth” (2) that God rules over heaven and earth. Alternative translation: “I rule from heaven, and I have complete authority over the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:49	i4u3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου	1	God is using the two parts of creation, **Heaven** and **earth**, to mean all of creation.

This could mean: (1) Alternate translation: “I am present everywhere in creation” (2) Alternate translation: “I rule over all of creation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
7:49	wc9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ποῖον οἶκον οἰκοδομήσετέ μοι? λέγει Κύριος, ἢ τίς τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου?	1	God is using the question form to emphasize that human beings cannot build a temple worthy of him or adequate for him. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You can not build a temple that is worthy of me or a place to live that is adequate for me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

God says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one.

7:49	mshp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποῖον οἶκον	1	The word **house** means a “temple.” Alternate translation: “What kind of temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:49	vjaq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **rest**, you could express the same idea in another way.

7:50	hqjr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	οὐχὶ ἡ χείρ μου ἐποίησεν ταῦτα πάντα?	1	This is the end of the quotation from the prophet Isaiah that began in verse 49. See how you marked the beginning of the quotation there. It would be appropriate to mark its ending here with a closing second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation. If you used special formatting to set off the quotation, you could return to regular formatting after this verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
7:50	rfk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἡ χείρ μου ἐποίησεν ταῦτα πάντα?	1	God is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “My hand made all these things!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:50	jlg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οὐχὶ ἡ χείρ μου ἐποίησεν ταῦτα πάντα?	1	God is using one part of himself, his **hand**, to represent all of himself in the act of creating.

7:50	gzw0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα πάντα	1	The phrase **all these things** refers back to “Heaven” and “earth” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “everything in creation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:51	umq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	σκληροτράχηλοι καὶ ἀπερίτμητοι καρδίαις καὶ τοῖς ὠσίν	1	Stephen is using the exclamatory word **O** to make a transition in his speech. Up to this point, he has been identifying with the Sanhedrin members, saying “our fathers” as he describes what earlier generations of Israelites did. Now, as he shifts to rebuking them, he addresses them with the vocative **O**. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for this same purpose. Alternate translation: “You stiff-necked people who are uncircumcised in your heart and ears” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
7:51	yxe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	σκληροτράχηλοι καὶ	1	Stephen is using the adjective **stiff-necked** as a noun, to describe a kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression.

7:51	vn7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκληροτράχηλοι	1	Stephen is speaking of the Sanhedrin members as if they were horses or mules that stiffened their necks in order not to be turned in one direction or another. He means that they are being stubborn. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture, or you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “O stubborn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:51	zp55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀπερίτμητοι καρδίαις καὶ τοῖς ὠσίν	1	Stephen speaks of the Sanhedrin members’ **heart and ears** as **uncircumcised** by association with the way that Gentiles, who are uncircumcised because they are not part of the covenant community, do not obey or listen to God. Alternate translation: “unwilling to obey or listen to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:51	esfc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀπερίτμητοι καρδίαις καὶ τοῖς ὠσίν	1	Stephen is using one part of a person, the **heart**, meaning the desires and will, to represent all of a person in the act of obeying or disobeying.

7:51	w164		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμεῖς & ὑμῶν & ὑμεῖς	1	The words **you** and **your** are plural, since Stephen is speaking to all the members of the Sanhedrin. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
7:51	d2v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ ὑμεῖς	1	Stephen is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “As your ancestors disobeyed God and did not listen to him, so you disobey God and do not listen to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:52	x7kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνα τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν?	1	Stephen is not asking for information. He is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “Your ancestors persecuted each of the prophets!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:52	eiw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τίνα τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν?	1	Stephen’s rhetorical question has an implicit generalization for emphasis.

7:52	q8wb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῦ Δικαίου	1	Stephen is using the adjective **Righteous** as a noun in order to describe a specific person. ULT adds **One** to show this. This is a title that refers to the Christ, the Messiah. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “of the Messiah, who was righteous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
7:52	agd9			οὗ νῦν ὑμεῖς προδόται καὶ φονεῖς ἐγένεσθε	1	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You have now betrayed and murdered him”
7:53	axhl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἵτινες ἐλάβετε	1	The pronoun **who** refers to the Sanhedrin members whom Stephen is addressing. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You received” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:53	t92q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἵτινες ἐλάβετε	1	The Sanhedrin members whom Stephen is addressing did not receive **the law** themselves. Rather, Stephen is using them to represent the entire Jewish community down through the years. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “whose community received” or, if you choose to start a new sentence, “Your community received” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:53	euw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς διαταγὰς ἀγγέλων	1	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is referring to God giving the law to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. A later Jewish tradition said that angels acted as God’s intermediaries at that time. (Stephen says in [7:38](../07/38.md) that an angel was speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as angels delivered it on Mount Sinai” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:54	ef2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀκούοντες & ταῦτα διεπρίοντο ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “these things cut them to their hearts when they heard them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:54	u4l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διεπρίοντο ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	Here, the expression **they were cut to their hearts** is an idiom that means the Sanhedrin members became very angry.

Alternate translation: “they became furious at Stephen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:54	ae9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἔβρυχον τοὺς ὀδόντας ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	This action expressed their strong anger at Stephen.

7:55	zpry		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	Ἰησοῦν ἑστῶτα ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Luke is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate the right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “Jesus standing at the right side of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
7:55	vamz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰησοῦν ἑστῶτα ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor.

Alternate translation: “Jesus, in a place of honor next to God, standing to honor him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
7:56	gzvv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Stephen is using the term **behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say.

7:56	p0jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	θεωρῶ τοὺς οὐρανοὺς διηνοιγμένους, καὶ	1	Stephen is speaking of **the heavens** being **opened** to mean that they are open to his view.

7:56	aqp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus himself used that title to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate the title directly into your language. Alternatively, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could express what it means. Alternate translation: “Jesus the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:56	imoa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκ δεξιῶν ἑστῶτα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you translated the nominal adjective **right** in [7:55](../07/55.md). Alternate translation: “standing at the right side of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

Alternate translation: “shouting loudly to drown out Stephen, they put their hands over their ears to show that they did not want to hear any more” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
7:57	wtwk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κράξαντες & φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1	This is an idiom that suggests that the Sanhedrin members had another, louder voice that they could use. It means that they raised the volume of their voices. Alternate translation: “shouting loudly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:57	hm0q			κράξαντες & φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1	If you would like to reproduce this idiom but it would be unusual in your language to speak as if a whole group of people had one **voice**, you could make this plural. Alternate translation: “with loud voices” or “in loud voices”
7:57	t287			ὥρμησαν ὁμοθυμαδὸν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	This could mean: (1) that the Sanhedrin members all rushed at Stephen at the same time.

7:58	ks1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκβαλόντες ἔξω τῆς πόλεως	1	Luke is likely speaking when he speaks of the Sanhedrin members **throwing** Stephen outside the city. It is unlikely that they actually picked him up and heaved him through the air. Alternate translation: “seizing Stephen and forcefully taking him out of the city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:58	teas		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ μάρτυρες	1	These were the “false witnesses” whom the Sanhedrin brought in to accuse Stephen, as described in [6:13](../06/13.md).

7:58	ryrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέθεντο τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν, παρὰ τοὺς πόδας νεανίου καλουμένου Σαύλου	1	The implications are that the witnesses took off their long robes so that they could throw stones at Stephen more easily and that they left them with Saul for safekeeping. UST models one way to make these implications explicit. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:58	wy7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὰ ἱμάτια	1	These **outer garments** were long cloaks or robes that people wore outside to stay warm. They were also a sign of wealth and status.

Alternate translation: “coats” or “robes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:58	sx2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	παρὰ τοὺς πόδας	1	The expression **at the feet** means on the ground in front of someone.

7:59	fxhz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐπικαλούμενον καὶ λέγοντα	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The phrase **calling out** tells how Stephen was **saying** what he said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “as he was saying loudly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
7:59	k2el		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	δέξαι τὸ πνεῦμά μου	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command.

7:60	u86q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	θεὶς & τὰ γόνατα	1	Kneeling down was an act of submission to God and a reverent posture of prayer. Alternate translation: “after he had knelt down reverently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

7:60	dfjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μὴ στήσῃς αὐτοῖς ταύτην τὴν ἁμαρτίαν	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please do not hold this sin against them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
7:60	tvf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ στήσῃς αὐτοῖς ταύτην τὴν ἁμαρτίαν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **hold … against**. Alternate translation: “forgive them for this sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
7:60	r9vi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ἐκοιμήθη	1	Luke is describing the death of Stephen when he says **he fell asleep**. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant. If this would be misunderstood in your language, use a different polite way of referring to this or use plain language. Alternate translation: “he passed away” or, as in UST, “he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
8:intro	q9d9				0	# Acts 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe story here shifts from Stephen to Saul.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 8:32–33.\n\nThe first sentence of verse 1 ends the description of the events in Chapter 7. Luke begins a new part of his history with the words “And on that day.”\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Receiving the Holy Spirit\n\nIn this chapter Luke speaks for the first time of people receiving the Holy Spirit ([Acts 8:15–19](../08/15.md)). The Holy Spirit had already enabled the believers to speak in tongues, to heal the sick, and to live as a community, and he had filled Stephen. But when the Jews started putting believers in prison, those believers who could leave Jerusalem did leave, and as they went, they told people about Jesus. When the people who heard about Jesus received the Holy Spirit, the church leaders knew that those people had truly become believers.\n\n### Proclaimed\n\nThis chapter, more than any other in the book of Acts, speaks of the believers proclaiming the word, proclaiming the good news, and proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ. The word “proclaim” translates a Greek word that means to tell good news about something.
8:1	ez88		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Σαῦλος δὲ ἦν συνευδοκῶν τῇ ἀναιρέσει αὐτοῦ	1	Luke is providing this background information to help readers understand why Saul was persecuting the church, as he relates in [8:3](../08/03.md) and in Chapter 9.

8:1	vc8x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	Here, **day** is not a figurative word for “time.” Luke is referring to a specific day, the day on which Stephen was killed.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
8:2	sjc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνεκόμισαν & τὸν Στέφανον	1	The word translated **carried away** means to carry away for burial. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. You could also say explicitly that it was Stephen’s body that these men carried away.

8:3	yd2i			κατὰ τοὺς οἴκους	1	Alternate translation: “entering one house after another”

Alternate translation: “the believers who had been scattered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
8:4	ymy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ & διασπαρέντες	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could state this in active form.

8:5	f45b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν πόλιν τῆς Σαμαρείας	1	This is an idiom that means the principal city in the region of Samaria, probably the one known at that time as Sebaste, although some interpreters believe that Luke may have had the city of Sychar in mind instead. Alternate translation: “the main city in Samaria” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:5	pk1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν Χριστόν	1	Luke is using the name **Christ** by association to mean the message about Christ. Alternate translation: “the good news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

8:6	tt0i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῖς λεγομένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ Φιλίππου	1	Luke is using the participle **being spoken**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun. ULT adds the term **things** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the things that Philip was saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
8:6	g0ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῖς λεγομένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ Φιλίππου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the things that Philip was saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:6	wm83			τὰ σημεῖα	1	Here the word **signs** has the same sense that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and elsewhere in Acts. It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “the miracles”
8:7	un6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	πολλοὶ γὰρ τῶν ἐχόντων πνεύματα ἀκάθαρτα, βοῶντα φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, ἐξήρχοντο	1	As Luke tells the story of this event, he changes from the people who had **unclean spirits** being the subject of the sentence to the **unclean spirits** themselves being the subject. This may be because the unclean spirits controlled people to such an extent that the spirits seemed to be the people themselves. It may be helpful to your readers to put the information about the spirits before the information about the people who had them. Alternate translation: “unclean spirits, shouting with a loud voice, were coming out of many of those who had them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

If you must state who did the action, it would be appropriate to say Jesus, since the book of Acts shows that the apostles healed people in the name of Jesus, for example, in [4:10](../04/10.md). Alternate translation: “Jesus, through the power of his name, healed many who had been paralyzed and lame” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:7	imbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὶ & παραλελυμένοι	1	Luke is using the participle **paralyzed** as an adjective. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

8:8	r0nz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐγένετο & πολλὴ χαρὰ ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the same idea in another way.

8:9	jm7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἀνὴρ δέ τις ὀνόματι Σίμων, προϋπῆρχεν ἐν τῇ πόλει μαγεύων	1	Luke is providing background information to help readers understand who Simon was and why he said and did the things Luke describes in the rest of this chapter.

8:9	cx7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σίμων	1	**Simon** is the name of a man. See how you translated this name, for a different man, in [1:13](../01/13.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:10	mvcm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ᾧ προσεῖχον πάντες ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου	1	The phrase **to whom** refers to Simon. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here.

8:10	ibl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου	1	Luke is speaking, using these two extremes in order to include all of the people in between.

8:10	j3d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ἡ Δύναμις τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἡ καλουμένη Μεγάλη	1	The Samaritans believed that Simon must be the embodiment of some great power, and thinking that this power was God, the highest of powers, they called it Great. Alternate translation: “an embodiment of the Great God” or “an embodiment of the supreme God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:10	yw5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ καλουμένη	1	If your language does not use the passive form **called**, you could state this in active form. Alternate translation: “that people call” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

8:12	jg1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	εὐαγγελιζομένῳ περὶ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ ὀνόματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Since Jesus inaugurated the **kingdom of God** when he came to earth, it may be helpful to put the information about Jesus before the information about the kingdom of God.

8:13	rnr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	θεωρῶν τε σημεῖα καὶ δυνάμεις μεγάλας	1	The word that ULT translates as **works** here is the same word that it translates as “power” in [8:10](../08/10.md). It can mean either power or works that demonstrate power. Luke is using the word to show what an ironic situation Simon is in. He claimed to be “the power … that is called Great,” but now he recognizes that **works** of power that are truly **great** are done in the name of Jesus. If your language has a word for works that demonstrate power that has the same root as its word for power, it would be appropriate to use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
8:13	d4yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τε σημεῖα καὶ δυνάμεις	1	The terms **signs** and **works** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation, as in UST: “miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

8:14	lk9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἀκούσαντες & ὅτι δέδεκται ἡ Σαμάρεια τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀπέστειλαν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “having heard, ‘Samaria has received the word of God,’ sent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
8:14	uwxo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἀκούσαντες & ὅτι δέδεκται ἡ Σαμάρεια τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀπέστειλαν	1	If you decide to have a direct quotation here, you might also decide to make it an exclamation.

8:15	af1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἵτινες καταβάντες, προσηύξαντο περὶ αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **who** stands for Peter and John, and the pronoun **them** stands for the Samaritans. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “When Peter and John had come down, they prayed for the Samaritans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:15	hd1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	οἵτινες	1	Since the pronoun **who** stands for two men, it should be in the dual if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
8:15	hk1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καταβάντες	1	Luke speaks of Philip **having come down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “having traveled from Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:15	bun9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	καταβάντες	1	Your language may say “gone” rather than **come** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having gone down” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
8:16	d2z9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐδέπω & ἦν ἐπ’ οὐδενὶ αὐτῶν ἐπιπεπτωκός	1	Luke is speaking of the Holy Spirit as if it could fall on the Samaritan believers. Alternate translation: “none of them had yet received the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:16	l4ez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Luke is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why Peter and John had to pray for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “They prayed for them because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:16	qmjp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδέπω & ἦν ἐπ’ οὐδενὶ αὐτῶν ἐπιπεπτωκός	1	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “he had not yet fallen upon none of them.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
8:16	bpzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐδέπω & ἦν & ἐπιπεπτωκός	1	The pronoun **he** stands for the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

8:16	m1nw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μόνον & βεβαπτισμένοι ὑπῆρχον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could state this in active form.

8:17	bldf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ἐπετίθεσαν	1	Since this instance of the pronoun **they** stands for two men, it should be in the dual if your language uses that form. The same is true of “them” in [8:18](../08/18.md) and “they” and “the ones” in [8:25](../08/25.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
8:17	q7gd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπετίθεσαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	Peter and John **laying their hands** on the Samaritans who had believed Philip’s message of the gospel was a symbolic action that showed that Peter and John wanted God to give the Holy Spirit to these believers. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
8:18	rh79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δίδοται τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is clear from the context that this was God. Alternate translation: “God was giving the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:19	fbw9			δότε κἀμοὶ τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην, ἵνα ᾧ ἐὰν ἐπιθῶ τὰς χεῖρας, λαμβάνῃ Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον	1	Alternate translation: “Give me the authority to give the Holy Spirit to anyone I lay my hands on”

You may want to use an exclamation to convey this same emphasis in your language. Alternate translation: “I refuse your offer! I can see that you are going to perdition, and you can take your money with you!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
8:20	y4ny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ἀργύριόν	1	Peter is referring to money by association with the way that **silver** was used for money at this time. Alternate translation: “money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:20	gh12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν δωρεὰν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Peter is referring to the ability to confer the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands. Since this is an ability that only God can give, by association Peter calls it **the gift of God**. Alternate translation: “the power to confer the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:21	p2ev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	οὐκ ἔστιν σοι μερὶς οὐδὲ κλῆρος ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1	The terms **part** and **share** mean similar things. Peter is using them together for emphasis.

8:21	ufk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	σοι	1	The phrase **to you** represents a possessive form. Alternate translation: “yours” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
8:21	xbh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ γὰρ καρδία σου οὐκ ἔστιν εὐθεῖα	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “your thoughts and motives are not right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:21	p9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This could mean: (1) that Simon’s **heart** is not **right** in God’s opinion by association with the way that God would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “as far as God is concerned” (2) that Simon does not have the right thoughts about God or intentions towards God. Alternate translation: “in its attitude towards God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:22	sa6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ τῆς κακίας σου ταύτης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wickedness**, you could express the same idea in another way.

8:22	ppk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ἐπίνοια τῆς καρδίας σου	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “what you intended to do” or “what you were thinking of doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:22	pe2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	δεήθητι τοῦ Κυρίου, εἰ ἄρα ἀφεθήσεταί σοι ἡ ἐπίνοια τῆς καρδίας σου	1	Peter is using the conditional word **if** to introduce a desired result. There is actually no doubt about whether God will forgive someone who sincerely repents and prays for forgiveness. Alternate translation: “pray to the Lord so that, as a result, the intention of your heart will be forgiven to you” or “pray to the Lord and ask him to forgive you for the intention of your heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])

8:23	tf3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εἰς & χολὴν πικρίας	1	The **gall** plant has a bitter taste and is poisonous. If your readers would not be familiar with this plant, you could use the name of a similar plant in your area. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:23	kpu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς & χολὴν πικρίας	1	Peter is using the **gall** plant by association to mean “poison.” Alternate translation: “in the poison of bitterness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:23	d3v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς & χολὴν πικρίας	1	Peter is describing **bitterness** as if it were made of **gall** or poison. He means that bitterness, here in the sense of envy, spiritually poisons a person, that is, it leads them towards spiritual death. Alternate translation: “dangerously envious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:23	j696		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας	1	Peter speaks of **the bond of unrighteousness** as if unrighteousness were restraining Simon and keeping him a prisoner. He means Simon is not able to stop himself from sinning. Alternate translation: “unable to stop sinning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:24	n5cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ὑμεῖς & εἰρήκατε	1	Even though it was only Peter who spoke to Simon, in his response, Simon is addressing both Peter and John, since he offered money to both of them, as [8:18](../08/18.md) describes. Since Simon is speaking to two men, **You** and **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise it would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
8:24	v2wy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	δεήθητε ὑμεῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ πρὸς τὸν Κύριον	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please pray to the Lord for me” or “I ask you to pray to the Lord for me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
8:24	hwc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	δεήθητε ὑμεῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ πρὸς τὸν Κύριον	1	Simon is stating the pronoun **You**, which is already implied in the verb **pray**, for emphasis. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “Pray to the Lord for me yourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:24	u1a4			ὅπως μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε	1	Alternate translation: “so that the things you have said may not happen to me”
8:24	sk5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε	1	Simon is referring implicitly to Peter’s rebuke, in which Peter spoke of Simon’s silver perishing along with him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I will not perish as you said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:25	nzvg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	οὖν	1	Luke is using the word translated **Then** to introduce what Peter and John did after being in the city where Philip had been telling the Samaritans about Jesus. Alternate translation: “After that,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
8:25	p3rj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ & διαμαρτυράμενοι καὶ λαλήσαντες τὸν λόγον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	The **ones** Luke is describing are Peter and John. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Peter and John, after they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:25	uz15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ & διαμαρτυράμενοι καὶ λαλήσαντες	1	Luke is using the participles **having testified** and **having spoken**, which function as adjectives, as nouns. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the ones who had testified and spoken” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
8:25	ww9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that Peter and John shared by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:25	eu66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πολλάς & κώμας τῶν Σαμαρειτῶν	1	The term **villages** refers by association to the people who lived in these villages. Alternate translation: “to the people in many Samaritan villages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:26	mbj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:26	w1nk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνάστηθι	1	Here the word **arise** means that the angel wanted Philip to take action, not that the angel wanted him to stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “Pack for a journey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:26	le2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν καταβαίνουσαν ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλὴμ εἰς Γάζαν	1	The angel speaks of the road **going down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:26	a18y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	αὕτη ἐστὶν ἔρημος	1	This sentence could be: (1) something that Luke adds to provide background information about the area through which Philip would be travelling. Alternate translation: “from Jerusalem to Gaza.’ (Now that road leads through a desert.)” (2) part of what the angel is saying to Philip. Alternate translation: “from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is a desert road.’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
8:27	s0yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς, ἐπορεύθη	1	As in the previous verse, the word **arising** means that Philip took preparatory action, not that he stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “he prepared for a journey and left” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:27	xy7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke is using the word **behold** to alert his audience to a new person in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
8:27	zkc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἀνὴρ, Αἰθίοψ εὐνοῦχος, δυνάστης Κανδάκης βασιλίσσης Αἰθιόπων, ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς γάζης αὐτῆς, ὃς ἐληλύθει προσκυνήσων εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	This verse provides background information about this Ethiopian official and why he was travelling along this road. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence and to use a natural form for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “a man from Ethiopia. Now this man was a eunuch, an official of the Kandake, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, and he had come to Jerusalem to worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
8:27	i5zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνὴρ, Αἰθίοψ	1	This is an idiomatic way of describing someone. Alternate translation: “a man from Ethiopia” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:27	s1uf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εὐνοῦχος, δυνάστης Κανδάκης	1	While the word **eunuch** describes a man who has been castrated, as men sometimes were who served in royal courts in the ancient world, the emphasis here is on the fact that this man was a high government official, not on his physical state. Alternate translation: “an important official in the court of the Kandake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:27	t5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Κανδάκης	1	**Kandake** was a title for the queens of Ethiopia. It is similar to the word Pharaoh, the title that was used for the kings of Egypt. So in your translation, make clear that it is a title rather than a name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:27	nm48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς γάζης αὐτῆς	1	Luke is using a spatial metaphor when says that this man was **over** the **treasure** of the Kandake. He means that the man was responsible for it. Alternate translation: “who was in charge of her treasury” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:27	v8q7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃς ἐληλύθει προσκυνήσων εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	The implication is that this man was a Gentile who believed in the true God and had come to worship at the Jewish temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Even though he was a Gentile, he had come to worship the true God at the temple in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:27	uk32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ὃς ἐληλύθει	1	Your language may say “gone” rather than **come** in a context such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “who had gone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
8:28	d3kv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῦ ἅρματος	1	Here and in [8:29](../08/29.md) and [8:38](../08/38.md), the term **chariot** probably means something like “carriage.” Chariots were vehicles for war, not for long-distance travel, and people stood to ride in chariots, while this man was seated. Alternate translation, as in UST: “his carriage” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:28	bx2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀνεγίνωσκεν τὸν προφήτην Ἠσαΐαν	1	Luke is using the phrase **the prophet Isaiah** to mean the prophecies that Isaiah spoke and recorded. Alternate translation: “he was reading from the book of Isaiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:28	n40c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνεγίνωσκεν	1	Since Philip was able to hear what the man was reading, as [8:30](../08/30.md) explains, the implication is that the man was reading aloud. Alternate translation: “he was reading aloud from” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:29	llh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πρόσελθε καὶ κολλήθητι τῷ ἅρματι τούτῳ	1	The Spirit means that Philip is to stay close to the person riding in the **chariot**. Alternate translation: “Go over to that chariot so you can be near the man in it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:30	ffh7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀναγινώσκοντος Ἠσαΐαν τὸν προφήτην	1	Luke is using the phrase **Isaiah the prophet** to mean the prophecies that Isaiah spoke and recorded. Alternate translation: “reading from the book of Isaiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:30	x98i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἆρά γε γινώσκεις ἃ ἀναγινώσκεις	1	The Ethiopian was a literate, educated man who could read, but he lacked spiritual discernment. Philip is asking implicitly whether he understands the meaning of the passage from Isaiah. Alternate translation: “Do you understand the meaning of what you are reading?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:31	r5g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς γὰρ ἂν δυναίμην ἐὰν μή τις ὁδηγήσει με?	1	The man is not asking for information. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No, I cannot understand unless someone guides me.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:31	zx9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρεκάλεσέν & τὸν Φίλιππον, ἀναβάντα καθίσαι σὺν αὐτῷ	1	The implication is that when the man invited Philip to come up and sit with him, Philip agreed to travel down the road with him to explain the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “he invited Philip to come up and sit with him and explain the Scriptures, and Philip accepted the invitation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:32	nd93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη	1	This a quotation from Isaiah [53:7–8](../isa/53/07.md). It describes the Messiah, whom Isaiah calls “the servant of the Lord.” But since the Ethiopian official did not know whom Isaiah was describing and had to ask Philip, it would be better not to specify that at this point by saying, for example, “The Messiah was led like a sheep to the slaugher” or “The servant of the Lord was led like a sheep to the slaughter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:32	bgk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **slaughter**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “He was led like a sheep that was going to be slaughtered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:32	kh97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤχθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “People led him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:32	lu3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐναντίον τοῦ κείραντος αὐτὸν ἄφωνος	1	A **shearer** is a person who cuts the wool off the sheep so that it may be used. If your readers would not be familiar with this word and you have no comparable word in your language, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “is silent while its wool is being cut off” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:32	k8sy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1	This means that the Messiah does not speak by association with the way a person would **open his mouth** in order to speak. Alternate translation: “he says nothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:33	dwur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει, ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **humiliation** and **justice**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “Because he acted humbly and did not defend himself, his enemies were able to treat him unjustly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:33	y2a1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “his enemies denied him justice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:33	k3uz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1	Isaiah is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No one will describe his generation.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:33	ec09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1	Isaiah is using a future statement to describe capability. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use form that is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Who can describe his generation?” or “No one will be able to describe his generation.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
8:33	yxxn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **generation**, you could express the same idea in another way. This could mean: (1) that no one will be able to describe the Messiah’s descendants because he will die without having any children. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to describe his descendants.” (2) that no one will be able to describe the other people living at the same time as the Messiah because they will be so wicked. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to describe how wicked his contemporaries are.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:33	idk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αἴρεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡ ζωὴ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “his enemies will take his life from the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:34	agq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ εὐνοῦχος τῷ Φιλίππῳ εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the Ethiopian official responded to Philip’s question about whether he understood what he was reading. Alternate translation: “The eunuch responded to Philip’s question by saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
8:34	htb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δέομαί σου	1	The Ethiopian official is using a polite, idiomatic expression. Alternate translation: “Please tell me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:34	pa3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἑτέρου τινός	1	In this context, the pronoun **other** means “other person.” Alternate translation: “some other person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:35	j7xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀνοίξας & τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1	By association with the way a person would be **opening his mouth** in order to speak, this means that Philip spoke. The image of the open mouth suggests a certain confidence and freedom in speaking. Alternate translation: “speaking confidently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:35	uw21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς Γραφῆς ταύτης	1	By **this scripture**, Luke implicitly means the passage that the official had been reading. Alternate translation: “the passage from Isaiah that the official had been reading” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:35	xg4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εὐηγγελίσατο αὐτῷ τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	Luke is using the name **Jesus** by association to mean the message about Jesus. Alternate translation: “the good news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:36	ip13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τι ὕδωρ & ὕδωρ	1	Luke and the official are using the word **water** to mean a body of water, such as a pool at a desert oasis. Alternate translation: “a pool of water … there is a pool of water” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:36	muz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί κωλύει με βαπτισθῆναι?	1	This question could be: (1) a rhetorical question that the eunuch is using as a polite way to ask Philip to baptize him. Alternate translation: “Please allow me to be baptized.” (2) a genuine request for information, since Philip seems to answer this question in [8:37](../08/37.md) by identifying something that could keep the official from being baptized. Alternate translation: “Is there a condition I must meet in order to be baptized?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:36	wb9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	με βαπτισθῆναι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you from baptizing me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:37	ov75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Φίλιππος ἐὰν πιστεύεις ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου σωθήσει; ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ εἶπεν Πιστεύω εἰς τὸν Χριστὸν τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ	1	As the General Introduction to Acts explains, this verse is found in many traditional versions of the Bible, but it is not found in the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. ULT and UST indicate this by putting the verse in brackets. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider including this verse if that translation does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that this verse may not be original, such as by putting it in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
8:37	qj5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐὰν πιστεύεις ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and intentions. Alternate translation: “If you genuinely believe in Jesus and want to be his disciple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:37	djq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σωθήσει	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God will save you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:37	e3uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς & εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the eunuch responded to what Philip told him. Alternate translation: “the eunuch responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
8:38	l8wl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκέλευσεν στῆναι τὸ ἅρμα	1	Luke is using the term **chariot** by association to mean the driver of the chariot. Alternate translation: “the official told the driver of the chariot to stop” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:38	nn00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐβάπτισεν αὐτόν	1	The pronoun **he** stands for Philip, and the pronoun **him** stands for the eunuch. Alternate translation: “Philip baptized the eunuch” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:39	xp52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	γὰρ	1	While the word translated **for** often introduces a reason, that does not seem to be its function here. Luke is not saying that the eunuch did not see Philip anymore because he did not look for him but instead **went on his way**. Rather, the word **for** seems simply to introduce a continuation of the narrative. Alternate translation: “but” or “nevertheless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
8:40	r1x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Φίλιππος & εὑρέθη εἰς Ἄζωτον	1	The implication is that there was no indication of Philip traveling between where he baptized the Ethiopian and Azotus. He suddenly disappeared along the road to Gaza and reappeared at the town of Azotus. Alternate translation: “Philip suddenly reappeared at Azotus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:40	bbws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Φίλιππος & εὑρέθη εἰς Ἄζωτον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Philip reappeared at Azotus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:40	arh5			διερχόμενος	1	Alternate translation: “as he passed through that area, he was”
8:40	zfn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὰς πόλεις πάσας	1	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “to the cities in that region” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
8:40	yf7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἄζωτον & Καισάρειαν	1	**Azotus** and **Caesarea** are the names of cities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
9:intro	jm6x				0	# Acts 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn [9:1](../09/01.md), the story shifts back to Saul and tells about his salvation.\n\nIn [9:32](../09/32.md), the story shifts from Saul to a new part of the story about Peter.\n\nActs [9:31](../09/31.md) is a summary statement that Luke uses to mark the transition into the third major part of the book.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Letters for the synagogues in Damascus”\n\nThe “letters” Paul asked for in 9:2 were probably legal papers that permitted him to put Christians in prison. The synagogue leaders in Damascus would have obeyed the letter because it was written by the high priest. If the Romans had seen the letter, they also would have allowed Saul to persecute the Christians, because they permitted the Jews to do as they desired to people who broke their religious laws.\n\n### “The Way”\n\nNo one knows for sure who first started calling the community of Jesus’ followers “the Way.” This may be what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or “way.” If this is true, the believers were “following the way of the Lord” by living in a way that pleased God. However, in the book of Acts the term is only used by outsiders, as in 9:2, or by believers speaking to outsiders. So it could also be a term by which the community of Jesus’ followers was known outside that community.\n\n### “the church”\n\nActs 9:31 is the first use of the word **church** in the singular to refer to more than one local congregation. In that verse it refers to all the believers in all the groups throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria. It shows that they recognized that they all had a common identity as followers of Jesus.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “the Lord”\n\nLuke refers to Jesus by a respectful title, “the Lord,” in verses 1, 10, 11, 15, 27, 28, 31, 35, and 42, and Ananias refers to Jesus the same way in verse 17. In your translation, you may wish to clarify that this means “the Lord Jesus.” Or you could state “Jesus,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### What Saul saw when he met Jesus\n\nIt is clear that Saul saw a light and that it was because of this light that he “fell upon the ground.” Some people think that Saul knew that it was the Lord speaking to him without seeing a human form, because the Bible often speaks of God as being light and living in light. Other people think that later in his life he was able to say, “I have seen the Lord Jesus” because it was a human form that he saw here.
9:1	r4n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word translated **But** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
9:1	anb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐμπνέων ἀπειλῆς καὶ φόνου εἰς	1	Luke is using the two words **threat** and **murder** together to express a single idea. The word **murder** tells what kind of **threat** Saul was making. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “making murderous threats against” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
9:1	lrre		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐμπνέων	1	Luke is using the term **breathing** by association to mean “speaking,” since people breathe out while they speak. Alternate translation: “speaking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:2	wyfp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ & εὕρῃ & ἀγάγῃ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to the high priest and both instances of the pronoun **he** refer to Saul. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
9:2	zu6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπιστολὰς	1	See the General Notes to this chapter for an explanation of what these **letters** were. This may help you decide what word in your language to use for them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
9:2	v9lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς Δαμασκὸν πρὸς τὰς συναγωγάς	1	Luke is using the terms **Damascus** and **synagogues** by association to mean the people, probably the leaders, of the synagogues in Damascus. Alternate translation: “to the people in the synagogues of Damascus” or “to the leaders of the synagogues in Damascus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:2	thuy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῆς ὁδοῦ, ὄντας	1	As the General Notes to this chapter explain, **the Way** was one of the first names that people used to describe the community of believers in Jesus.

9:5	jaq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	τίς εἶ, κύριε?	1	Saul is not yet acknowledging that Jesus is **Lord**.

9:10	vqh0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	ὁ Κύριος	1	Here and throughout this chapter, **the Lord** is a respectful title that Luke is using to refer to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])

If there is a comparable symbolic action in your culture, you could use that in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “giving him a spiritual blessing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
9:13	quxn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ πολλῶν	1	Ananias is using the adjective **many** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people.

9:15	uq9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱῶν & Ἰσραήλ	1	The Lord is using the word **sons** to mean “descendants.” He is speaking of the Israelites, who were descendants of the patriarch Jacob, also known as Israel.

9:17	my6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπιθεὶς ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὰς χεῖρας	1	When Ananias **laid his hands** on Saul, this was a symbolic way of giving him a blessing.

9:17	a89q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅπως ἀναβλέψῃς καὶ πλησθῇς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	If your language does not use the passive form **filled**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “so that you might see again and that the Holy Spirit might fill you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:17	x4ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλησθῇς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	Ananias is speaking as if Saul were a container that the Holy Spirit could fill. Alternate translation: “receive the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “This is the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who call on this name! And he come here for this, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
9:21	ctg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο	1	By **this name** the speakers implicitly mean the name of Jesus. Alternate translation: “the ones calling on the name of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “that he might bind them and bring them to the chief priests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:21	pnrp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἵνα δεδεμένους, αὐτοὺς ἀγάγῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς	1	Like Ananias in [9:14](../09/14.md), the people here are using one part of the arrest process to represent the entire process.

They became agitated because they could not find a way to refute Saul’s arguments that Jesus was the Messiah. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As he proved that Jesus is the Christ, the Jews living in Damascus became agitated” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:23	cg9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὡς & ἐπληροῦντο ἡμέραι ἱκαναί	1	As in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [7:23](../07/23.md), this is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after many days” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
9:23	nyh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς & ἐπληροῦντο ἡμέραι ἱκαναί	1	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” but use an active verbal form instead of the passive form here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.

In that case it may be helpful to move this information to the end of the verse, as UST does. (2) that someone told Saul about the plot, but even so, he was not able to flee for his life, because the gates were being watched. In that case you could change the second instance of **But** in the verse to “However.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
9:24	lv62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγνώσθη δὲ τῷ Σαύλῳ ἡ ἐπιβουλὴ αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural and meaningful in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

9:38	pukn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	παρακαλοῦντες	1	Since two men are speaking, if your language marks participles for number, **urging** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise it would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
9:39	k1se		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς & Πέτρος συνῆλθεν αὐτοῖς	1	Here the word **arising** means that Peter took action in order to be able to make the trip with these men, not that he got up from a sitting or lying position.

9:39	tdrr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς	1	This first instance of **them** in the verse would be dual if your language uses that form, since it applies to two men. The second instance of **them** would be plural, since it refers to the group of widows. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
9:39	me79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσαι αἱ χῆραι	1	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “a large crowd of widows” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

When she was alive, Dorcas used to make many of these to help the widows because they were poor and could not afford clothes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:39	y6q5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	μετ’ αὐτῶν οὖσα	1	This may be a delicate way of speaking about Dorcas’s death, rather than saying “before she died.” Alternate translation, as in UST: “while she was still alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

The widows were likely also believers, but Luke mentions them specifically because Tabitha was so important to them. To show this, it may be helpful to put the information about the widows before the information about the believers. Alternate translation: “the widows and the other believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
9:41	ex8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοὺς ἁγίους	1	Luke is using the term **saints** by association to mean believers in Jesus. See how you translated the term in [9:33](../09/33.md). Alternate translation: “the other believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

10:intro	ym7z				0	# Acts 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1–2 give background information about Cornelius. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence at the start of v. 2. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n- In verse 9, the story shifts away from Cornelius and tells how God prepared Peter to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.\n- In verse 24, the story brings Peter and Cornelius together.\n\n- The long sentence in verses 36–38 can be broken up into several sentences, as in the UST.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jews visiting with Gentiles\n\nThe Jews believed that they would become unclean in God’s sight if they visited or ate food with a Gentile. This was because the Pharisees had made a law against this, wanting to keep Jews from eating foods that the law of Moses said were unclean. The law of Moses did say that some foods were unclean, but it did not say that Jewish people could not visit or eat with Gentiles. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Baptism and the Holy Spirit\n\nThose who were listening to Peter received the Holy Spirit even as he was speaking to them. This showed the Jewish believers that Gentiles could believe the word of God and receive the Holy Spirit just as the Jewish believers had. After that, the Gentiles were baptized.

10:3	up3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὥραν ἐνάτην	1	This was the normal afternoon prayer time for Jews. Cornelius, as a Gentile who worshiped the God of Israel, would have praying at this time. Alternate translation: “during his afternoon prayer time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

10:12	ua3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	From Peter’s response in [10:14](../10/14.md), the implication is that the law of Moses commanded the Jews not to eat some of the creatures in the container.

11:intro	hva5				0	# Acts 11 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “The Gentiles also had received the word of God”\n\nAlmost all of the first believers were Jewish. Luke writes in this chapter that many Gentiles started to believe in Jesus. They believed that the message about Jesus was true and so began to “receive the word of God.” Some of the believers in Jerusalem did not believe that Gentiles could truly follow Jesus, so Peter went to them and told them what had happened to him and how he had seen the Gentiles receive the Word of God and receive the Holy Spirit.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “the Lord”\n\nIn verse 16, Peter refers to Jesus by a respectful title, “the Lord.” Luke refers to Jesus the same way in the second instance of the phrase in verse 21 and in verses 23 and 24. In your translation, you may wish to clarify that this means “the Lord Jesus.” Or you could state “Jesus,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Peter’s summary of his visit to Cornelius\n\nIn Acts 11:5–17, Peter summarizes the events that are described in greater detail in 10:9–47. Very similar language is used throughout both passages. As you translate 11:5–17, in order to ensure that your translation is consistent, compare how you translated specific terms and phrases in 10:9–47.
11:1	ab75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

11:2	yar6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	As in [10:45](../10/45.md), Luke is using the term **circumcision** by association to identify as Jewish these believers who disputed with Peter. They were likely to have been strictly observant Jews who followed the teaching of the Pharisees about Jews visiting with Gentiles. See the discussion of this in the General Notes to Chapter 10.

11:6	lbh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	From Peter’s response in [11:8](../11/08.md), the implication is that the law of Moses commanded the Jews not to eat some of the creatures in the container.

11:7	ag7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστάς	1	Here the term **arising** means that the voice wanted Peter to take action, not that the voice wanted him to stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation, as in UST: “Go ahead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

11:8	m4mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	μηδαμῶς	1	**By no means** is an exclamation that communicates a strong refusal to do or even to consider something. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. See how you translated this in [10:14](../10/14.md). Alternate translation: “No, never” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

11:8	m5p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον οὐδέποτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου	1	The implication is that some the animals in the container were forbidden for Jews to eat. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the common or unclean, like some of those animals, has never entered into my mouth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:8	wwbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον οὐδέποτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the word **never** and the negative terms **common** and **unclean**. Alternate translation: “only what is holy and clean has ever entered into my mouth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
11:8	j0rv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον οὐδέποτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου	1	Peter is using one part of the eating process to represent the entire process.

11:9	at0t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ, ἃ ὁ Θεὸς ἐκαθάρισεν, σὺ μὴ κοίνου	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “from heaven and told me that I must not make common what God had cleansed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
11:9	b24j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἃ ὁ Θεὸς ἐκαθάρισεν	1	If God is the speaker, he is referring to himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person in your translation. Alternate translation: “What I, God, have cleansed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
11:9	txbl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	σὺ μὴ κοίνου	1	The voice is adding the pronoun **you** for emphasis. If your language does not ordinarily use a pronoun with the imperative but can do so for emphasis, it would be appropriate to do that here. You could also express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you must not make common” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
11:10	xrq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτο & ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τρίς	1	This could mean: (1) that the voice told Peter three times to kill and eat, Peter refused three times, and each time the voice told him not to call unclean what God had cleansed. Alternate translation: “Peter had this exchange with the voice three times” (2) that after Peter first refused, the voice said to him three times, “What God has cleansed, you must not make common.” Alternate translation: “the voice said this three times” See how you translated this in [10:16](../10/16.md).

11:11	ias8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἦμεν	1	The term **we** refers to Peter and the others in the house in Joppa. It does not include his current audience in Jerusalem.

11:14	fnjz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σὲ & σωθήσῃ σὺ & σου	1	All the instances of the words **you** and **your** in this verse are singular, since they refer to Cornelius. So use the singular forms of those word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
11:14	p3gk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σωθήσῃ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It is clear from the context that God will do the action. Alternate translation, as in UST: “God will save you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

11:15	qy12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ὥσπερ καὶ ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς	1	Here the word **us** refers to Peter himself and to the believers to whom he is speaking in Jerusalem, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
11:15	th4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἀρχῇ	1	By **in the beginning**, Peter means the day of Pentecost. Alternate translation: “on the day of Pentecost” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

11:16	v116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑμεῖς & βαπτισθήσεσθε	1	You may wish to retain the metaphor of baptism in your translation. If you do, if it would be clearer in your language, you could state this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action.

11:17	pe42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	Here the word **us** refers to Peter himself and to the believers to whom he is speaking in Jerusalem, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

11:17	xpsl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐγὼ τίς ἤμην δυνατὸς κωλῦσαι τὸν Θεόν	1	For emphasis, Peter is adding the pronoun **I**, which is not required with the verb. If your language does not ordinarily use a pronoun with verbs but can do so for emphasis, it would be appropriate to do that here. You could also express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I certainly could not hinder God!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
11:17	ot1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κωλῦσαι τὸν Θεόν	1	It may be helpful to indicate in what way Peter thought he might be able to **hinder** God.

11:19	whm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ & διασπαρέντες ἀπὸ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. This is a reference to the **persecution** that Luke describes in [8:1](../08/01.md), which began after the trial and death of Stephen. See how you translated the similar expression in that verse.

11:19	c8ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	μηδενὶ λαλοῦντες τὸν λόγον εἰ μὴ μόνον Ἰουδαίοις	1	Since Luke says here that the scattered believers spoke about Jesus **only to Jews**, but he says in the next verse that some of them spoke to “Greeks” (that is, Gentiles), it might appear in your language that Luke was contradicting himself. If so, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Most of them believed they should speak the message about Jesus only to Jews, so that is what they did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])

11:21	ebxq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	χεὶρ Κυρίου	1	In this instance, Luke seems to mean God the Father when he says **the Lord**. In [4:29–30](../04/29.md), the believers pray, “Lord … stretch out your hand to heal and for signs and wonders to happen through the name of your holy Servant Jesus.” Luke seems to be describing these events as part of the answer to that prayer. Alternate translation: “the hand of God the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
11:21	aj5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	χεὶρ	1	Here, the **hand** represents power, since hands give people the capability to do things. Alternate translation: “the power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “became disciples of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:21	qcn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	ἐπὶ τὸν Κύριον	1	In this instance, Luke is referring to Jesus by a respectful title, as the General Notes to this chapter discuss.

11:22	rdhr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean a report about the Gentile believers in Antioch. Alternate translation: “a report” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

12:2	r1zv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀνεῖλεν & Ἰάκωβον	1	It was probably not Herod himself who **killed James**. Rather, he most likely ordered his soldiers to do this. Alternate translation: “he ordered his soldiers to execute James” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
12:3	v4ag		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις	1	Luke is using the name of a whole group, **the Jews**, to refer to one part of that group, its leaders. Alternate translation: “to the leaders of the Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
12:3	ly66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ἡμέραι τῶν Ἀζύμων	1	The phrase **Unleavened Bread** is the name of a Jewish religious observance that took place over several **days**.

12:4	pps1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τέσσαρσιν τετραδίοις στρατιωτῶν	1	These **quaternions** were groups of four **soldiers** each. They would have taken turns guarding Peter in six-hour shifts throughout the day and night. Two soldiers would have been at Peter’s side and the other two soldiers by the entrance.

It means to put someone on trial, and the implications, based on the fact that Herod saw that it pleased the Jewish leaders when he executed James, are that Herod planned to execute Peter after this trial.

12:13	pfn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κρούσαντος & αὐτοῦ	1	To “knock” at a door means to tap or hit it a few times to let a person inside the house know you are standing outside. You could translate this expression with the way people in your culture show that they have arrived at a house, such as “call out” or “cough” or “clap.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:13	c634		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν θύραν τοῦ πυλῶνος	1	Here, the word **gate** probably describes an entrance from the street to a courtyard in front of the house.

Alternate translation: “What you saw was Peter’s guardian angel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:16	wwg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀνοίξαντες δὲ εἶδαν αὐτὸν	1	While the word **they** refers to the people in the house as in the previous verse, it is likely that only some of them came to the door.

12:17	fr3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰακώβῳ	1	Peter assumes that his listeners will know that by **James**, he means the brother of Jesus who was the leader of the church in Jerusalem. UST models one way to express this implicit information.

12:20	oln5			ὁμοθυμαδὸν & παρῆσαν πρὸς αὐτόν	1	The word **unanimously** indicates that the Tyrians and Sidonians recognized that they had a common interest and that they agreed to act together to pursue that interest. See how you translated the same word in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “they agreed together to send representatives to him”
12:20	qsg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Βλάστον	1	The word **Blastus** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “their country depended on the king’s country for its food supply” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:20	dy51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τρέφεσθαι αὐτῶν τὴν χώραν ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλικῆς	1	The implication is that Herod had stopped supplying food to the people of Tyre and Sidon because he was angry with them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “their country depended on the king’s country for its food supply, and Herod had cut off that supply because he was angry with them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:21	e3w9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τακτῇ & ἡμέρᾳ	1	The implication is that this was the **day** on which Herod had agreed to meet with the representatives of the Tyrians and Sidonians. Alternate translation: “on the day when Herod had agreed to meet with them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:21	kv7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐνδυσάμενος ἐσθῆτα βασιλικὴν, καὶ καθίσας ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος	1	Putting on this **royal clothing**, which was visibly expensive, and sitting on the **throne** were symbolic actions by which Herod demonstrated that he was a wealthy and powerful king. He did these things to impress and intimidate the Tyrians and Sidonians as they negotiated. Alternate translation: “having put on royal clothing and having sat on the throne to show what a wealthy and powerful king he was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
12:21	g6ir			καθίσας ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος	1	The **throne** was where Herod formally addressed people who came to see him.
12:22	feyy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	Θεοῦ φωνὴ, καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώπου	1	The people are using one part of Herod, his **voice**, to represent all of him in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “This person who is speaking to us is a god, not a man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
12:23	iw57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀνθ’ ὧν οὐκ ἔδωκεν τὴν δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this reason before the result it led to (the angel striking Herod), as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
12:23	d419		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γενόμενος σκωληκόβρωτος, ἐξέψυξεν	1	The word translated **worm-eaten** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The word **worm-eaten** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:23	pjbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γενόμενος σκωληκόβρωτος, ἐξέψυξεν	1	It is not clear exactly what this means, and you might choose to say nothing further in your translation. However, this could mean: (1) that when the angel **struck** Herod, this caused a deep wound, and by the time Herod died of this wound, it was already infested with maggots. Alternate translation: “he died after his wound became so infected that it was infested with maggots” (2) that the word **struck** is figurative and it refers to an illness, a severe case of intestinal worms. Alternate translation: “he got such a severe case of intestinal worms that he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:24	sv8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ & λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν καὶ ἐπληθύνετο	1	Luke is expressing a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and.** The verb **being multiplied** tells in what way the word of God was **increasing**, that is, very rapidly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this same idea with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the word of God was increasing very rapidly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
12:24	m1sw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὁ & λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν καὶ ἐπληθύνετο	1	Luke is speaking of the way the message about Jesus was becoming more widespread as if the word of God itself were **increasing** and **being multiplied**. Alternate translation: “more and more people were hearing and believing the word of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
12:24	wn8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ & λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that God told the believers to spread by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
12:24	iwr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπληθύνετο	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God was multiplying it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:25	j2un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word translated **Then** to introduce information about what happened after Herod died. This is the end of the part of the story about him. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a larger story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
12:25	rt9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Βαρναβᾶς δὲ καὶ Σαῦλος ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ, πληρώσαντες τὴν διακονίαν	1	This can also be translated, “Then Barnabas and Saul returned, having completed their service in Jerusalem.” If that is the correct translation, then Luke is saying implicitly that they **returned** to Antioch. Alternate translation: “Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch, having completed their service in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:25	t7d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Βαρναβᾶς δὲ καὶ Σαῦλος ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ	1	Some ancient copies say that Barnabas and Saul returned “from” Jerusalem, which makes sense, since in the next verse, Barnabas and Saul are back in Antioch. If the reading **to** is correct, this verse may be indicating that they went somewhere else in Judea and then returned to Jerusalem before going back to Antioch. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
12:25	pv6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πληρώσαντες τὴν διακονίαν	1	This refers implicitly to the trip that Barnabas and Saul made to Jerusalem to deliver money from the believers in Antioch, which Luke describes in [11:29–30](../11/29.md). Alternate translation: “having delivered to the church leaders in Jerusalem the money that the believers in Antioch had collected” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:25	zhsc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἰωάννην, τὸν ἐπικληθέντα Μᾶρκον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See how you translated it in [12:12](../12/12.md). Alternate translation: “John, whom people called Mark” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:intro	rlh6				0	# Acts 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nVerses 1–4 describe how the Holy Spirit called Barnabas and Paul to go on a special mission to share the gospel of Jesus.\nVerses 5–12 describe how they shared the gospel on the island of Cyprus.\nVerses 13–52 describe how they shared the gospel in the city of Antioch in the province of Pamphylia.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the three quotations from Psalms in 13:33–35.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 13:41.\n\nThe chapter is where the second half of the Book of Acts begins. Luke writes more about Paul than about Peter, and he describes how the believers told the message about Jesus to Gentiles. Luke begins to tell about the mission trips on which the church at Antioch sent Barnabas and Saul.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### A light for the Gentiles\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if light were what enables sinful people to understand that what they are doing is wrong and begin to obey God. The Jews considered all Gentiles to be walking in darkness, but Paul and Barnabas spoke of telling the Gentiles about Jesus as if they were going to bring them physical light. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “the Lord”\n\nIn verses 2, 12, 48, and 49, Luke refers to Jesus by a respectful title, “the Lord.” Paul refers to Jesus the same way in verses 10 and 11. In your translation, you may wish to clarify that this means “the Lord Jesus.” Or you could state “Jesus,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “our” in Paul’s sermon in Antioch of Pisidia\n\nIn verses 17, 32, and 33, Paul uses the term **our** to refer to himself and the other Jews who are present in the synagogue; the term does not include the Gentiles who are also present. If your language marks the distinction between inclusive and exclusive “our,” use the form that would be natural in such a situation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
13:1	fij7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
13:1	srw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Συμεὼν ὁ καλούμενος Νίγερ	1	The word **Simeon** is the name of a man. The word **Niger** is another name by which he was known. This is not a racial epithet; it is the Latin word for “black,” and it probably indicates that he was African. Alternate translation: “Simeon the African” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:1	nqp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Συμεὼν ὁ καλούμενος Νίγερ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Simeon, whom people called Niger” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:1	ccel		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαναήν	1	The word **Manaen** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:1	o8jb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Λούκιος ὁ Κυρηναῖος	1	The word **Lucius** is the name of a man. The word **Cyrenian** is the name for someone who comes from the city of Cyrene. See how you translated it in [11:20](../11/20.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:1	u48c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σύντροφος	1	In this culture, rulers would sometimes bring the children of other parents into their homes to be raised and educated with their own children. This gave their children playmates and friends, and it was also a way of honoring or thanking the parents of the other children. A boy who was raised with the son of a ruler would be considered the **foster brother** of that son. There may be a similar role in your culture, and your language may have a term for it that you can use in your translation. You could also explain the meaning of the term “foster brother,” as UST does. Alternate translation: “the childhood playmate” or “the boyhood friend” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:1	hxh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	Ἡρῴδου τοῦ τετράρχου	1	In the Roman Empire, a **tetrarch** was the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province. **Herod the tetrarch** ruled over Galilee, one of four areas that the kingdom of his father, Herod the Great, was divided into after his death. (The Herod described in Chapter 12 was a different man, the grandson of Herod the Great and the nephew of Herod the tetrarch.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a general term instead of “tetrarch.” Alternate translation: “the ruler Herod” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:2	m70r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	λειτουργούντων & αὐτῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	The expression **ministering to** means that the believers in Antioch were worshiping God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “while they were worshiping the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:2	kox1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Peter is referring to Jesus here by a respectful title. Use a form for addressing someone respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: “of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
13:2	ifb9			ἀφορίσατε	1	Alternate translation: “Set apart”
13:2	j6ym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	εἰς τὸ ἔργον ὃ προσκέκλημαι αὐτούς.	1	The Holy Spirit is referring implicitly to the **work** of proclaiming the gospel of Jesus in new areas, Cyprus and Asia Minor. Since Luke describes Barnabas and Paul doing this work in the rest of this chapter and in Chapter 14, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
13:3	l0cj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	νηστεύσαντες, καὶ προσευξάμενοι, καὶ ἐπιθέντες τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῖς, ἀπέλυσαν	1	The pronouns **their** and **they** refer to the believers in Antioch, and the pronoun **them** refers to Barnabas and Saul. The phrase **having fasted and prayed** refers to all of them. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “after they had all fasted and prayed together, the believers in Antioch laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul, and then the believers released them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
13:3	ku45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπιθέντες τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῖς	1	The believers in Antioch **laid their hands** on Barnabas and Saul as a symbolic action to show that they were sending them on their mission with the blessing and support of the whole church and that they were entrusting them to God’s care. Alternate translation: “placed their hands on them as a sign of blessing and support and as a way of entrusting them to God’s care” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
13:3	p1us		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέλυσαν	1	While in this context the term **released** basically means “sent off,” the implication is that the believers in Antioch were freeing Barnabas and Saul of all of their responsibilities in the church so that they could go on the mission on which the Holy Spirit was sending them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they gave them the freedom to go on their new mission” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:4	abcj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ & ἐκπεμφθέντες	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Barnabas and Saul. Alternate translation: “Barnabas and Saul” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
13:4	pisj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκπεμφθέντες ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “because the Holy Spirit had sent them out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:4	iyh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατῆλθον	1	Luke says that Barnabas and Saul **went down** to Caesarea because that city is lower in elevation than Judea. Alternate translation: “traveled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:4	d1q5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σελεύκιαν	1	The word **Seleucia** is the name of a city that is on the seacoast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:5	at85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σαλαμῖνι	1	The word **Salamis** is the name of a city on the island of Cyprus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:5	ct8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message that the Holy Spirit wanted Barnabas and Saul to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:6	cl2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Πάφου	1	The word **Paphos** is the name of a major city on the island of Cyprus. It was where the Roman proconsul lived. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:6	zf3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εὗρον	1	The word **found** does not mean that Barnabas, Saul, and Mark were intentionally searching for a certain man. They happened to meet him. Alternate translation: “they happened to meet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:6	xe7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἄνδρα, τινὰ μάγον	1	The word **magician** here does not mean someone who entertains others with tricks based on slight of hand and optical illusions. It means someone who practices witchcraft or supernatural magic arts. Your language and culture may have a term for such a person that you can use in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:6	ak38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ᾧ ὄνομα Βαριησοῦς	1	The words **Bar Jesus** are a name that means “Son of Jesus.” However, there was no relation between this man and Jesus Christ. **Jesus** was a common name at that time. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:7	s1su		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ ἀνθυπάτῳ	1	A **proconsul** was a governor in charge of a Roman province. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the governor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:7	pf5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σεργίῳ Παύλῳ	1	The words **Sergius** and **Paulus** are the names of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:7	h5xx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἀνδρὶ συνετῷ	1	Luke provides this background information about Sergius Paulus to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
13:8	lp2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἐλύμας ὁ μάγος	1	The word **Elymas** is an Arabic word that Bar-Jesus was using as another name. Luke spells it out using Greek letters so his readers will know how it sounds, and then he says what it means, **the Magician**. In your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
13:8	qw4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὕτως γὰρ μεθερμηνεύεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “for that is how one translates his name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:8	w2xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζητῶν διαστρέψαι τὸν ἀνθύπατον ἀπὸ τῆς πίστεως	1	Here, **to turn** someone **away from** something is a metaphor for convincing someone to not do something. Alternate translation: “he attempted to persuade the governor not to believe the gospel message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:9	fy7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	Luke is speaking of Paul as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:9	w3lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom the Holy Spirit was inspiring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:10	un00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὦ πλήρης παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1	Paul is using the adjective **full** as a noun to identify Elymas as a person who is full of the negative qualities he describes. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “O you who are full of all deceit and all trickery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
13:10	u8n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὦ πλήρης παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **deceit** and **trickery**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “O you who are always deceiving and tricking other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:10	r8x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὦ πλήρης παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1	Paul is speaking of Elymas as if he were a container that was **full** of negative qualities. Alternate translation: “O you who practice all deceit and all trickery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:10	wq5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1	The terms **deceit** and **wickedness** mean similar things. Paul may be using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “of all evil treachery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
13:10	kdwj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1	Paul says **all** in these two instances as a generalization for emphasis. (But when he calls Elymas the **enemy of all righteousness**, that may be understood more literally.) Alternate translation: “of great deceit and great trickery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
13:10	d2pk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	υἱὲ διαβόλου	1	The expression **son of** describes a person who shares the qualities of something or someone else. Paul is saying that Elymas is acting like the devil in trying to keep Sergius Paulus from believing in Jesus. Alternate translation: “you who are acting like the devil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:10	jgq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	υἱὲ διαβόλου	1	Paul is drawing an implicit contrast between Elymas’ claim to be the “son of Jesus” (Bar Jesus) and his actual character as a **son of the devil**. If you retain the “son of” idiom in your translation, you could bring out this contrast explicitly. If you do, it may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are not the son of Jesus—you are the son of the devil!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:10	hlq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐχθρὲ πάσης δικαιοσύνης	1	Paul is speaking of **righteousness** as if it were a person who could have an **enemy**. If your language would not use this figure of speech, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “opposed to all righteousness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
13:10	wa8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐχθρὲ πάσης δικαιοσύνης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “enemy of everything that is right” or “opposed to everything that is right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:10	bc9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ παύσῃ διαστρέφων τὰς ὁδοὺς τοῦ Κυρίου τὰς εὐθείας?	1	Paul is using the question form to rebuke Elymas for opposing God. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you must stop turning aside the straight paths of the Lord!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
13:10	p8sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διαστρέφων τὰς ὁδοὺς τοῦ Κυρίου τὰς εὐθείας	1	Paul is speaking of Elymas as if he were physically redirecting **paths** that God wanted people to follow so that these paths no longer went **straight**. He means that if people believe in God and obey him, they live in the right way, and that Elymas is trying to keep people, especially Sergius Paulus, from doing that. Alternate translation: “preventing people from believing in God, obeying him, and living right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:11	q0w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Paul is using the term **behold** to focus Elymas’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:11	xul9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐπὶ σέ	1	Here the word **hand** represents the power of God, and the phrase **upon you** indicates punishment. Alternate translation: “the Lord is going to punish you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:11	w3gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τυφλὸς, μὴ βλέπων τὸν ἥλιον	1	Paul is using a word and a phrase together to express a single idea. The phrase **not seeing the sun** tells to what degree Elymas will be **blind**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase.

13:11	x7rt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἔπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἀχλὺς καὶ σκότος	1	Luke may be using the two words **mist** and **darkness** together to express a single idea. The word **mist** may tell what kind of **darkness** was all that Elymas could see. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “a misty darkness was all that Elymas could see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
13:12	x9fl			ὁ ἀνθύπατος	1	A **proconsul** was a governor in charge of a Roman province. Alternate translation: “the governor”
13:12	twa8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκπλησσόμενος ἐπὶ τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

That is, this does not mean “what the Lord taught,” it means “what Barnabas and Paul taught about the Lord.” you could state that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
13:13	r9hi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
13:13	i65t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	οἱ περὶ, Παῦλον	1	The phrase **those around Paul** refers to Barnabas and John (who is also called John Mark). This phrase provides some background to the rest of the story by indicating that Paul had become the leader of the group. It is important to communicate this by keeping Paul’s name first when he is mentioned with others, for example, in [13:46](../13/46.md), [13:50](../13/50.md), etc. The order of names is important. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
13:13	abcl			οἱ περὶ, Παῦλον	1	Alternate translation: “Paul and his traveling companions”
13:13	mmj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Πέργην τῆς Παμφυλίας	1	The word **Perga** is the name of a city, and the word **Pamphylia** is the name of the province in which that city was located. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

The fact that they were invited to speak ([13:15](../13/15.md)) suggests that this is the case. Alternate translation: “sat down as rabbis would, to ask permission to speak to the congregation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
13:15	dnb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν	1	The word **Law** is the name for one part of the Hebrew Scriptures, and the word **Prophets** is the name for another part of the Hebrew Scriptures. Even though these are common nouns, Luke is using them to mean specific things. Show this in your translation in the way that is natural in your language.

Use a form in your language that communicates an invitation. Alternate translation: “we invite you to speak it now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
13:16	keqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1	Here the term **arising** means that Paul stood up to show that he indeed wanted to speak, as he had been invited to do.

13:16	i8pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κατασείσας τῇ χειρὶ	1	This likely means that Paul waved his hand to get the attention of the audience and signal that he was about to speak. He wanted everyone in the synagogue to hear what he had to say from the very first word, so he did this to quiet them. Alternate translation: “waving his hand to signal that he was about to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
13:16	m0yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰσραηλεῖται, καὶ οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Θεόν	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You Israelites and you who fear God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:16	rh93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Θεόν	1	Jews in the time of the New Testament used the expression **fearing God** to describe Gentiles (non-Jews) who worshiped the God of Israel and attended the synagogue. That is what Paul means here. See how you translated the similar expression in [10:2](../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “you Gentiles who sincerely worship the God of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:16	ah55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἀκούσατε	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please listen to what I am about to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
13:17	se2b			ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου Ἰσραὴλ	1	Alternate translation: “The God whom the people of Israel worship”

13:17	aaj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λαὸν ὕψωσεν	1	When Paul says that God **exalted the people** of Israel when they were in Egypt, he is referring to the way God made them great in number and strength even while they were still slaves. Alternate translation: “greatly enlarged their population” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:17	vw4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	μετὰ βραχίονος ὑψηλοῦ	1	Here, **an uplifted arm** describes God’s mighty power. Alternate translation: “with great power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:18	zv9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἐτροποφόρησεν αὐτοὺς	1	This means “he put up with their disobedience.” Some ancient copies have a different word that means “he took care of them,” which makes sense, since in this part of his speech, Paul is listing all of the good things that God did for the Israelites. Paul would be quoting Deuteronomy 1:13 from a well-known Greek translation. If the reading **put up with them** is correct, Paul may be foreshadowing the warning he gives at the end of his speech in [13:40–41](../13/40.md). If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT and UST. Alternate translation: “he took care of them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
13:19	nvp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	κατεκληρονόμησεν τὴν γῆν αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God, the pronoun **them** refers to the Israelites, and the pronoun **their** refers to the seven nations that God destroyed. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers.

13:20	xyg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡς ἔτεσι τετρακοσίοις καὶ πεντήκοντα	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “All these events took place over a period of about 450 years” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
13:20	qmc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔδωκεν κριτὰς ἕως Σαμουὴλ προφήτου	1	This could mean: (1) that God gave the Israelites a series of judges and Samuel was the last of them. Alternate translation: “he gave them a series of judges ending with Samuel, who was also a prophet” (2) that the phrase ** Samuel the prophet** represents the time period associated with Samuel.

(Paul is quoting from 1 Samuel [13:14](../1sa/13/14.md) and Psalm [89:20](../psa/089/020.md).) Alternate translation: “he said, testifying, that he had found David, son of Jesse, a man according to his heart, who would do all his will” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
13:22	dbu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εὗρον	1	While God was indeed searching for someone to replace Saul, here the word **found** does not refer to the results of that search, but rather to God’s estimation of David.

13:23	xj5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τούτου & ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματος	1	This information is placed at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize that the Savior had to be one of David’s descendants. It would be appropriate to retain this order in your translation rather than say, for example, “According to promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, from the seed of this one.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
13:23	vnz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ σπέρματος	1	The term **seed** means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “the descendants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:23	l50d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τούτου	1	The demonstrative pronoun **this one** refers to David. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

13:24	xzf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	πρὸ προσώπου τῆς εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ	1	In your language, the expression **before the face of his entrance**, meaning “before the appearance of his entry into ministry” (see next two notes), might seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express.

13:24	abcn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου τῆς εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ	1	Here the term **face** means “appearance.” Alternate translation: “appearance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

13:24	gqs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῆς εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Jesus. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “of Jesus’ entrance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
13:24	x892		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	βάπτισμα μετανοίας παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **repentance**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to all the people of Israel a baptism that people received to show that they were repenting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:25	ntrj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν δρόμον	1	Paul is speaking of John as if he had been running a race or **course**. Alternate translation: “his work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

(As an indirect quotation, this would read something like this: “he asked the people who they thought him to be, and he told them he was not he and that behold, one was coming after him, the sandals of whose feet he was not worthy to untie.”) You may be able to indicate the beginning of Paul’s quotation from John with some punctuation or convention that your language uses.

13:25	gj98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν	1	In your language, the expression **the sandals of his feet** might seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express.

13:26	jdp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	Here the word **us** includes Paul and his entire audience in the synagogue, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks this distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

13:29	sq1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πάντα τὰ περὶ αὐτοῦ γεγραμμένα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:31	g4vl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡμέρας πλείους	1	We know from the Gospels that this period was 40 days. Translate **many days** with a term that would be appropriate for that length of time. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:31	rw9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τοῖς συναναβᾶσιν	1	Paul says **having come up** because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling to Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “by the ones who traveled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

13:32	hr2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας	1	Paul is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:33	b1uh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	ὅτι ταύτην ὁ Θεὸς ἐκπεπλήρωκεν τοῖς τέκνοις ἡμῶν	1	It may be helpful to create a verse bridge that combines verse 32 with the first part of verse 33. you could state something like this: “And we are proclaiming to you that by raising Jesus, God has completely fulfilled for our children the promise he made to our fathers.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
13:33	t0wt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταύτην	1	Paul assumes that his listeners will know that by **this** he means the promise he described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “this promise” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:33	dy6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τοῖς τέκνοις ἡμῶν	1	Some ancient copies read, “for us, their children” which makes sense, since Paul is saying that this promise was fulfilled in his own generation, not in the next generation. If the reading **for our children** is correct, Paul may mean “for the children of us Israelites.” If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

13:33	h9ir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τῷ ψαλμῷ & τῷ δευτέρῳ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “Psalm 2” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
13:33	ljnl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε	1	Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Psalm 2 as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Messiah directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language could use to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
13:33	c1pn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “You are my Son, yes, today I have fathered you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
13:33	tla1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱός & γεγέννηκά σε	1	**Son** is an important title that describes the relationship between Jesus and God. Be sure to retain this title in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Isaiah as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites and ultimately the Messiah directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
13:34	q3kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὰ ὅσια Δαυεὶδ τὰ πιστά	1	Paul is using the adjectives **holy** and **trustworthy** as nouns. ULT adds the word **things** to show this.

13:35	hvt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἰδεῖν διαφθοράν	1	Paul is using the word **see** to mean “experience.” Alternate translation: “to experience decay” or “to undergo decay” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

13:47	xbiw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τέθεικά σε εἰς φῶς ἐθνῶν, τοῦ εἶναί σε εἰς σωτηρίαν ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς	1	This quotation is from the prophet Isaiah. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Isaiah as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Messiah directly in it. (Paul and Barnabas are saying that since they are disciples of the Messiah, the quotation also refers to their ministry.) You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language could use to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
13:47	za1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σε	1	The word **you** is singular here because it refers to the Messiah. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

If you need to say who did the action, the context suggests that it was those who believed in Jesus. Alternate translation: “those who believed in Jesus spread the word of the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

13:50	cq9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξέβαλον αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῶν ὁρίων αὐτῶν	1	Luke is probably not speaking literally when he says that they **threw** them out.

13:50	kzzk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῶν ὁρίων αὐτῶν	1	Luke is describing the city of Antioch in Pisidia by association with the way that it had **boundaries** and its leading citizens could determine who could be within those boundaries.

14:intro	rsg2				0	# Acts 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1–4 describe how Paul and Barnabas proclaimed the gospel in Iconium.\n- Verses 5–19 describe how Paul and Barnabas proclaimed the gospel in Lystra.\n- Verses 20–28 describe how Paul and Barnabas proclaimed the gospel and strengthened the believers in several cities on their way back to Antioch.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “the word of his grace”\n\nThe expression “the word of his grace” refers to the message that God will graciously forgive and accept those who believe in Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n### Zeus and Hermes\n\nIn this chapter, Barnabas and Paul are mistaken for the pagan gods Zeus and Hermes. The Gentiles in the Roman Empire worshiped many different false gods that did not really exist. Paul and Barnabas told them to believe in the “living God,” that is, the one and only true God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “We must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings.”\n\nJesus told his followers before he died that everyone who followed him would suffer persecution. Paul and Barnabas were saying the same thing using different words as they encouraged the new believers in the cities that they had visited.

14:22	wu1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	δεῖ ἡμᾶς εἰσελθεῖν	1	By **us**, Paul and Barnabas mean both themselves and the believers to whom they were speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

14:27	qcl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὅσα ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεὸς μετ’ αὐτῶν	1	In many languages it would be an idiom to say that God **had done** something with Paul and Barnabas. It would mean that they had been the objects of God’s action. But the expression is not an idiom here. It means that Paul and Barnabas had been able to work in partnership **with** God. Alternate translation: “how much they had been able to do by working together with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
14:27	vymy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἤνοιξεν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν θύραν πίστεως	1	Here, the possessive form describes not a **door** consisting of **faith** but a door that leads to faith. Alternate translation: “a door leading to faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

15:intro	h917				0	# Acts 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nVerses 1–35 tell how the church resolved the question of whether Gentiles who believed in Jesus needed to keep the whole law of Moses.\nVerses 36–41 tell how Paul began a new journey to proclaim the gospel, bringing Silas with him.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 15:16–18.\n\nEven if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present the quotation from the prophet Amos in verses 16–18 as a direct quotation if possible, since in it God is speaking directly the people of Israel. Since Amos acknowledges in verse 17 that God is speaking by saying “says the Lord,” a third-level quotation actually starts in verse 16. ULT uses second-level and third-level quotation marks within the first-level quotation from James to identify the various speakers. But it may not be necessary to do this in your translation. You could just use second-level quotation marks or some other punctuation or convention available in your language to indicate the beginning and ending of the second-level quotation from Amos. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Did Gentiles have to obey the law of Moses?\n\nSome believers wanted the Gentiles to be circumcised because God had told Abraham and Moses that everyone who wanted to belong to him had to be circumcised, so this was a law that would always exist. But Paul and Barnabas had seen God give uncircumcised Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit, so they did not believe that the Gentiles needed to be circumcised. Both groups went to Jerusalem to have the church leaders decide what they should do. The meeting that the apostles and elders held to decide about this issue is commonly called the “Jerusalem Council.”
15:1	su66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τινες	1	Luke assumes that his readers will recognize that these were Jews who believed in Jesus.

15:10	qpyd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιθεῖναι ζυγὸν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον τῶν μαθητῶν, ὃν οὔτε οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν οὔτε ἡμεῖς ἰσχύσαμεν βαστάσαι	1	Peter is speaking as if the believers who are Pharisees literally want to put a **yoke** on the necks of the Gentile believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “requiring the disciples to meet an onerous obligation that neither our fathers nor we have been able to fulfill” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:10	bdfu			τὸν τράχηλον	1	Since Peter is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **neck**. Alternate translation: “the necks”
15:10	bfd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	Peter is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:11	e1m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	πιστεύομεν σωθῆναι	1	Peter is using a construction in which the object is implied. Since the object is the same as the subject of the verb, the construction calls for the relative pronoun **ourselves**. Your language may have its own way of expressing the same meaning. Alternate translation: “we believe that we will be saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
15:11	q28c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πιστεύομεν σωθῆναι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who will do the action, it is clear from the context that it will be God. Alternate translation: “we believe that God will save us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
15:11	nhq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	πιστεύομεν σωθῆναι	1	Peter is using the pronoun **we** and the implied pronoun **ourselves** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
15:11	d3z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “through what God has graciously done for us through the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
15:11	ln38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	Peter means implicitly that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus and not by obeying the law of Moses. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “through the grace of the Lord Jesus and not by obeying the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:11	e96c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καθ’ ὃν τρόπον κἀκεῖνοι	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “according to the way they also will be saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
15:11	c8mw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κἀκεῖνοι	1	Peter assumes that his listeners will know that he is using the pronoun **they** to refer to the Gentiles. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand this sentence. Alternate translation: “the Gentiles also will be saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:12	kxjq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα	1	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:43](../02/43.md). Alternate translation, as in UST: “great miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
15:13	odjm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίθη Ἰάκωβος λέγων	1	Together the words **answered** and **saying** mean that James responded to what everyone in the meeting had said to that point. Alternate translation: “James responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
15:13	pl6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Use a way that is natural in your language to refer to a particular group of people. Alternate translation: “My fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
15:14	jjyc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Συμεὼν	1	The word **Simeon** is the name of a man. It is the Hebrew form of the name whose Greek form is Simon. James is referring to Peter by his Hebrew name. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could use either the name Simon or the name Peter here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
15:14	abct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ Θεὸς ἐπεσκέψατο	1	James is speaking of the way God showed concern for the Gentiles by association with the way someone would look carefully at a situation he was concerned about. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God concerned himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:14	pnr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λαὸν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ	1	This could mean: (1) that God chose the Gentiles for himself. James would be using the term **name** to refer to a person, God, by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “a people who would belong to him” (2) that God chose the Gentiles to worship him. James would be using the term **name** to refer to worship by association with the way that worshipers call upon the name of God. Alternate translation: “a people who would worship him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:15	am6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ λόγοι τῶν προφητῶν	1	James is using the term **words** to mean the message that God spoke through the prophets. (This is a quotation from the prophet Amos.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the message of the prophets” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:15	j4f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as one of the prophets wrote” or “as the prophet Amos wrote” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
15:16	m3lq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	μετὰ ταῦτα ἀναστρέψω	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter about whether to represent this as the beginning of a third-level quotation or a second-level quotation, or whether to use some other punctuation or convention that is available in your language to indicate who the various speakers are in verses 16–18. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
15:16	h9um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀναστρέψω & ἀνοικοδομήσω & ἀνοικοδομήσω	1	The pronoun **I** refers to God, who is speaking through the prophet Amos. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “I, God, will return” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
15:16	wqi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀναστρέψω	1	God is speaking of showing favor to the Israelites once again as if he had gone somewhere else but will now **return**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will show favor to the Israelites once again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:16	fhdr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἀνοικοδομήσω τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυεὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν, καὶ τὰ κατεστραμμένα αὐτῆς, ἀνοικοδομήσω καὶ ἀνορθώσω αὐτήν	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will rebuild the fallen tent of David, yes, I will rebuild its ruins and restore it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
15:16	f5wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνοικοδομήσω τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυεὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν, καὶ τὰ κατεστραμμένα αὐτῆς, ἀνοικοδομήσω καὶ ἀνορθώσω αὐτήν	1	God is speaking of the royal dynasty of David as if it were a **tent** that had **fallen** down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will restore the dynasty of David, which is no longer ruling over the people of Israel, yes, I will make one of David’s descendants king again and restore his dynasty” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:16	u0r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυεὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the tent of David that has fallen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
15:17	hkw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, God is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. You may wish to indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “the remnant of humanity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
15:17	pe4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐκζητήσωσιν & τὸν Κύριον	1	God is speaking about himself in the third person. Alternate translation: “may seek me, the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
15:17	sm79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκζητήσωσιν & τὸν Κύριον	1	God is speaking as if the Gentiles would literally **seek** or look for him. The expression means that the Gentiles will begin to worship God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may begin to worship the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:17	s6de		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	It might seem that this phrase contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: “upon whom my name has been called” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
15:17	tu21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom I have called by my name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
15:17	c8gm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [15:14](../15/14.md). (1) Alternate translation: “who will belong to me” (2) Alternate translation: “who will worship me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:18	tr27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γνωστὰ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that people have known” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
15:19	pyb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ παρενοχλεῖν τοῖς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐθνῶν, ἐπιστρέφουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν	1	In your translation, you could make explicit in what way James does not want to **trouble** these **Gentiles**. Alternate translation: “that we should not require the Gentiles who are believing in God to be circumcised and obey the laws of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:19	vr6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέφουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν	1	James is speaking of these Gentiles as if they are physically **turning** to God. He means that they are believing in the true God and starting to live in a way that pleases him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this expression plainly. Alternate translation: “believing in God and obeying him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:20	vcm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	James lists four regulations in this verse and he gives the reason for them in the next verse. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 19–21. It might say something like this: “Therefore, I judge that we should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God. However, since Moses has had those proclaiming him in every city from ancient generations—he is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath—we should write to the Gentiles to abstain from the pollution of idols and sexual immorality and strangled things and blood.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
15:20	wx8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ἀλισγημάτων τῶν εἰδώλων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **pollution**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from things that idols have polluted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
15:20	qun9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῶν ἀλισγημάτων τῶν εἰδώλων	1	If your language would not use a possessive form here, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from things that idols have polluted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
15:20	n6f2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἀλισγημάτων τῶν εἰδώλων	1	James is likely talking about food that has been offered to **idols**, and he is speaking as if being offered to idols has polluted this food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from eating food that has been offered to idols” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:20	j2rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ πνικτοῦ, καὶ τοῦ αἵματος	1	God did not allow the Jews to consume blood in any form. Therefore, for one thing, they could not eat the meat from an animal that had been **strangled**, because the blood would not have been properly drained from the body of the animal. For another thing, while James is not saying that the Gentiles should have no contact at all with blood, he is saying implicitly that they should not consume blood. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “from eating the meat of animals that have been killed by strangulation, because this meat still contains blood, and from consuming blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:20	brc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	καὶ τοῦ πνικτοῦ	1	James is using the adjective **strangled** as a noun to mean animals that have been killed by strangulation. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “animals that have been killed by strangulation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
15:20	h27f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ πνικτοῦ	1	James is referring by association to meat from animals that have been killed by strangulation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from eating the meat of animals that have been killed by strangulation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:21	si1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Μωϋσῆς γὰρ ἐκ γενεῶν ἀρχαίων κατὰ πόλιν τοὺς κηρύσσοντας αὐτὸν, ἔχει ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς κατὰ πᾶν Σάββατον ἀναγινωσκόμενος	1	James is saying implicitly that Gentile believers should observe at least the four regulations he has listed because they embody essential aspects of the law of Moses (not worshiping idols, not practicing sexual immorality, and respecting the blood of sacrifices), and the law of Moses is well known because it is read aloud regularly in the Jewish synagogues. If the Gentiles did not observe even these regulations, that would upset Jewish believers and make Jews who were not yet believers more hostile to Christianity. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand what James is saying. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:21	zd7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Μωϋσῆς & ἐκ γενεῶν ἀρχαίων κατὰ πόλιν τοὺς κηρύσσοντας αὐτὸν, ἔχει & ἀναγινωσκόμενος	1	James is using the name **Moses** to mean the law associated with Moses.

15:21	wp1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναγινωσκόμενος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “People read him” or “People read from the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
15:21	xg5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατὰ πόλιν	1	The expression **by city** means “in every city,” and James implicitly means every city in which there are Jews. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “in every city in which there are Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:22	hp6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὅλῃ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	Here the word **church** describes the people who were part of the church. Alternate translation: “all the people of the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:22	g6e8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅλῃ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to the **church** in Jerusalem. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand this sentence. Alternate translation: “the church in Jerusalem” or “all the people of the church in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:22	c711		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰούδαν τὸν καλούμενον Βαρσαββᾶν	1	The words **Judas** and **Barsabbas** are the names of men. **Barsabbas** was another name by which **Judas** was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. See how you translated this same name for another man in [1:23](../01/23.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
15:22	s6lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἰούδαν τὸν καλούμενον Βαρσαββᾶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Judas, whom people called Barsabbas” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
15:22	s6d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the members of the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:23	k6cq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	γράψαντες διὰ χειρὸς αὐτῶν	1	Luke does not mean that the apostles and elders ask Judas and Silas to write out this letter for them. Rather, Luke is using the word **hand** to mean that Judas and Silas carried the letter and delivered it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “sending the following letter with them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:23	xz3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	χειρὸς αὐτῶν	1	Since Luke is referring to two people, it might be more natural in your language to use the dual or plural form here, as your language may require. Alternate translation: “their hands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
15:23	e4g2			οἱ ἀπόστολοι καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι, ἀδελφοὶ, τοῖς κατὰ τὴν Ἀντιόχειαν, καὶ Συρίαν, καὶ Κιλικίαν, ἀδελφοῖς τοῖς ἐξ ἐθνῶν, χαίρειν	1	This is the introduction of the letter. In the culture of this time, letter writers would give their own names first. Your language and culture may have its own way of introducing the author of a letter and saying to whom it is written. Alternate translation: “This letter is from your brothers, the apostles and elders. We are writing to you Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings to you” or “To our Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings from the apostles and elders, your brothers”
15:23	kp51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοὶ & ἀδελφοῖς	1	The apostles and elders are using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. By doing this, they are assuring the Gentile believers that they accept them as fellow believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to our fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:24	g8m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἠκούσαμεν & ἡμῶν & οὐ διεστειλάμεθα	1	Here and in the rest of the letter, by **we** and **us** (and “our”), the apostles and elders mean themselves and probably the rest of the church in Jerusalem, but not the Gentiles to whom they are writing, so use the exclusive forms of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
15:24	p1tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξ ἡμῶν	1	The apostles and elders seem to mean implicitly that these people have gone out from their community, but not from among themselves. That is, the word **some** refers to people who were part of the church in Jerusalem, but who were not apostles or elders. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “from our community” or “from here in Judea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:24	hbw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγοις	1	The apostles and elders are using the term **words** to mean what the people who have gone out from them have been teaching by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by what they have been teaching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:24	bxq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀνασκευάζοντες τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν	1	The apostles and elders are using one part of the people to whom they are writing, their **souls**, to mean the people themselves. Alternate translation: “upsetting you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
15:26	gldi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνθρώποις παραδεδωκόσι	1	By **men**, the letter implicitly means Paul and Barnabas. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Those two men have handed over” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:26	dhj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	παραδεδωκόσι τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν	1	The letter is using the term **souls** to mean the lives of Paul and Barnabas, by association with the way a living person has a soul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having handed over their lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:26	dinn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παραδεδωκόσι τὰς ψυχὰς αὐτῶν	1	The letter is speaking as if Paul and Barnabas have literally **handed over** their lives. This means that they have been willing to risk their lives. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having put their lives at risk” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:26	t7vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματος τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	This is a figurative expression. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. This could mean: (1) that the **name** of Jesus represents his person. Alternate translation: “out of loyalty to our Lord Jesus Christ” (2) that the **name** of Jesus represents his cause in the world. Alternate translation: “for the cause of our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:27	y972		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀπαγγέλλοντας τὰ αὐτά	1	The letter is using the adjective **same** as a noun to mean the details of the decision that the apostles and elders have reached. ULT adds **thing** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “confirming that this is our decision” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
15:27	xw8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ λόγου	1	The letter is using the term **word** to mean “by word of mouth,” that is, “in person.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:28	l9z6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μηδὲν πλέον & βάρος	1	The letter is speaking of the restrictions it describes as if they were a physical **burden** that the Gentiles would need to carry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no greater obligation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:28	bx90		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μηδὲν πλέον ἐπιτίθεσθαι ὑμῖν βάρος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

16:intro	e7z2				0	# Acts 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1–5 describe how Paul began his second missionary journey and met Timothy and brought him along with him.\n- Verses 6–12 describe how the Holy Spirit led Paul and his companions to share the gospel in the city of Philippi\n- Verses 13–40 describe how Paul and Silas made disciples in Philippi, delivered a young woman from an evil spirit, and were imprisoned but miraculously released. Acts [16:5](../16/05.md) is a summary statement that Luke uses to mark the transition into the fourth major part of the book.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Timothy’s circumcision\n\nPaul circumcised Timothy because he and Silas were telling the message of Jesus to Jews as well as to Gentiles. Many Jews would have been so offended that Timothy was not circumcised, even though his mother was Jewish, that they would not have listened to the message. Paul felt that he could have Timothy circumcised as a discretionary matter to remove an offense to hearing the gospel, even though the church leaders in Jerusalem had decided that Gentile believers did not have to be circumcised.

16:37	sw3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ἡμᾶς ἐξαγαγέτωσαν	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may they lead us out” or “they should lead us out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
16:37	x82d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἡμᾶς ἐξαγαγέτωσαν	1	It is likely that Paul wanted the magistrates to bring him and Silas out of prison, which would effectively be an apology for mistreatment, so that the believers in Philippi would have the protection of the law even after Paul and his companions left the city. However, this is more a matter of interpretation than of implied information, so it would probably be best not to put an explanation of it in your translation. You can leave it to teachers and preachers of the Bible to explain. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
16:38	ldfi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα	1	Luke is using the term **words** to mean what Paul said to the officers by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what Paul had said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
16:38	ym2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν & ἀκούσαντες ὅτι Ῥωμαῖοί εἰσιν	1	Roman citizenship provided freedom from torture and the right to a fair trial. So the implication is that the magistrates were **terrified** that more important Roman authorities might learn how they had mistreated Paul and Silas. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they were terrified when they heard that they were Roman citizens, because as magistrates they were supposed to make sure that citizens were not tortured and received fair trials, and they were concerned that more important authorities would punish them for the way they had treated Paul and Silas” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
16:38	lqs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἐφοβήθησαν & ἀκούσαντες ὅτι Ῥωμαῖοί εἰσιν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “they were terrified when they heard, ‘They are Romans!’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
16:39	q59h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παρεκάλεσαν αὐτούς & ἐξαγαγόντες, ἠρώτων	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the magistrates, and the pronoun **them** refers to Paul and Silas. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the magistrates entreated Paul and Silas … bringing them out, the magistrates were asking Paul and Silas” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
16:39	a7yq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρεκάλεσαν αὐτούς	1	Luke means implicitly that the magistrates **entreated** or begged Paul and Silas not to make any protest about how they had been treated. In effect, they apologized to them and asked them to overlook the offense. Alternate translation: “they apologized to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
16:40	y14i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **So** to introduce information about what happened at the end of the story of the imprisonment of Paul and Silas. Your language may have its own way of presenting such information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
16:40	ylk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν Λυδίαν	1	Luke is referring to the house of **Lydia** by association with the name of the woman who lived there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they came to the house of Lydia” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
16:40	t1pf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	εἰσῆλθον	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “they went” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
16:40	ntc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
16:40	qs0x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	καὶ ἐξῆλθαν	1	Luke says that **they … went out**, meaning Paul and Silas, to refer to those two men and to Timothy, who was still traveling with them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and then Paul and Silas and Timothy left Philippi” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
16:40	gld6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἐξῆλθαν	1	Since Luke says **they … went out**, not “we went out,” the implication is that Luke remained in Philippi for a time, likely to strengthen and encourage the new believers there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:intro	gj4c				0	# Acts 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1–9 describe how Paul, Silas, and Timothy proclaimed the gospel in the city of Thessalonica.\n- Verses 10–14 describe how Paul, Silas, and Timothy proclaimed the gospel in the city of Berea.\nVerses 15–34 describe how Paul proclaimed the gospel in the city of Athens.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The religion of Athens\n\nPaul said that the people in the city of Athens were “religious,” but this did not mean that they worshiped the true God. They worshiped many different false gods. In the past they had conquered other peoples, and they had begun to worship the gods of the peoples they had conquered. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\nAs Paul spoke to the philosophers in Athens, he told the message of Christ for the first time to people who knew nothing of the Old Testament.
17:1	e4w5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

17:3	lt8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	διανοίγων καὶ παρατιθέμενος	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two expressions connected with **and**. The phrase **fully opening them** tells how Paul was **demonstrating** from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “by opening the Scriptures fully, demonstrating” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
17:3	ir9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διανοίγων	1	Luke is speaking as if Paul had been literally **opening** the Scriptures **fully**, as by unrolling a scroll, so that the Jews in the synagogue could understand them.

17:4	es2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τινες ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐπείσθησαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

17:11	k2st		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information about the Jews in Berea to help readers understand what happens next in the story.

17:11	alq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτοι & τῶν ἐν Θεσσαλονίκῃ	1	Luke is using the demonstrative pronoun **these** to refer to the Jews in Berea and the demonstrative pronoun **those** to refer to the Jews in Thessalonica.

Epicureans believed that all things were formed by chance and that the gods were too busy being happy to be bothered with governing the universe. They rejected the resurrection and wanted only simple pleasures. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
17:18	f976		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Στοϊκῶν	1	The word **Stoic** is the name of another kind of philosopher. Stoics believed that freedom comes from resigning oneself to fate. They rejected a personal, loving God and the resurrection. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
17:18	g4bv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ σπερμολόγος	1	These Athenian philosophers are using a common expression in their culture that refers negatively to a person who only knows little bits of information. The expression depicts a person picking up words or ideas the way a bird picks up seeds. The philosophers are saying that Paul has only a few bits of information that are not worth listening to. Alternate translation: “uneducated person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
17:18	sx9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ξένων δαιμονίων	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that the Athenian philosphers misunderstood Paul and thought that he was introducing two new **gods** that the Greeks and Romans had not known about before, Jesus and Anastasis (the Greek word for resurrection). You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “of two new gods, Jesus and Anastasis” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:19	unc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	Ἄρειον Πάγον	1	The word **Areopagus** means “Hill of Ares” in Greek. It was named after the pagan god whose name was Ares in Greek and Mars in Latin. Luke does not explain the meaning of this word, since his readers already understand Greek. ULT spells this name the way it sounds in English. In your translation, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language. You could also translate the meaning of the word and use the name “Mars Hill,” as UST does. Or you could spell the word the way it sounds and then explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “Mars Hill” or “the Areopagus, that is, Mars Hill” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
17:19	b56g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τὸν Ἄρειον Πάγον	1	Luke most likely means that the philosophers from the marketplace brought Paul to meet the main group of philosophers on the Areopagus, not that they just brought Paul to the hill itself. Luke would be using the word **Areopagus** by association to mean the philosophers who gathered there. Alternate translation: “to the philosophers who met on the Areopagus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
17:19	aciu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	δυνάμεθα γνῶναι τίς ἡ καινὴ αὕτη, ἡ ὑπὸ σοῦ λαλουμένη, διδαχή?	1	This is not actually a rhetorical question, since the philosophers really do want to know whether Paul is willing to explain himself more fully to the group at the Areopagus. However, if in your language it might seem to be a rhetorical question, you could translate it as a statement instead. Alternate translation: “We would like to know what this new teaching is that is being spoken by you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
17:19	g9gb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	δυνάμεθα	1	By **we**, the philosophers mean themselves but not Paul, to whom they are speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
17:19	n250		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ ὑπὸ σοῦ λαλουμένη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

17:20	lay8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ξενίζοντα & τινα εἰσφέρεις εἰς τὰς ἀκοὰς ἡμῶν	1	The philosophers are speaking of Paul’s teachings about Jesus and the resurrection as if they were objects that one person could bring to another person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are saying some startling things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
17:20	us7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ξενίζοντα γάρ τινα εἰσφέρεις εἰς τὰς ἀκοὰς ἡμῶν	1	The philosophers are referring to hearing by association with the **ears**, which people use to hear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “we are hearing you say some startling things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
17:20	fs5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & βουλόμεθα	1	By **our** and **we**, the philosophers mean themselves but not Paul, to whom they are speaking, so use the exclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
17:20	fe4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τίνα θέλει ταῦτα εἶναι	1	The philosophers are using an idiom. Your language may have a similar idiom that you could use in your translation.

17:21	d8yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀθηναῖοι	1	The word ** Athenians** is the name for people who live in or come from the city of Athens. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “something newer than the last new thing they had said or heard” (2) that Luke may be using the comparative form **newer** with simple positive meaning. Alternate translation: “something new” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:22	k5dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σταθεὶς δὲ Παῦλος ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἀρείου Πάγου ἔφη	1	If your language does not use the passive form **having been stood**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

17:22	zq3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἀρείου Πάγου	1	As in [17:19](../17/19.md), Luke uses the word **Areopagus** by association to mean the philosophers who gathered there. He does not mean that the philosophers placed Paul in the middle of the hill known as the Areopagus. Alternate translation: “in the middle of the group of philosophers who met on the Areopagus” or “in the middle of the group of philosophers who met on Mars Hill” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

17:22	kcag			δεισιδαιμονεστέρους	1	Paul is using the comparative form **more religious** for emphasis. Your language may use comparative forms in the same way. If not, you could convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “very religious”
17:22	ja1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	κατὰ πάντα	1	Paul says **everything** here as a generalization for emphasis. He is referring to the Athenians’ public display of honoring the gods through prayers, building altars, and offering sacrifices.

17:23	nmwv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	βωμὸν ἐν ᾧ ἐπεγέγραπτο, ἀγνώστῳ Θεῷ	1	Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this as a direct quotation if possible, since it is the inscription on the altar that Paul is describing. You may be able to enclose this quotation in second-level quotation marks or use some other punctuation or convention that is available in your language to indicate a second-level quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
17:23	t3mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ ἐπεγέγραπτο	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

17:26	cnbu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πᾶν ἔθνος ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “every nation of humanity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
17:27	s2xs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζητεῖν τὸν Θεὸν	1	Paul means implicitly that God did the things he described in the previous verse, giving the nations of humanity particular times to live in particular places, so that they would **seek** him.

17:27	p8hk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μακρὰν ἀπὸ	1	Paul is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “close to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
17:27	onm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	Paul is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

While it would be preferable to present these two quotations as direct quotations (see next note), you could translate them as indirect quotations so that there are not direct quotations within a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “For some of your own poets have said that in him we live and are moved and are and that we too are his offspring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
17:28	rpaz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ἐν αὐτῷ γὰρ ζῶμεν καὶ κινούμεθα καὶ ἐσμέν; ὡς καί τινες τῶν καθ’ ὑμᾶς ποιητῶν εἰρήκασιν, τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν	1	Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present these two quotations as direct quotations if possible, since that would show that Paul is quoting Greek poets as he speaks to the philosophers in Athens.

Alternate translation: “For he is the source of our entire existence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
17:28	cbd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν αὐτῷ γὰρ ζῶμεν καὶ κινούμεθα καὶ ἐσμέν	1	If your language does not use the passive form **are moved**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

17:28	lil5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ γὰρ καὶ γένος ἐσμέν.	1	Aratus and Cleanthes do not mean that people are literally God’s **offspring** or children. They are speaking and poetically. It would be good to preserve the poetic effect if possible, but it would be clearer for your readers, you could express this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “For it is as if we too are his offspring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
17:29	k9ws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γένος & ὑπάρχοντες τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul is speaking as if people were literally God’s **offspring** or children.

17:31	htp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δικαιοσύνῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way.

17:32	txre		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	καὶ πάλιν	1	It might seem that the expression **also again** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language.

17:34	vcx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κολληθέντες αὐτῷ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

They had not yet heard about Jesus. One of these Jews was Apollos. He followed John the Baptist, but he did not know that the Messiah had come. John had baptized people to show that they were sorry for their sins, but that kind of baptism was different from Christian baptism. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])

18:15	aaql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγου	1	By **word**, Gallio likely means speech, expressed in words, as opposed to action.

Since the Jewish leaders who were hostile to Paul were also hostile to him, a further implication is that, like Crispus, Sosthenes had become a believer in Jesus. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. (However, see next note for another possibility that some interpreters favor.) Alternate translation: “the new synagogue leader, who believed in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:17	mj77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιλαβόμενοι δὲ πάντες Σωσθένην τὸν ἀρχισυνάγωγον, ἔτυπτον ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ βήματος	1	This could mean: (1) that the Jewish leaders were beating Sosthenes because he was a believer in Jesus.

18:17	cyk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες & ἔτυπτον	1	Luke likely says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis.

18:18	ceor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	εἶχεν γὰρ εὐχήν	1	Luke seems to offer the information that Paul had made a **vow** as the explanation for why he **stayed yet many days** in Corinth despite the danger he was in. It may be more natural in your translation to put this information right after the phrase it seems to explain, **having stayed many days**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
18:18	cf3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	εἶχεν γὰρ εὐχήν	1	Luke tells us nothing further about why Paul made this vow or what he did to carry it out, so it would not be appropriate to add any information in your translation about why Paul made it.

Many people came to Ephesus to see this temple, and they bought statues of the goddess Artemis while they were there. The people who sold statues of Artemis were afraid that if people did not believe Artemis was a real goddess, they would stop giving the sellers money for statues.

19:23	rwf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῆς ὁδοῦ	1	As the General Notes to Chapter 9 explain, **the Way** was one of the first names that people used to describe the community of believers in Jesus. If your language has a word for “way” or “path” that you can use as a name, it would be appropriate to use it here. See what you did in [19:9](../19/09.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
19:24	cg16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	τις & ἀργυροκόπος & παρείχετο	1	Luke is using the phrase **a certain silversmith** to introduce **Demetrius** as a new participant in the story.

19:24	opb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Δημήτριος	1	The word **Demetrius** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
19:24	wg95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ναοὺς ἀργυροῦς Ἀρτέμιδος	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that Ephesus had a large temple dedicated to the goddess **Artemis**. (She was known as Diana in Latin; she was a false goddess of fertility.) Since Demetrius describes this temple in verse 27, you do not need to provide information about it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
19:24	nwt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀργυροκόπος	1	A **silversmith** is a craftsman who works with silver metal to make statues and jewelry.

19:24	p58m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐκ ὀλίγην ἐργασίαν	1	Luke is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a great deal of business” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
19:25	f8rm			οὓς συναθροίσας καὶ τοὺς περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐργάτας, εἶπεν	1	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He gathered together the craftsmen, along with workers in similar occupations, and said”
19:25	w1xd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	περὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα	1	Luke is using the adjective **such** as a noun to mean a certain kind of work. ULT adds the word **things** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this expression with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “in similar occupations” or “who did similar crafts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
19:26	rm6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	θεωρεῖτε καὶ ἀκούετε	1	Demetrius is referring to perception by naming the two major means of perception. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you perceive clearly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
19:26	rx32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μετέστησεν ἱκανὸν ὄχλον	1	Demetrius is speaking as if Paul had physically **removed** a crowd that had been patronizing the artisans in Ephesus. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “has caused a considerable crowd to stop buying our shrines” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
19:26	z7e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ διὰ χειρῶν γινόμενοι	1	Demetrius is using one part of the artisans, their **hands**, to represent all of them in the act of making idols. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “things which people make” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
19:27	j3bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ τῆς μεγάλης θεᾶς Ἀρτέμιδος ἱερὸν, εἰς οὐθὲν λογισθῆναι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that people will consider the temple of the great goddess Artemis to be nothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
19:27	hz7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἣν ὅλη ἡ Ἀσία καὶ ἡ οἰκουμένη σέβεται	1	This was an exaggeration to show how popular the goddess Artemis was. Alternate translation: “whom people from all over the province of Asia and the world worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

19:29	u42d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθη ἡ πόλις τῆς συγχύσεως	1	Luke is speaking of **the city** as if they was a container that **confusion** filled. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “there was confusion throughout the city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
19:29	u51d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπλήσθη ἡ πόλις τῆς συγχύσεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **confusion**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “people throughout the city were confused” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
19:29	ej3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ θέατρον	1	The **theater** in Ephesus was an outdoor semi-circular area with bench seats that could hold thousands of people. It was used for public meetings and for entertainment such as plays and music. If the word “theater” would communicate the wrong idea in your language, you could use a term that would be clearer for your readers. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the stadium” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
19:29	d6r9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Γάϊον & Ἀρίσταρχον	1	The words **Gaius** and **Aristarchus** are names of men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
19:31	o6qt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῶν Ἀσιαρχῶν	1	The word **Asiarchs** is the name for the provincial officers who governed the Roman province of Asia. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
19:31	we87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ & αὐτὸν & παρεκάλουν & ἑαυτὸν	1	The pronouns **him** and **himself** refer to Paul. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “of Paul’s … him … were urging Paul … himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
19:31	r183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δοῦναι ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὸ θέατρον	1	The expression **to give himself** means “to go,” but it suggests risk and danger.

19:33	ukaw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνεβίβασαν Ἀλέξανδρον	1	The implication is that some people **instructed Alexander** about how he could speak to everyone in the theater.

Alternate translation: “instructed Alexander about how he could speak to everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:33	jr85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀλέξανδρον	1	The word **Alexander** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
19:33	j1mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κατασείσας τὴν χεῖρα	1	This likely means that Alexander was **waving his hand** to get the attention of the audience and signal that he was about to speak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this specifically in your translation. Alternate translation: “waving his hand to signal that he was about to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
19:33	tlq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπολογεῖσθαι τῷ δήμῳ	1	The implication is that Alexander wanted to explain that although he and his fellow Jews did not worship idols themselves, they were not opposing the business of making silver shrines of Artemis. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to explain to the people that he and his fellow Jews were not responsible for the artisans losing business” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:34	tyx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἐπιγνόντες & ὅτι Ἰουδαῖός ἐστιν,	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “recognizing, ‘He is a Jew!’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
19:34	u1hp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φωνὴ ἐγένετο μία ἐκ πάντων, ὡς & κραζόντων	1	Luke is speaking as if the people in the theater collectively had only **one voice**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they all shouted together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
19:35	sy9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ γραμματεὺς	1	This **city clerk** was a high official in the government of Ephesus. He was not merely someone who kept records. In your translation, you could use a term for someone in a comparable role in your culture. Alternate translation: “an alderman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
19:35	n4qz			φησίν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, here Luke uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “said”
19:35	gox9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἐφέσιοι	1	This is an idiomatic form of address. Use a way that is natural in your language to refer to a particular group of people. Alternate translation: “Citizens of Ephesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
19:35	mtsc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τίς γάρ ἐστιν	1	The city clerk is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “you should stop this uproar because, after all, who is there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
19:35	sd3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς & ἐστιν ἀνθρώπων, ὃς οὐ γινώσκει τὴν Ἐφεσίων πόλιν νεωκόρον οὖσαν τῆς μεγάλης Ἀρτέμιδος καὶ τοῦ διοπετοῦς?	1	The city clerk is using the question form to emphasize that the people of Ephesus do not need to be concerned that the worship of Artemis is in peril. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “there is no one of men who does not know that the city of Ephesus is the temple warden of the great Artemis and of the Zeus-fallen image!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
19:35	k8dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	τίς & ἐστιν ἀνθρώπων, ὃς οὐ γινώσκει	1	The city clerk’s question becomes a double negative when it takes the form of a statement or exclamation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression instead. Alternate translation: “all men know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
19:35	gqr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τίς & ἐστιν ἀνθρώπων, ὃς οὐ γινώσκει	1	A generalization for emphasis is implicit in the city clerk’s question, and this generalization becomes explicit when the question takes the form of a statement or exclamation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “men know very well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
19:35	zzmv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τίς & ἐστιν ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, the city clerk is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “what person is there” or, as a statement or exclamation, “all people know” or “people know very well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
19:35	hiw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	τὴν Ἐφεσίων πόλιν νεωκόρον οὖσαν τῆς μεγάλης Ἀρτέμιδος	1	The term **temple keeper** was an honorary title that cities assumed when they built and maintained temples to the gods that the Greeks and Romans worshiped or to the emperor. In your translation, use an expression that shows that the city clerk is using honorific language. Alternate translation: “the city of Ephesus has the honor of hosting the temple of the great Artemis” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
19:35	afd1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῦ διοπετοῦς	1	The city clerk is using the adjective **Zeus-fallen** as a noun to mean a specific kind of object. ULT adds the word **image** to show that. (Within the temple of Artemis was an image of the goddess. It had been fashioned from a meteorite that had fallen from the sky. The people of Ephesus thought that this rock had come directly from Zeus, whom they considered the ruler of their pagan gods.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the image that fell from the sky from Zeus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
19:35	fdfk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τοῦ διοπετοῦς	1	The word **Zeus** is the name of a pagan god. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
19:36	o0ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κατεσταλμένους ὑπάρχειν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

19:36	xj2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲν προπετὲς πράσσειν	1	The city clerk means implicitly that it would be **rash** for the people to do anything to harm Gaius and Aristarchus, as he says in the next verse. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “not to act impulsively and hurt the two men you have brought here” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:36	s67q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μηδὲν προπετὲς πράσσειν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative word **nothing** and the negative adjective **rash**. Alternate translation: “to be careful about what you do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
19:37	cuhh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In this verse, the city clerk is giving the reason why the people of Ephesus should not harm Gaius and Aristarchus impulsively. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 36–37. It might say something like this: “You brought these two men here even though they are neither temple-robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. Therefore it is necessary for you to be calmed and to do nothing rash, since it is undeniable that people from throughout the world come to Ephesus to worship Artemis.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
19:37	s8a9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοὺς ἄνδρας τούτους	1	The pronoun **these** refers to refers to Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul’s traveling companions ([Acts 19:29](../19/29.md)). While the city clerk does not refer to them by name, you could find a way to identify them for your readers. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
19:38	zkx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔχουσιν πρός τινα λόγον	1	The city clerk is using the term **word** to mean an accusation that Demetrius might make against Gaius and Aristarchus by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “wish to make an accusation against anyone” or “wish to bring a charge against anyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
19:38	i14r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀγοραῖοι ἄγονται καὶ ἀνθύπατοί εἰσιν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the proconsuls are holding court sessions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
19:38	szf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνθύπατοί	1	The **proconsuls** were the Roman governor’s representatives who made legal decisions in court. In your translation, you could use a term for someone in a comparable role in your culture. Alternate translation: “judges” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
19:38	o1vf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ἐγκαλείτωσαν ἀλλήλοις	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they may accuse one another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
19:38	g8tp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐγκαλείτωσαν ἀλλήλοις	1	The pronoun **them** refers both to Demetrius and his colleagues and to Gaius and Aristarchus. The city clerk does not mean that Demetrius and his colleagues will accuse each other. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “let Demetrius and the craftsmen bring a charge against these men, and let these men respond” or “Demetrius and the craftsmen may bring a charge against these men, and these men may respond” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
19:39	hxh3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰ δέ τι περὶ ἑτέρων ἐπιζητεῖτε	1	The word **seek** does not mean that Demetrius and his colleagues would be searching for something. The city clerk is speaking. Alternate translation: “But if you have other matters to discuss” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
19:39	wga5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν τῇ ἐννόμῳ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἐπιλυθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the regular assembly will settle it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
19:39	dsmg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἐν τῇ ἐννόμῳ ἐκκλησίᾳ ἐπιλυθήσεται	1	The city clerk may be using a future statement to give an command. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form for giving a command. Alternate translation: “you must settle it in the regular assembly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
19:39	et5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῇ ἐννόμῳ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	This **regular assembly** refers to a public gathering of citizens over which the county clerk presided. In your translation, you could use a term for a comparable deliberative body in your culture. Alternate translation: “the town meeting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
19:40	sds7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κινδυνεύομεν ἐνκαλεῖσθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, the context suggests that it would be the Roman authorities. Alternate translation: “we are in danger of the Roman authorities accusing us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
19:40	efat		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τῆς σήμερον	1	The city clerk is leaving out a word that a sentence would ordinarily need in Greek in order to be complete. The clerk is abbreviating the expression “the today day,” which means “this day.” You can say that in your translation if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “this day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
19:40	up3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῆς σήμερον	1	The city clerk is referring to the events that were nearly a riot, by association with the day on which they took place.

19:40	jtdu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μηδενὸς αἰτίου ὑπάρχοντος, περὶ οὗ οὐ δυνησόμεθα ἀποδοῦναι λόγον	1	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “there being no cause about which we will not be able to give an account.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “because we would have to have a reason in order to give an account” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
20:intro	u91c				0	# Acts 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter Luke describes Paul’s last visits to believers in the provinces of Macedonia and Asia before he went to Jerusalem.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Race\n\nPaul spoke of living for Jesus as if he were running in a race. By this he meant that he needed to keep working hard even when things were difficult and he wanted to quit. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/discipline]])\n\n### “Compelled by the Spirit”\n\nPaul thought that the Holy Spirit wanted him to go to Jerusalem even if Paul did not want to go there. The same Holy Spirit told other people that when Paul arrived in Jerusalem, people would try to harm him.
20:2	edb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὺς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the believers in the **regions** of Macedonia. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the believers there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
20:3	ah5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	Luke is using the name of a whole group, **the Jews**, to refer to some members of that group.

20:3	bdq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γνώμης τοῦ ὑποστρέφειν διὰ Μακεδονίας.	1	The expression **of a resolution** means that Paul resolved to do something.

20:4	dpyn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Σώπατρος Πύρρου	1	Here, the possessive form indicates that **Sopater** is the son of **Pyrrhus**.

The word **Asians** describes people from the province of Asia. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
20:4	w8j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀρίσταρχος & Γάϊος	1	The words **Aristarchus** and **Gaius** are the names of men. See how you translated these names in [19:29](../19/29.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
20:5	y35x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here Luke begins to use the pronouns **us** and **we** to refer to himself and his traveling companions, but not to his readers. So use the exclusive form of those words throughout this chapter if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
20:5	gb5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτοι	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the seven men who were traveling with Paul, whom Luke lists in the previous verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “those seven men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
20:5	o1bl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡμᾶς	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that he says **us** because he joined Paul and his other companions at this point in the story. You can include this information if it will help your readers understand what is happening. UST models a way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:6	l5dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὰς ἡμέρας τῶν Ἀζύμων	1	The words **Unleavened Bread** are the name of a Jewish religious observance that took place over several **days**. See how you translated this in [12:3](../12/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
20:7	xsyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῇ μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	Luke is using the adjective **first** as a noun to mean a particular day of the **week**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the first day of the week” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
20:7	wpfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that the believers met on **the first of the week** because that was the day Jesus rose from the dead. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the first day of the week, when Jesus rose from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:7	tgsb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνηγμένων ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

20:7	zff8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	κλάσαι ἄρτον	1	Luke could be using the word **break** to mean “eat,” and he could be using the word **bread** to mean “food.” In each case he would be using one part of something to mean the whole thing. Breaking bread is one thing people do when they eat it, and bread is one kind of food. So this could be a reference to the believers sharing a meal together. Alternate translation: “to share a meal” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
20:7	ckiy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κλάσαι ἄρτον	1	By **to break bread**, Luke could also mean remembering the death of Jesus in the way that Jesus commanded, by literally breaking a loaf of bread and sharing it (and also sharing a cup of wine).

20:7	j888		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message that Paul was sharing by using words.

20:8	t6on		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἦσαν & λαμπάδες ἱκαναὶ ἐν τῷ ὑπερῴῳ, οὗ ἦμεν συνηγμένοι	1	The implication seems to be that it became warm in this **upper room** because there were **many lamps** lit in it, and this helps account for why Eutychus fell asleep, as Luke describes in the next verse. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “it was warm in the upper room where we were gathered together because many lamps were in it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:8	ak8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑπερῴῳ	1	In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built above other rooms. According to the next verse, this room was actually built above a room that was built above another room. If your community does not have houses like that, you could use another expression to describe a large indoor space where people could meet. See how you translated this in [9:37](../09/37.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
20:8	cshh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἦμεν συνηγμένοι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

20:9	tsp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταφερόμενος ὕπνῳ βαθεῖ & κατενεχθεὶς ἀπὸ τοῦ ὕπνου	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “a deep sleep overcoming him … sleep having overcome him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “starting to sleep deeply … becoming completely asleep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
20:9	kh3h			τριστέγου	1	In this culture, the **third story** meant a level two floors above the ground floor. Some languages and cultures consider the “first story” to be one level above the ground floor, and so they would consider this level, two stories above the ground floor, to be the “second story.” You can say that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.
20:9	jp89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤρθη νεκρός	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, the context suggests that it was the believers who were meeting with Paul. Alternate translation: “the believers picked him up dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:9	z1wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤρθη νεκρός	1	The implication is that some of the believers rushed down to help Eutychus but discovered that he had died from the fall. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they lifted him from the ground, but he had died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:10	uban		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ θορυβεῖσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Do not let this trouble you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:10	gfol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ & ψυχὴ αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ ἐστιν	1	Paul is speaking as if the life of Eutychus were contained within him.

Breaking and tasting bread are things people do when they eat bread, and bread is one kind of food. So this could be a reference to the believers sharing a meal together. Alternate translation: “having shared a meal with the believers” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
20:11	upkb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κλάσας τὸν ἄρτον καὶ γευσάμενος	1	By ** having broken bread and having tasted **, Luke could also mean remembering the death of Jesus in the way that Jesus commanded, by literally breaking a loaf of bread and sharing it (and also sharing a cup of wine).

20:11	av7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐξῆλθεν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Paul. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Paul left” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
20:12	lih8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	δὲ	1	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce information about what happened at the end of the story of Eutychus. Your language may have its own way of presenting such information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
20:12	jkj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν παῖδα	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that by **the boy**, he means Eutychus. You can use his name if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Eutychus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

20:13	w4ew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἡμεῖς δὲ, προελθόντες ἐπὶ τὸ πλοῖον, ἀνήχθημεν ἐπὶ τὴν Ἆσσον, ἐκεῖθεν μέλλοντες ἀναλαμβάνειν τὸν Παῦλον; οὕτως γὰρ διατεταγμένος, ἦν μέλλων αὐτὸς πεζεύειν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Paul intended to go on foot to Assos and he arranged for us to take him on board there, so we went ahead to the ship and sailed away to Assos” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
20:13	q4yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὴν Ἆσσον	1	The word **Assos** is the name of a town on the coast of the Aegean sea. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
20:13	nq2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μέλλων αὐτὸς πεζεύειν	1	In light of what Paul says in [20:23](../20/23.md), that the Holy Spirit was showing him that he would soon suffer and be imprisoned, the implication seems to be that Paul wanted to **go on foot himself** so that he could be alone for a while and reflect and pray.

20:15	bbeq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατηντήσαμεν	1	Luke says that he and his traveling companions **came down** to a point on the mainland **opposite Chios** because that was the customary way in this culture of describing a person arriving somewhere after traveling by sea.

20:15	ulk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Χίου	1	The word **Chios** is the name of an island in the Aegean Sea. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

20:18	vw6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐπέβην εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν	1	Paul is using one part of himself, his **foot**, to represent all of himself in the act of arriving in Asia.

Alternate translation: “The one thing I do know that will happen to me in her is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
20:22	a9j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῇ	1	The pronoun **her** refers to the city of Jerusalem. Conventionally, Greek referred to cities with feminine pronouns.

20:24	w8d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τελειῶσαι τὸν δρόμον μου, καὶ τὴν διακονίαν ἣν ἔλαβον παρὰ τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul is speaking about this **race** and **ministry** as if they were objects that Jesus gave him and he **received**.

21:intro	gh1j				0	# Acts 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nActs 21:1–19 describes Paul’s journey to Jerusalem. After he arrived in Jerusalem, the believers there told him that the Jews wanted to harm him and advised what he should do so they would not harm him (verses 20–26). Even though Paul did what the believers told him to do, the Jews tried to kill him. The Romans rescued him and gave him a chance to speak to the Jews.\n\nThe last verse of the chapter ends with an incomplete sentence. Most translations leave the sentence incomplete, as the ULT does.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “They are all determined to keep the law”\n\nThe Jews in Jerusalem were following the law of Moses. Even those who were following Jesus still kept the law. Both groups thought that Paul had been telling Jews in Greece not to keep the law. But it was only the Gentiles to whom Paul was saying that.\n\n### Nazarite vow\n\nThe vow that Paul and his three friends made was probably a Nazarite vow, because they shaved their heads ([Acts 21:23](../21/23.md)).\n\n### Gentiles in the temple\n\nThe Jews accused Paul of bringing a Gentile man into a part of the temple into which God only allowed Jews to go. They thought that God wanted them to punish Paul by killing him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n### Roman citizenship\n\nThe Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens.
21:1	s3h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & ἤλθομεν	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, throughout this chapter Luke uses the pronoun **we** (as well as the pronouns “us” and “our”) to refer to himself and his traveling companions, but not to his readers.

21:29	t2z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In this verse, Luke is giving the reason why the Jews from the province of Asia thought that Paul had “defiled” the temple area by bringing “Greeks” into it. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 28–29. It might say something like this: “Now some Jews from Asia had seen Trophimus the Ephesian with Paul in the city. When they saw Paul in the temple when the seven days were about to be finished, they were thinking that Paul had brought Trophimus into the temple. So they were agitating the whole crowd, and they laid their hands on him, shouting, ‘Men, Israelites, help! This is the man teaching all everywhere against the people and the law and this place. And he has even both brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

21:30	xd6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκλείσθησαν αἱ θύραι	1	The implication is that the gatekeepers **shut** the **doors** to the temple courtyard once the mob dragged Paul outside so that the mob would not defile the temple precincts by killing Paul within them.

22:intro	gq5g				0	# Acts 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis is the second account of Paul’s conversion in the book of Acts. Because this is such an important event in the early church, there are three accounts of Paul’s conversion. (See: [Acts 9](../09/01.md) and [Acts 26](../26/01.md))\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “In the Hebrew language”\n\nMost Jews at this time spoke Aramaic and Greek. Most of the people who spoke Hebrew were educated Jewish scholars. This is why the people paid attention when Paul started speaking in Hebrew.\n\n### “The Way”\n\nNo one knows for sure who first started calling believers “followers of the Way.” This is probably what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or “way.” If this is true, the believers were “following the way of the Lord” by living in a way that pleased God.\n\n### Roman citizenship\n\nThe Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens. The “chief captain” could have been punished for treating a Roman citizen the same way he would treat a noncitizen.

22:7	d6nd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνῆς λεγούσης μοι	1	Paul is using one part of this speaker, his **voice**, to represent all of him in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “someone saying to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
22:7	a477		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με διώκεις?	1	The voice is using the question form to rebuke Saul. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate its words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the rebuke in another way. Alternate translation: “you should not be persecuting me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:8	a478		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ δὲ ἀπεκρίθην, τίς εἶ, κύριε? εἶπέν τε πρὸς ἐμέ, ἐγώ εἰμι Ἰησοῦς ὁ Ναζωραῖος, ὃν σὺ διώκεις	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And in response I asked this divine figure who he was, and he told me that he was Jesus the Nazarene, whom I was persecuting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:8	a479		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	τίς εἶ, κύριε	1	Paul was not yet acknowledging that Jesus was **Lord**. He used that respectful title because he recognized that he was speaking to someone of divine power. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could use a similar term of respect. Alternate translation: “Who are you, Sir” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
22:9	h95h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν & φωνὴν οὐκ ἤκουσαν	1	In this context the word **hear** likely means “understand,” since Luke says in [9:7](../09/07.md) that the men traveling with Paul did actually hear the voice. You may wish to make this clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “they did not understand the voice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:10	a480		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπον δέ, τί ποιήσω, Κύριε? ὁ δὲ Κύριος εἶπεν πρός με, ἀναστὰς πορεύου εἰς Δαμασκόν, κἀκεῖ σοι λαληθήσεται περὶ πάντων ὧν τέτακταί σοι ποιῆσαι	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But I asked the Lord what I should do, and the Lord told me to get up and go into Damascus, because there it would be told to me about all that had been appointed to me to do’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:10	a91a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σοι λαληθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone will tell you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:10	a481		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πάντων ὧν τέτακταί	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “all that God has appointed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:11	n1kb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ τῆς δόξης τοῦ φωτὸς ἐκείνου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “because that light was so bright” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
22:11	qyf0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	χειραγωγούμενος ὑπὸ τῶν συνόντων μοι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “with the ones being with me leading me by the hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:11	a482		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθον	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “I went” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
22:12	a17q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	τις ἀνὴρ εὐλαβὴς	1	Paul is using the phrase **a certain devout man** to introduce **Ananias** as a new participant in his story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
22:12	e7uw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μαρτυρούμενος ὑπὸ πάντων τῶν κατοικούντων Ἰουδαίων	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom all the Jews there attested” or “of whom all the Jews there spoke well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:13	a483		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπέν μοι, Σαοὺλ, ἀδελφέ, ἀνάβλεψον	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “addressed me as a brother and told me to look up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:13	un4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Σαοὺλ, ἀδελφέ	1	Ananias was using the word **brother** as a title for **Saul**. The two men were not actual brothers. This could mean: (1) that Ananias was already addressing Saul as someone who shared the same faith. Alternate translation: “Saul, my fellow believer” (2) that Ananias is addressing Saul as a fellow Israelite, as the word “brother” is used in [3:17](../03/17.md) and many other places in this book. Alternate translation: “Saul, my fellow Israelite” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:13	a484		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἀνάβλεψον	1	In one sense, this was not a command that Paul was capable of obeying, since he could not see. Instead, it was a command that directly caused him to be healed, if he would **look up** as if he could see. Alternate translation: “if you look up, you will be able to see” or see next note for another possibility. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative)
22:13	x3kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνάβλεψον	1	The expression **look up** can also mean “see again,” that is, to have one’s sight restored. If this is the meaning, then Ananias was telling Paul what Jesus was going to do for him. Alternate translation: “Jesus is restoring your sight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:13	se47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	In the ancient world, an **hour** was the shortest time span that people envisioned. In this context, the term does not mean a literal hour of 60 minutes, but it means the shortest time imaginable. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “right at that instant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:13	x4s0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κἀγὼ & ἀνέβλεψα εἰς αὐτόν	1	Paul means implicitly that when he **looked up** at Ananias, he was able to see him clearly. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “And … when I looked up at him, I could see him” or see next note for another possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:14	a485		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὁ δὲ εἶπεν, ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν προεχειρίσατό σε γνῶναι τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ καὶ ἰδεῖν τὸν Δίκαιον, καὶ ἀκοῦσαι φωνὴν ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And he told me that the God of our fathers had appointed me to know his will and to see the Righteous One and to hear the voice from his mouth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:14	a486		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν πατέρων	1	Paul is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:14	a487		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸν Δίκαιον	1	Ananias is using the adjective **Righteous** as a noun to mean a particular person who is righteous. ULT adds the word **one** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the One who is righteous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
22:14	a488		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν Δίκαιον	1	Ananias is referring to the Messiah by association with the way the Messiah was **Righteous**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:14	dg8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	φωνὴν ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	It might seem that the expression **the voice from his own mouth** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: “his own voice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
22:15	a489		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι ἔσῃ μάρτυς αὐτῷ πρὸς πάντας ἀνθρώπους, ὧν ἑώρακας καὶ ἤκουσας	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation, continuing from the previous verse: “because I would be a witness for him to all men of what I had seen and heard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:15	i5q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πρὸς πάντας ἀνθρώπους	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Ananias was using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “to all people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
22:16	a490		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ νῦν τί μέλλεις? ἀναστὰς, βάπτισαι καὶ ἀπόλουσαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου, ἐπικαλεσάμενος τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He asked me why I was delaying, and he told me to arise and be baptized and wash away my sins, calling on the name of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:16	bhg9			καὶ νῦν	1	Here, **now** does not mean “at this moment”; Ananias is using the term to draw attention to the important point that follows. Alternate translation: “So listen”
22:16	a491		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς	1	Here the term **arising** means that Ananias wanted Paul to take action, not that he wanted him to stand up from a sitting or lying position. Alternate translation: “Come on” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:16	lt2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βάπτισαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

22:16	zr5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἀπόλουσαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας σου	1	Ananias is speaking as if Paul could literally **wash away** his **sins**. He is using a word picture to convey his meaning. He means that just as washing one’s body removes dirt, if Paul repents and asks Jesus for forgiveness, Jesus releases him from the guilt and power sin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to show that you are asking Jesus to free you from sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:16	g5dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπικαλεσάμενος τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “calling on him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:16	a492		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	By **his name**, Ananias implicitly means the name of Jesus. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the name of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:17	its2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δέ μοι	1	Paul is using this phrase to introduce a significant development in his story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new development. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
22:18	a493		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν λέγοντά μοι, σπεῦσον καὶ ἔξελθε ἐν τάχει ἐξ Ἰερουσαλήμ, διότι οὐ παραδέξονταί σου μαρτυρίαν περὶ ἐμοῦ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

22:18	a494		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σπεῦσον καὶ ἔξελθε ἐν τάχει	1	The expressions **Hurry** and **in haste** mean similar things. Jesus was using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Go away as fast as you can” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
22:19	a495		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	κἀγὼ εἶπον, Κύριε, αὐτοὶ ἐπίστανται ὅτι ἐγὼ ἤμην φυλακίζων καὶ δέρων κατὰ τὰς συναγωγὰς, τοὺς πιστεύοντας ἐπὶ σέ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And I told the Lord that they themselves knew that I was imprisoning and beating by synagogues those who believed in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:19	q5cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ ἐπίστανται	1	The pronouns **they themselves** refers to the non-believing Jews in Jerusalem. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews here in Jerusalem who do not believe in you know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
22:19	im4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ ἐπίστανται	1	Paul is adding the word **themselves** for emphasis. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “they know very well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
22:20	a496		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ὅτε ἐξεχύννετο τὸ αἷμα Στεφάνου τοῦ μάρτυρός σου, καὶ αὐτὸς ἤμην ἐφεστὼς, καὶ συνευδοκῶν, καὶ φυλάσσων τὰ ἱμάτια τῶν ἀναιρούντων αὐτόν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

22:20	udrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξεχύννετο τὸ αἷμα Στεφάνου τοῦ μάρτυρός σου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, recall from chapter 7 that it was the enemies of Stephen. Alternate translation: “the enemies of Stephen your witness spilled his blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:20	y7t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐξεχύννετο τὸ αἷμα Στεφάνου τοῦ μάρτυρός σου	1	Paul is referring to Stephen’s death by association with the way his **blood** was **spilled** when his enemies killed him.

22:22	a499		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπῆραν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν λέγοντες	1	Luke is speaking as if the crowd in Jerusalem literally **lifted up** its **voice**. He means that they spoke loudly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they shouted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:22	a500			τὴν φωνὴν αὐτῶν	1	If you would like to retain the metaphor in your translation of “lifting up a voice” but it would be unusual in your language to speak as if a whole group of people had one **voice**, you could make this plural. Alternate translation: “their voices”
22:22	ta8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	αἶρε ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς τὸν τοιοῦτον	1	The crowd is referring to Paul’s death by association with the way they would **remove** him **from the earth** if they killed him.

You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “we should have killed him even before he spoke to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:23	b6a7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ῥιπτούντων τὰ ἱμάτια	1	When the people in the crowd removed their outer garments, this was at least a symbolic action indicating that they felt they should stone Paul to death. They took off their long robes as they would have done in order to throw stones at Paul more easily. But some of the people may actually have intended to try to stone Paul even though he was in the custody of the Roman soldiers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “casting off their outer garments as if they were going to throw stones at Paul to kill him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “Paul asked the centurion who was standing by whether it was lawful for him and his soliders to scourge a man who was a Roman and had not been condemned.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
22:25	yjw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	εἰ ἄνθρωπον Ῥωμαῖον καὶ ἀκατάκριτον, ἔξεστιν ὑμῖν μαστίζειν?	1	Paul is using the question form to challenge the right of the centurion and his soldiers to whip him.

22:26	pca7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί μέλλεις ποιεῖν?	1	The centurion is using the question form to warn the commander that he should not have Paul whipped.

Alternate translation: “You should not be doing this!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:26	a506		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τί μέλλεις ποιεῖν?	1	The centurion is speaking of the commander, one person who was involved in having Paul whipped, to mean everyone who was involved. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “We should not be doing this!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

23:intro	gbw5				0	# Acts 23 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 23:5.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrection of the dead\n\nThe Pharisees believed that after people died, they would become alive again and God would either reward them or punish them. The Sadducees believed that once people died, they stayed dead and would never become alive again. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/raise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])\n\n### “Called a curse”\n\nSome Jews promised God that they would not eat or drink until they killed Paul, and they asked God to punish them if they did not do what they had promised to do.\n\n### Roman citizenship\n\nThe Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens. The “chief captain” could have been punished for treating a Roman citizen the same way he would treat a non-citizen.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Whitewash\n\nThis is a common metaphor in Scripture for appearing to be good or clean or righteous when one is evil or unclean or unrighteous. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

25:intro	b6uk				0	# Acts 25 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Favor\n\nThis word is used in two different ways in this chapter. When the Jewish leaders asked Festus for a favor, they were asking him to do something special for them on that day. They wanted him to do for them something that he would not usually do. When Festus “wanted to gain the favor of the Jews,” he wanted them to like him and be willing to obey him in the months and years to come. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/favor]])\n\n### Roman citizenship\n\nThe Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens; others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens. Roman officials could have been punished for treating a Roman citizen the same way they would treat a non-citizen.

26:6	l576		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν	1	Paul is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
26:6	l577		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν	1	By **our**, Paul means himself and his fellow Jews but not Agrippa to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
26:7	hnf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ δωδεκάφυλον ἡμῶν	1	Paul is referring to the people of Israel by association with the way that nation was historically composed of 12 tribes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
26:7	l578		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	τὸ δωδεκάφυλον ἡμῶν	1	By **our**, Paul means himself and his fellow Jews but not Agrippa to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
26:7	l579		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἐκτενείᾳ & λατρεῦον	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **earnestness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “serving earnestly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
26:7	kzg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	νύκτα καὶ ἡμέραν	1	Paul is using the two parts of a full day, **night** and **day**, to refer to continuous activity throughout a full day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “continually” or, if you translated **serving in earnestness** as “serving earnestly”: “and continually” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
26:7	a580		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνκαλοῦμαι ὑπὸ Ἰουδαίων	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Jews are accusing me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
26:7	c4lm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὑπὸ Ἰουδαίων	1	Paul is using the name of a whole group, **the Jews**, to refer to some members of that group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by these Jewish leaders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
26:8	de83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἄπιστον κρίνεται παρ’ ὑμῖν, εἰ ὁ Θεὸς νεκροὺς ἐγείρει?	1	Paul is using the question form to challenge the Jewish leaders who are accusing him. Many of them are Pharisees who believe that God does raise the dead, and yet they do not believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “By accusing me, you are acting as if you do not believe that God raises the dead!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
26:8	l581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	παρ’ ὑμῖν	1	While to this point Paul has used the word **you** in the singular to refer to Agrippa, here he uses it in the plural to refer to the Jewish leaders who are present. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
26:8	a599		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ὁ Θεὸς νεκροὺς ἐγείρει	1	Paul is speaking as if what he is saying is a hypothetical possibility, but he believes that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if the speaker believes that it is true, then you can translate these words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “that God raises the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
26:8	ukk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	νεκροὺς ἐγείρει	1	Here, **raises the dead** is an idiom that refers to making someone who has died alive again. Alternate translation: “God makes the dead alive again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
26:8	l582		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	νεκροὺς	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to mean people who have died. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
26:9	r4df		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ὄνομα Ἰησοῦ	1	While in such contexts the word **name** often represents the person who has that name, Paul is describing a time when he did not believe that Jesus was still alive. So here the word **name** seems to represent the reputation and influence of Jesus. Alternate translation: “the reputation and influence of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
26:10	b581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῶν ἁγίων	1	Paul is using the term **saints** by association to mean believers in Jesus. See how you translated the term in [9:33](../09/33.md). Alternate translation: “of the believers in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
26:10	b582		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀναιρουμένων & αὐτῶν	1	Paul is using one part of the process of putting someone on trial for a capital offense and punishing that person if he is found guilty to represent the entire process. Since he speaks of casting his **vote** in favor of execution, here he means specifically the trial part of the process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when they were being put on trial for crimes with a penalty of death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
26:10	nys7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναιρουμένων & αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when the Sanhedrin was considering whether to execute them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
26:10	l584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατήνεγκα ψῆφον	1	The implication is that Paul **cast his vote** as a member of the Sanhedrin. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as a member of the Sanhedrin, I cast my vote against them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
26:11	b584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	κατὰ πάσας τὰς συναγωγὰς & τιμωρῶν αὐτοὺς	1	Paul says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “going from one synagogue to another to punish them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
26:12	ajp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	μετ’ ἐξουσίας καὶ ἐπιτροπῆς	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **authority** tells what kind of **commission** the **chief priests** gave Paul. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “with an authoritative commission” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
26:14	l585		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἤκουσα φωνὴν, λέγουσαν πρός με τῇ Ἑβραΐδι διαλέκτῳ, Σαοὺλ, Σαούλ, τί με διώκεις? σκληρόν σοι πρὸς κέντρα λακτίζειν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language, calling me twice by name, asking me why I was persecuting him, and telling me it was hard for me to kick against a goad.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
26:14	sip5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἤκουσα φωνὴν, λέγουσαν πρός με	1	Paul is speaking of this **voice** as if it were a living thing that could speak on its own. Alternate translation: “I heard someone saying to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
26:14	du3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με διώκεις?	1	The voice is using the question form to rebuke Saul. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate its words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the rebuke in another way. Alternate translation: “you should not be persecuting me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
26:14	zsi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκληρόν σοι πρὸς κέντρα λακτίζειν	1	The voice is speaking as if Paul were literally kicking against a **goad**, that is, a sharp object that people use to prod an animal. The voice means that by opposing Jesus and persecuting believers, Paul is hurting himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are hurting yourself by what you are doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
26:15	l586		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ δὲ εἶπα, τίς εἶ, κύριε? ὁ δὲ Κύριος εἶπεν, ἐγώ εἰμι Ἰησοῦς, ὃν σὺ διώκεις	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And I asked the Lord who he was, and the Lord said that he was Jesus, whom I was persecuting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
26:15	l587		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	τίς εἶ, κύριε	1	When Paul replied to the voice, he was not yet acknowledging that Jesus was **Lord**. He used that respectful title because he recognized that he was speaking to someone of divine power. If this might be confusing for your readers, in your translation you could use a similar term of respect. Alternate translation: “Who are you, Sir” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
26:15	l588		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	ὁ & Κύριος εἶπεν	1	In this case Paul is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Use a form for addressing someone respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
26:16	l589		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἀλλὰ ἀνάστηθι, καὶ στῆθι ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας σου; εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ ὤφθην σοι, προχειρίσασθαί σε ὑπηρέτην καὶ μάρτυρα, ὧν τε εἶδές με ὧν τε ὀφθήσομαί σοι	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He told me to get up and stand on my feet, because for this he had appeared to me, to appoint me a servant and a witness both of the things in which I had seen him and of the things in which he would be shown to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
26:16	a590		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἀνάστηθι, καὶ στῆθι ἐπὶ τοὺς πόδας σου	1	It might seem that the expression **get up and stand on your feet** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: “stand up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
26:16	a591		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὀφθήσομαί σοι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I will show myself to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
26:17	a592		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐξαιρούμενός σε ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν ἐθνῶν, εἰς οὓς ἐγὼ ἀποστέλλω σε,	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He told me that he would rescue me from the peoples and from the Gentiles, to whom he was sending me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
26:17	a593		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ λαοῦ	1	By **the people**, Jesus means specifically the Jewish people. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
26:18	a594		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἀνοῖξαι ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι ἀπὸ σκότους εἰς φῶς, καὶ τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ Σατανᾶ ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν, τοῦ λαβεῖν αὐτοὺς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν καὶ κλῆρον ἐν τοῖς ἡγιασμένοις πίστει τῇ εἰς ἐμέ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “to open their eyes to turn from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, for them to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among the ones having been sanctified by faith in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
26:18	fk1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνοῖξαι ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν, τοῦ ἐπιστρέψαι	1	Jesus is speaking of Paul helping people to understand the truth about him as if Paul would literally **open** the **eyes** of these people. Alternate translation: “to help them understand the truth about me so that they will turn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
26:18	gw8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψαι ἀπὸ σκότους εἰς φῶς	1	Jesus is speaking of Paul helping people to stop doing what is wrong and to start obeying God as if the Paul would be literally helping these people stop directing their attention to **darkness** and start directing it to **light**. Alternate translation: “so that they will stop doing what is wrong and start obeying God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
26:18	q3h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ Σατανᾶ ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν	1	By **authority**, Jesus implicitly means the control that **Satan** has over people who are under his authority. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and no longer have Satan control them but have God control them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
26:18	m65i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τοῦ λαβεῖν αὐτοὺς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν καὶ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **forgiveness**, you could express the same idea with the verb “forgive.” Alternate translation: “so that God may forgive their sins and give them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
26:18	m9ve		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κλῆρον ἐν	1	Jesus is speaking of the blessings that he gives to those who believe in him as if they were an **inheritance** such as children receive from their parents. Alternate translation: “the blessings that I give to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
26:18	c5ij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῖς ἡγιασμένοις πίστει τῇ εἰς ἐμέ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

26:19	zv2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἐγενόμην ἀπειθὴς	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative adjective **disobedient**. Alternate translation: “I was obedient” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
26:19	sn4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῇ οὐρανίῳ ὀπτασίᾳ	1	Paul is referring to Jesus by association with the way Jesus spoke to him in this **vision**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to Jesus, who spoke to me from heaven in this vision” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
26:20	fei4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέφειν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν	1	Paul is speaking as if he declared that people should physically **turn** to God. He means that he proclaimed they should stop living in one way and begin to live in another way. Alternate translation: “start obeying God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
26:20	h1v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἄξια τῆς μετανοίας ἔργα πράσσοντας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **repentance**, you could express the same idea with the verb “repent.” Alternate translation: “doing deeds that showed that they had truly repented” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “the same things that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
26:23	pe9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ παθητὸς ὁ Χριστός; εἰ πρῶτος ἐξ ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν, φῶς μέλλει καταγγέλλειν	1	Paul could be saying that this is what Moses and the prophets said about the Messiah. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They addressed the question as to whether the Christ would be a sufferer, as to whether he, the first from the resurrection of the dead, was going to proclaim” or see next note for another possibility. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “Now since the Christ was a sufferer, since he was the first from the resurrection of the dead, then he was going to proclaim light” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
26:23	p9t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρῶτος ἐξ ἀναστάσεως νεκρῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **resurrection**, you could express the same idea in another way.

26:23	sc5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to mean people who have died. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

26:23	z2ms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φῶς μέλλει καταγγέλλειν	1	Paul is saying that the truth that Jesus proclaimed about God was like a **light** that allowed people to see.

26:23	a595		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ & λαῷ	1	By **the people**, Paul means specifically the Jewish people. Alternate translation: “to the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
26:24	a596			ὁ Φῆστος & φησιν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, here Luke uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “Festus said”
26:24	tk27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τὰ πολλά σε γράμματα εἰς μανίαν περιτρέπει	1	Festus is speaking of **learning** as if it were a living thing that was **turning** Paul from sanity to insanity. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You have become insane from learning so much” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
26:25	dur9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μαίνομαι	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative adjective **insane**. Alternate translation: “I am completely sane” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
26:25	a6pb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	κράτιστε Φῆστε	1	The expression **most excellent** was a formal title by which people addressed Roman officials.

26:26	tta8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	λανθάνειν & αὐτὸν τι τούτων οὐ πείθομαι οὐθέν	1	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “I am not persuaded that not any of these things eludes him.” In Greek, the second negative creates a positive meaning by canceling the first negative. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I am persuaded that not one of these things at all eludes him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

26:26	i5wg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν γωνίᾳ	1	Paul is speaking as if Jesus might have done things secretly, as if he had done them **in a corner** of a room where no one could see him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “secretly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this question as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should believe what I am saying about Jesus since you believe the prophets, King Agrippa.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
26:28	y8qq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐν ὀλίγῳ με πείθεις Χριστιανὸν ποιῆσαι?	1	Agrippa is using the question form to challenge Paul. He is asserting that what Paul has said so far is not sufficiently persuasive. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. The term **little** could mean: (1) little proof. Alternate translation: “You cannot persuade me to become a Christian with so little proof.” (2) little time. Alternate translation: “You cannot persuade me to become a Christian in such a short time.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

26:29	k7kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	παρεκτὸς τῶν δεσμῶν τούτων	1	Paul is using one aspect of imprisonment, the **chains** that bound prisoners at this time, to mean the entire state of being imprisoned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without being imprisoned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
26:31	blz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐδὲν θανάτου ἢ δεσμῶν ἄξιον τι πράσσει ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος	1	The king and governor are referring to a penalty of death by association with **death** itself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This man does not deserve to receive the death penalty or to be kept in chains” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
26:31	dwyb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	δεσμῶν	1	These people who heard Paul speak are using one aspect of imprisonment, the **chains** that bound prisoners at this time, to mean the entire state of being imprisoned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “of being imprisoned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
26:32	n293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπολελύσθαι ἐδύνατο ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You could have released this man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:intro	r82x				0	# Acts 27 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sailing\n\nPeople who lived near the sea traveled by boats powered by the wind. During some months of the year, the wind would blow in the wrong direction or so hard that sailing was impossible.\n\n### Trust\n\nPaul trusted God to bring him safely to land. He told the sailors and soldiers to trust that God would also keep them alive. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])\n\n### Paul breaks bread\n\nLuke uses almost the same words here to describe Paul taking bread, thanking God, breaking it, and eating it that he used to describe the last supper Jesus ate with his disciples. However, your translation should not make your reader think that Paul was leading a religious celebration here.
27:1	b2yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκρίθη τοῦ ἀποπλεῖν ἡμᾶς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Roman authorities decided that we should sail” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:1	l604		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκρίθη τοῦ ἀποπλεῖν ἡμᾶς	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that he says **us** because he joined Paul at this point in the story. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand what is happening. UST models a way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
27:1	a600		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	As the General Notes to this chapter explain, here and in several other places Luke says “we,” **us**, and “our” to mean himself and others who were traveling with him, but not his readers. So use the exclusive form of those words if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
27:1	s6ny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἑκατοντάρχῃ ὀνόματι Ἰουλίῳ	1	Luke is using the phrase **a centurion** to introduce **Julius** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
27:1	un2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰουλίῳ	1	The word **Julius** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:1	d22f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	σπείρης Σεβαστῆς	1	The **Augustan regiment** was the name of the military unit from which this centurion came. Some versions translate this as the “Imperial regiment.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:2	efe4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀδραμυντηνῷ	1	The word ** Adramyttium ** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:2	dnr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πλοίῳ & μέλλοντι πλεῖν	1	Luke is referring to what the crew of this ship was about to do by association with the ship itself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a ship whose crew was about to sail it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
27:2	h3uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀριστάρχου	1	The word **Aristarchus** is the name of a man who came from Macedonia but who had been working with Paul in Ephesus. See how you translated his name in [19:29](../19/29.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:3	a602		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατήχθημεν εἰς Σιδῶνα	1	As the General Notes to this chapter explain, Luke says that he and the other travelers **came down** to Sidon because that was the customary way in this culture of describing people arriving somewhere after traveling by sea. Your language may have its own way of describing that. Alternate translation: “we landed at Sidon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:3	rp73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπιμελείας τυχεῖν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **care**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that they could care for him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
27:4	mjt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑπεπλεύσαμεν τὴν Κύπρον	1	The expression **sailed under** does not mean that the travelers sailed south of the island of Cyprus, such as Luke describes in [21:3](../21/03.md), even though that would have been the shortest route. Rather, **sailed under** means that the ship kept close to the northern shore of the island, which loomed above the ship and blocked the wind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express that meaning plainly. However, if the people of your culture are familiar with sea travel, you could use the corresponding expression that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “we stayed close to the northern shore of Cyprus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:5	y6m6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατήλθαμεν εἰς Μύρρα τῆς Λυκίας	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that the travelers got off the ship at **Myra**. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “we came down to Myra of Lycia, where we got off the ship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
27:5	ni2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μύρρα τῆς Λυκίας	1	The word **Myra** is the name of a city, and the word **Lycia** is the name of the province in which that city was located. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:6	j4cf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πλοῖον Ἀλεξανδρῖνον, πλέον εἰς τὴν Ἰταλίαν	1	Luke is referring to what the crew of this ship was doing by association with the ship itself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a ship whose crew was sailing it to Italy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
27:6	fdq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀλεξανδρῖνον	1	The word **Alexandrian** is the name for someone or something that comes from the city of Alexandria. See how you translated it in [18:24](../18/24.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:7	zzw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἱκαναῖς δὲ ἡμέραις, βραδυπλοοῦντες καὶ μόλις, γενόμενοι κατὰ τὴν Κνίδον	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that the ship was **sailing slowly** and **with difficulty** because it was sailing into the wind. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “sailing slowly for many days and having arrived with difficulty near Cnidus because we were sailing into the wind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
27:7	pye5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὴν Κνίδον	1	The word **Cnidus** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:7	mq4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὴν Κρήτην & Σαλμώνην	1	The word **Crete** is the name of an island. See how you translated the word “Cretans” in [2:11](../02/11.md). The word **Salmone** is the name of a cape on the east end of the island of Crete. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:8	b604		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παραλεγόμενοι αὐτὴν	1	The pronoun **it** refers the island of Crete. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “sailing along the island of Crete” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
27:8	p4ri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μόλις	1	The implication is that even under the shelter of the island of Crete, the winds were still so strong as to make sailing to the west difficult. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “with difficulty because the winds from the west were strong even there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
27:8	a64y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Καλοὺς Λιμένας	1	The word **Fair Havens** is the name of a port on the south coast of the island of Crete. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:8	n7re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	πόλις ἦν Λασαία	1	The word **Lasea** is the name of a city on the coast of the island of Crete. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:9	a605		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ καὶ τὴν νηστείαν ἤδη παρεληλυθέναι	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that after this **fast**, which came in the last part of September or the first part of October according to Western calendars, there was a higher risk of seasonal storms. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “even the fast had already passed and so there was a higher risk of seasonal storms” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
27:9	u6x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν νηστείαν	1	Luke is referring to the Day of Atonement by association with the way that Jews observed a **fast** in connection with that sacred day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the Day of Atonement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
27:9	a606		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παρῄνει ὁ Παῦλος	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the centurion and to the pilot and owner of the ship, as verse 11 makes clear. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Paul was warning Julius and the pilot and the owner of the ship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
27:10	p29v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	θεωρῶ	1	Paul is speaking as if he could literally **see** the things he describes. He means that God has revealed them to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God has revealed to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
27:10	nx9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ ὕβρεως καὶ πολλῆς ζημίας, οὐ μόνον τοῦ φορτίου καὶ τοῦ πλοίου, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν, μέλλειν ἔσεσθαι τὸν πλοῦν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **injury** and **loss**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “on this voyage, many of us will be injured and we will lose many valuable things. We will not only lose the cargo and the ship, we will lose our lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
27:11	b1kz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ & ἑκατοντάρχης τῷ κυβερνήτῃ καὶ τῷ ναυκλήρῳ μᾶλλον ἐπείθετο, ἢ τοῖς ὑπὸ Παύλου λεγομένοις	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in other ways that are natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the pilot and the captain were persuading the centurion more by what they were saying than Paul was persuading him by what he was saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:11	a607		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ ναυκλήρῳ	1	Here the word **captain** could mean: (1) someone who was in command of the ship. Alternate translation: “the ship’s commander” (2) someone who owned the ship and was in command of it. However, while this is a common meaning of the word, it is unlikely in this context. We learn from the story that this ship was carrying grain from Egypt to Italy and so it would have belonged to the emperor’s own fleet. Alternate translation: “the shipowner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
27:12	jmi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λιμένος	1	A **harbor** is a place on the coast whose location and shape allow ships to come safely close to the land. If your language does not have a term for such a place, you could use a general description in your translation. Alternate translation: “place of access to the shore” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
27:12	z1lf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	παραχειμασίαν & παραχειμάσαι	1	The terms **wintering** and **to winter** mean to stay in a place that is safe during the winter, which is a cold and stormy season in this location. If the seasons do not vary much in your location or if there is not a cold and stormy season, you could explain this with a general expression. Alternate translation: “staying during a cold and stormy season … to stay there during the cold and stormy season” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
27:12	k2ti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Φοίνικα	1	The word **Phoenix** is the name of a port city on the south coast of Crete. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:12	a608		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	βλέποντα κατὰ λίβα καὶ κατὰ χῶρον	1	This expression means that the Phoenix harbor provided access for ships to sail out in the directions that the winds coming from the **southwest** and the **northwest** blew. That is, ships would sail out to the northeast and southeast from the harbor, and they would enter the harbor from the northeast or southeast. Your language and culture may have a comparable expression of its own that you can use in your translation. Otherwise, you could describe this in general terms. Alternate translation: “looking down the northwest wind and down the southwest wind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:12	x6vl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βλέποντα κατὰ λίβα καὶ κατὰ χῶρον	1	Luke is speaking as if the harbor of Phoenix was literally **looking** in these directions. He means that it gave access for ships to sail in those directions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “giving access for sailing to the northeast or to the southeast” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
27:12	gyd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λίβα & χῶρον	1	These directions are based on the rising and setting of the sun. The **southwest** is somewhat to the left of the setting sun, and the **northwest** is somewhat to the right of the setting sun. If you decide to use the terms “northeast” and “southeast” instead, based on the two previous notes, the northeast is somewhat to the left of the rising sun and the southeast is somewhat to the right of the rising sun. Your language and culture may have their own terms for these directions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
27:13	xx67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἄραντες	1	An **anchor** is a heavy object that is attached to a rope that is tied to a ship. The ship’s crew tosses the anchor into the water and it sinks to the bottom of the sea, keeping the ship from drifting about. The crew raises the anchor out of the water when it is time for the ship to travel. Your language may have a specific expression for this action. Alternate translation: “having weighed anchor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
27:13	a603		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παρελέγοντο	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the crew of the ship. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the crew was sailing the ship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
27:14	m2xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μετ’ οὐ πολὺ	1	Luke is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “after a short time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
27:14	g1ek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	ὁ καλούμενος Εὐρακύλων	1	The term **Euraklyon** is a combination of the Greek word for the east wind and the Latin word for the north wind. Luke spells out the term using Greek letters so that his readers will know how it sounds. This seems to be the name that Luke heard the sailors give to this wind. In your translation, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language. You could also say what it means. Alternate translation: “called the Northeaster” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
27:14	lrs7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ καλούμενος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that the sailors called” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:14	tz2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῆς	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the island of Crete. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the island of Crete” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
27:15	a609		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συναρπασθέντος δὲ τοῦ πλοίου, καὶ μὴ δυναμένου ἀντοφθαλμεῖν τῷ ἀνέμῳ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when the wind seized the ship, so that we were not able to face into the wind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:15	a610		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	συναρπασθέντος & τοῦ πλοίου, καὶ μὴ δυναμένου ἀντοφθαλμεῖν τῷ ἀνέμῳ	1	Luke is speaking of the **wind** as if it were a living thing that **seized** the **ship**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with the wind blowing with such force that it kept the ship from sailing in the direction from which it was coming” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
27:15	a611		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀντοφθαλμεῖν τῷ ἀνέμῳ	1	Luke is speaking as if the ship literally had a **face** that it could turn towards the wind. Your language may have an expression that suits this context and that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to bear up against the wind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
27:15	w1hl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐφερόμεθα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the wind drove us along” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:16	c4cg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	νησίον & τι ὑποδραμόντες, καλούμενον Καῦδα	1	The expression **running under** is a sailing term that means to go along a specific side of some land in order to block the wind. Your language may have a specific expression for this action. If not, you could explain the meaning generally. Alternate translation: “sailing under the lee of a certain island called Cauda” or “sailing on the side of an island called Cauda where the wind was not so strong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:16	a612		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	νησίον & τι & καλούμενον Καῦδα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “a certain island that people called Cauda” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:16	aq56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Καῦδα	1	The word **Cauda** is the name of a small island located off the south coast of Crete. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:16	h9z2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῆς σκάφης	1	A **lifeboat** is a smaller boat that crews sometimes tow behind their larger ship and sometimes bring up onto the ship and tie down. They use the smaller boat for various reasons, including escaping from the larger ship if it is sinking. If your language does not have a term for a smaller boat like this, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “of the smaller utility boat that the ship was towing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
27:17	tx1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	βοηθείαις ἐχρῶντο, ὑποζωννύντες τὸ πλοῖον	1	The word **helps** is a nautical term that means ropes or cables. The word **undergirding** describes the process of running ropes or cables around the bottom of a ship so that the ship will not come apart during a storm. If your language does not have comparable nautical terms, you could state the meaning plainly in your translation. Alternate translation: “they were tying ropes around the bottom of the ship so that it would not come apart during the storm” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:17	a613		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐχρῶντο	1	Here and in the next two verses, the pronoun **they** refers to the sailors of the ship. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the sailors were using” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
27:17	a614		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μὴ εἰς τὴν Σύρτιν ἐκπέσωσιν	1	The expression **fall into** is a nautical term that in this context describes a ship becoming stuck in quicksand. If your language does not have a comparable nautical term, you could state the meaning plainly in your translation. Alternate translation: “they might run aground on the Syrtis” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:17	dvv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὴν Σύρτιν	1	The word **Syrtis** is the name of a large mass of quicksand near the north coast of Africa. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
27:17	l615		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν Σύρτιν	1	Quicksand, which the word **Syrtis** describes, is sand that is saturated with water. It does not support the weight of a person, so sailors cannot get out of a ship to free it if the ship gets stuck in quicksand. If your readers would not be familiar with quicksand, you could describe it generally in your translation. Alternate translation: “the large mass of waterlogged sand off the north coast of Africa” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
27:17	l8kl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	χαλάσαντες τὸ σκεῦος	1	The term **gear** could mean: (1) the sails of the ship and the rigging that the sailors uses to raise and lower the sails. If this is the meaning, then Luke is saying that without sails, the sailors could not steer the ship and it had to go wherever the wind drove it. Alternate translation: “taking down the sails” (2) a sea anchor, that is, some object that the sailors would drag along in the water behind the ship in order to slow the ship down. If this is the meaning, then the sailors lowered this sea anchor in the hopes that the storm would end before they reached the quicksand. Alternate translation: “putting a sea anchor into the water” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
27:17	g7rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐφέροντο	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the wind was driving them along” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:18	fx4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σφοδρῶς & χειμαζομένων ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as the storm was tossing us exceedingly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
27:18	nd5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκβολὴν ἐποιοῦντο	1	The word **jettison** is a nautical term that describes sailors throwing the cargo of a ship (the goods that the ship is transporting) into the sea to lighten the weight of the ship in an effort to prevent it from sinking. If your language does not have a comparable nautical term, you could state the meaning plainly in your translation. Alternate translation: “they were throwing the cargo of the ship into the sea to make the ship lighter to try to keep it from sinking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:19	l617		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῇ τρίτῃ	1	In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the “third day.” So here, **the third day** means two days after the sailors tied ropes around the ship and one day after the sailors threw the cargo overboard. You may wish to express this in your translation in the way your own culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “on the day after that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
27:19	a641		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τῇ τρίτῃ	1	If you retain this idiom but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “on day three” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
27:19	vm2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν σκευὴν τοῦ πλοίου ἔριψαν	1	Luke assumes that his readers will understand that the sailors **threw the equipment … overboard** in a desperate effort to make the ship even lighter. In this context, **equipment** refers to everything the sailors needed to sail the ship: tackle, hoists, beams of wood, block and tackle, ropes, lines, sails, and the like.
