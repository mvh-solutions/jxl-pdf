2:1	con5			shame	1	the feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way
2:1	sjyf			talked with God	1	The word for **talk** should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.
2:2	s5fb			a snake	1	This refers to an elongated, legless creature that now moves by wiggling on its belly. Although later on in the story it is revealed that Satan spoke through the snake, this should not be said here in this frame.

2:2	y9sm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?	1	This is a rhetorical question. The snake asked the woman whether God actually said not to eat from any of the trees in the garden. But he was only pretending that he didn’t know what God had said because he wanted to create doubt in the woman’s mind. He wanted her to question God’s goodness.
2:2	o0ol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	you	1	If your language has different words for **you** depending on the number of people intended, use the plural form. God had given this command to both the man and the woman.

2:3	wgfj			you will die	1	Use your ordinary word for death, for a person’s physical life to end. Don’t avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh.
2:4	vja6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	The snake responded to the woman, “That is not true! You will not die. God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God and will understand good and evil like he does.”	1	This is direct quotation. It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “The snake responded to the woman that this was not true! They would not die. God just knew that as soon as they ate it, they would be like God and would understand good and evil like he does.”

God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will be like God	1	If your language has different words for **you** depending on the number of people intended, use the plural form. Satan was speaking about what would happen to both the man and the woman.

2:4	papn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	good and evil	1	This is a merism. **Good** and **evil** are two extremes that represent everything in between them. Satan is saying that they would understand everthing about what is right and wrong.
2:5	nslb			wise	1	The woman wanted to have insight and understanding like the snake seemed to have, and like God has.
2:5	p91r			who was with her	1	This is important information because it shows that the man was present when the woman made the decision to eat the fruit.

2:6	r99s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	They tried to cover their bodies	1	The man and the woman tried to cover their bodies in order to hide from God because they were ashamed that they were naked.

2:7	xro8			God walking	1	It seems that God regularly came to the garden to walk and talk with the man and the woman. We do not know what this looked like. If it is possible, it is best to use the same word that would be used to talk about a person walking.
2:7	fe8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	Then God called to the man, “Where are you?”	1	This is direct quotation. It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “Then God called to the man and asked him where he was.”

It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “Then God asked who told Adam, that he were naked, and it he had eaten the fruit that God told him not to eat.”
2:8	pt3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Who told you that you were naked?	1	Or, “How did you find out that you were naked?” God already knows the answer to all of his questions. By asking this question and the following question, he was giving Adam the opportunity to admit his sin of disobedience. Being naked was not a sin. God created them that way. Their knowledge of their nakedness was the problem. Their shame showed that they had sinned.
2:8	sxm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?	1	This is a rhetorical question. God already knew that Adam had eaten the fruit that God had told him not to eat. This can be translated as: a statement: “You ate the fruit that I told you not to eat!”

2:8	vapd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?”	1	This is direct quotation. It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “Then God asked the woman what she had done.”
2:8	w2ln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	What have you done?	1	Or, “Why have you done this?” God already knew the answer to this question. By asking this question, he was giving the woman the opportunity to admit her guilt. He was also implying that she should not have done what she did.
2:8	w9bi			The snake tricked me	1	The snake deceived or misled her. He lied to her. Don’t use a word that indicates that he cast a spell on her or bewitched her. The woman blamed the snake rather than confessing her disobedience and accepting responsibility for disobeying God.
2:9	k8av			You are cursed!	1	This could also be translated as: “I curse you!” or “Great harm will come to you.” Do not use a word that implies magic.
2:9	gklw			will hate each other	1	The woman would hate the snake and the snake would hate the woman. The women’s descendants would also hate the snake’s descendants, and the snake’s descendants would hate them.

2:9	rz9x			will crush your head	1	The descendant of the woman will destroy the descendant of the snake.

2:12	jqaw			like us by knowing good and evil	1	Here, this phrase points to a new way that Adam and Eve would be like God. Because they had sinned, they were aware of evil and could experience it. You could say: “because now they knew both good and evil.”
2:12	qg82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	like us	1	The Bible teaches that there is one God, but the Old Testament word ‘God’ is a plural form, and God uses plural pronouns when speaking to himself. Some understand this as a special way of speaking that expresses God’s majesty, and others understand this as God the Father speaking to the Son and the Spirit, who are all God.
2:12	ay4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	good and evil	1	This is a merism. **Good** and **evil** are two extremes that represent everything in between them. God is saying that they would understand everything about what is right and wrong.

11:4	fhjn			every firstborn son	1	This means every firstborn son of families who had not made the blood sacrifice, that is, the Egyptians. To make this clear you may want to add: “Every Egyptian firstborn son” (since all the Israelite families had put the blood on their doorposts).

11:7	njr2			from the firstborn of the prisoner in jail to the firstborn of Pharaoh	1	This is a way of saying that everyone’s firstborn son died–from the son of the least important person to the son of the most important person, and everyone in between.

Some languages may not have this same expression, and will express the meaning in a direct way.
12:3	sctb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	So they	1	The connecting word **So** connects the result (the Egyptians chased after the Israelites), with the reason (the Egyptians wanted the Israelites to be their slaves again).

12:5	kun4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	Stop being afraid!	1	This is both a command and also an exclamation. Moses was telling the people in very strong terms that they were wrong to be afraid, rather than trusting God to protect them.

21:12	ls7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	even though he had not done anything wrong	1	The connecting words **even though** contrast the way the Messiah was killed, with his innocence. It is not expected that an innocent, sinless man would be killed so brutally.
21:13	yg61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	But he would die	1	The connecting word **But** contrasts the perfection of the Messiah, with his death as punishment for other people’s sins. It is not expected that a perfect man would die for other people’s sin.
21:14	qq6w			raise the Messiah from the dead	1	This could mean ‘cause the Messiah to be alive again.’
21:14	gsfi			to make the New Covenant	1	This could mean ‘to put the New Covenant into effect.’
21:15	n5mx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	but the Messiah did not come during the time of any of those prophets	1	The connecting word **But** contrasts the many prophecies about the Messiah given to the prophets with the Messiah not coming during their life time.

21:15	ackx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	More than 400 years after the last of these prophecies was given, at exactly the right time	1	This is background information about what happened before the Messiah came.
21:15	g1z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	400 years	1	This could also be written in words: “four hundred years.”
21:15	cxtn			into the world	1	This could be translated as: “to the people of the world.” The Messiah would be sent not only to the Jews, but to all people.
22:0	oodf	title		The Birth of John	1	This title can also be translated as: “About how John the Baptist was born” or “What happened when John the Baptist was born?”
22:1	hq71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	In the past, God had spoken to his prophets so they could speak to his people.

22:1	d3xk			his people	1	This could be translated as: “his people, the Israelites” or “his people, the Jews.” But only include the added information if it is not clearly understood who these people were.
22:1	kkqn			Then came 400 years of silence	1	Other ways to say this are: “Then 400 years of silence passed” or “Then there were 400 years of silence.” The last Old Testament prophet, Malachi, has prophesied 400 years before.
22:1	z1os			in which he did not speak to men	1	This could mean ‘during which God did not give any messages to the prophets for his people.’
22:1	idof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	Then God sent an angel	1	This introduces the birth of John the Baptist as a new event.

22:2	ce95			You will name him John.	1	This is a command. The angel is telling Zechariah exactly what he must name John.
22:2	cxuz			fill him with the Holy Spirit	1	This could mean ‘give him wisdom and power through the Holy Spirit.’
22:2	iblz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	My wife and I are too old to have children!	1	This sentence emphasizes that Zechariah and Elizabeth were far too old to have children by natural means. That would require God to work a miracle.
22:2	t4pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	How can I know you are telling me the truth?	1	Here, **know** means to learn by experience, suggesting Zechariah was asking for a sign as proof. Alternate translation: “What can you do to prove to me that this will happen?”
22:3	eooy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	The angel responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news. Because you did not believe me, you will not be able to speak until the child is born.”	1	This is direct quotation. It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “The angel answered and told Zechariah that he was sent by God to bring him this good news. But because Zechariah did not believe him, Zechariah will not be able to speak until the child was born.”
22:3	b7yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	Immediately, Zechariah was unable to speak	1	The connecting word **Immediately** introduces a sequential clause. First the angel said Zechariah would not be able to speak, and the next thing that happened was Zechariah could not speak.

22:4	ort1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	When Elizabeth was six months pregnant	1	The connecting word **When** introduces a background clause. The main event is Mary’s pregnancy and visit to Elizabeth. The background event that was already happening is Elizabeth was six months pregnant.

22:4	kn2r			six months pregnant	1	Either she had already been pregnant for six months or she was in the sixth month of her pregnancy.
22:4	rww0			pregnant	1	Different languages have different idioms to talk about pregnancy, such as ‘she was with child’ or ‘she had one in her body’ or ‘she had belly.’ Some languages have special ways of speaking about it politely, such as ‘she was expecting.’ Use an expression that will not be embarrassing to readers.
22:4	wxmv			Elizabeth’s relative	1	Many translations say, ‘cousin’ here but we don’t know exactly how these two women were related. A general term like, ‘kin’ or ‘cousin’ could be used.

22:4	hy5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Son of the Most High God	1	This is an important title for Jesus. Mary will bear **a son** who will be called **the Son of the Most High**. Jesus is therefore a human son born of a human mother, and he is also the Son of God. These terms should be translated very carefully.
22:5	l109		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	Mary replied, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?”	1	This is direct quotation. It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “Mary asked him how this could be, since she was a virgin.”
22:5	mim9			How can this be	1	This could mean ‘How can I become pregnant’ Mary was not doubting the truth of the angel’s words, but asking how it would happen.
22:5	j2gw			Holy Spirit will come to you, and the power of God will come to you	1	These are two ways of saying the same thing: ‘By the power of God, the Holy Spirit will miraculously cause you to become pregnant.’ Make sure the translation of this sentence does not sound like there was any physical contact involved. This was a miracle.
22:5	tjbm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Holy Spirit	1	This introduces the Holy Spirit as a new character.
22:5	bs4y			the baby will be holy	1	The word **holy** here means the baby will belong to God.
22:5	djrq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Son of God	1	This is an important title for Jesus.
22:6	qvbm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	Soon after this happened	1	The connecting word **Soon** introduces a sequential clause. The angel came to Mary and soon after Mary left to visit Elizabeth.

22:6	yzcw			what God had done for them	1	This refers to the fact that both women were pregnant through God’s supernatural intervention. Mary had conceived without a man, and Elizabeth had conceived with Zechariah after she was past the age of childbearing.
22:7	lx1z			Elizabeth	1	See the note about Elizabeth on [22:04](22/04).
22:7	tra4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	Then God made Zechariah able to speak again	1	The connecting word **Then** introduces a sequential clause. After Zechariah and Elizabeth named their baby John, Zechariah was able to speak again.

22:7	w4g5			Praise God	1	This could mean ‘We should all praise God.’
22:7	zejp			the prophet	1	This could mean ‘the very important prophet.’ John would be the prophet that the Old Testament prophets had predicted would come before the Messiah.
22:7	tf6j			the Most High God	1	Other ways to say this are: “the God who is greater than everything” or “the God who rules over everything.”
22:7	kl0g			A Bible story from	1	These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
23:0	o27j	title		The Birth of Jesus	1	This title can also be translated as: “About how Jesus was born” or “What happened when Jesus was born?”

23:1	kdu5			he knew it was not his baby	1	This could mean ‘he knew that he was not the one who had caused her to be pregnant.’
23:1	x7dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	However, he did not want to shame Mary	1	The connecting word **However** contrasts Mary being pregnant with what Joseph believed to be another man’s child, with Joseph’s desire not to shame Mary. You would expect Joseph to be angry and want to shame her but, instead, he responds with mercy.
23:1	bk8d			to shame Mary	1	This could mean ‘to cause Mary to be publicly disgraced’ or ‘to embarrass Mary publicly.’ Joseph was merciful to Mary even though it seemed like she was an adulteress.
23:1	bz3f			to divorce her quietly	1	This could also be translated as: “to divorce her without telling others why,” or “to divorce her without telling others about her pregnancy.” Because Joseph was righteous, he wanted to resolve the situation in the best way possible, which in this culture would be to divorce her quietly.
23:1	r4v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	divorce her	1	Joseph had not married Mary yet, but when a man and woman promised to marry each other, Jews considered them husband and wife though they did not live together. This is why a divorce was necessary rather than simply breaking an engagement. For some languages, it may be better to say: “break their engagement.”
23:1	e1q9			in a dream	1	This could mean ‘while he was asleep and dreaming.’
23:2	uzjl			do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife	1	This can also be translated as: “Stop thinking that you shouldn’t marry Mary” or “Do not hesitate to have Mary as your wife.”

23:2	y1e0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	because he will save the people from their sins	1	The connecting word **because** connects the result (Joseph was to name the baby Jesus, which means God saves), with the reason (Jesus will save the people from their sins).
23:3	flmf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	So Joseph married Mary	1	The connecting word **So** connects the result (Joseph took Mary as his wife) with the reason (the angel told him the baby was not another man’s child conceived in sin, but the Son of God conceived by the Holy Spirit).
23:3	ezir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	but he did not sleep with her	1	The connecting word **but** contrasts Joseph taking Mary to be his wife, with him not sleeping with her. It would be expected that a man would sleep with the woman he took as his wife, but Joseph did the unexpected.
23:3	s2ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	he did not sleep with her	1	He kept her a virgin until the birth of the baby. In order to be polite, a euphemism is used to say Joseph did not have sexual intercourse with Mary. Alternate translation: “he did not have sexual relations with her”
23:4	zxts			When the time was near for Mary to give birth	1	This could mean ‘When it was near the end of Mary’s pregnancy.’
23:4	ounp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	They had to go there because the Roman officials wanted to count all the people in the land of Israel. They wanted everyone to go to where their ancestors had lived. King David had been born in Bethlehem, and he was the ancestor of both Mary and Joseph.	1	This is background information about why Joseph and Mary had to travel to Bethlehem.
23:4	e87w			the Roman officials	1	Rome had conquered and ruled over Israel at this time.
23:4	wf0i			to count all the people	1	This could mean ‘to write their names on a list.’ They probably did this so they could tax the people.
23:5	lzov		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	but there was no place for them to stay	1	This is background information about why Jesus was born in a place where animals slept.
23:5	jjt6			no place for them to stay	1	This could mean ‘no usual place for them to stay.’ Because Bethlehem was so crowded at that time, the usual rooms for guests were already full of people.
23:5	xjn1			where some animals were kept	1	This was a place for sheltering animals, not a place where people lived. Translate this with a term that would normally be used for a place where animals were kept.
23:5	qhwl			a feeding trough	1	This could mean ‘an animal feed box’ or ‘a wooden or stone box for feeding animals.’ The box could have been filled with hay to provide a padded surface for the baby to lie on.
23:6	q2l7			guarding their flocks	1	A **flock** is a group of sheep. The shepherds were caring for their sheep, and protecting them from harm or theft.
23:6	fzt3			a shining angel	1	This could also be translated as: “an angel surrounded by a bright light.” The shining light would have seemed even brighter in contrast to the darkness of the night.
23:6	qup1			they were terrified	1	The shepherds were very afraid when a supernatural angel appeared.
23:6	vspr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	The angel said, “Do not be afraid, because I have some good news for you. The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Bethlehem!”	1	This is direct quotation. It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “The angel told them not to be afraid, because he had some good news for them. The Messiah, the Master, had been born in Bethlehem!”
23:6	p5md			Do not be afraid	1	This often means ‘stop being afraid.’ The angel spoke this command to the shepherds in order to comfort them. The shepherds were very afraid when they saw the angel, so he was telling them they did not need to be afraid. Alternate translation: “You do not need to be afraid”
23:6	nx18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	The Messiah, the Master, has been born in Bethlehem!	1	This sentence emphasizes the exciting message that the Messiah—for whom the Israelites had so long been waiting—had finally come!

After they go and search for the baby, they will find him wrapped in cloth and lying in a trough.
23:7	xt21			wrapped in pieces of cloth	1	The custom of that time was to tightly wrap newborn babies in long strips of cloth. It may be necessary to say “wrapped in long strips of cloth, in the customary way.”
23:7	gcvy			a feeding trough	1	This could mean ‘an animal feeding box.’ Also see how you translated this in [23:05](23/05).
23:7	jyml			filled with angels	1	This means that there were so many angels that they seemed to fill the sky.
23:7	w5pc			May all honor be to God	1	This can also be translated as: “Let us all honor God!” or “Our God deserves all honor!” or “We all give honor to God!”
23:7	tr99			peace on earth	1	Another way to say this would be: “may there be peace on earth.”
23:7	hwzk			the people he favors	1	This might be translated as: “people that God looks upon with favor, delight, or good will.”
23:8	g7dn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	Then the angels left	1	The connecting word **Then** introduces a sequential clause. The angels gave their praise, and then they left.
23:8	wbas			everything they had heard and seen	1	This included the glorious angels and their amazing message, as well as seeing the newborn Messiah himself.

23:9	rlyb			the house	1	They were no longer staying in the place for animals where he was born.
23:10	w77n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	When these men saw Jesus with his mother	1	The connecting word **When** introduces a simultaneous clause. When they saw Jesus, the wisemen bowed down and worshiped. It was their simultaneous response to seeing him.
23:10	nyf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	bowed down	1	This could mean ‘bowed low to the ground.’ At that time, this was the customary way of showing great respect or reverence.

24:1	mo72			the wilderness	1	This could mean ‘the desert’ or ‘a remote, desert-like place.’ There were few people living out in this area.
24:1	e4bo			wild honey	1	This honey was the natural product of bees in the wilderness; it was not cultivated by people. If that is what people would understand by the word **honey**, you may not need to call it **wild**.
24:1	r8yl			locusts	1	These were large, hopping insects with wings, like very large grasshoppers. Some people who live in the desert eat them.
24:1	oa4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	wore clothes made from camel hair	1	This clothing symbolizes that John was a prophet like the prophets from long ago, especially the prophet Elijah.
24:1	mijm			clothes made from camel hair	1	This could mean ‘coarse clothes made of camel hair.’ These clothes would not quickly wear out in the wilderness as other clothes would.
24:1	aak2			camel hair	1	A camel is an animal that has very rough hair. People could make clothing out of it. This could be translated as: “rough animal hair.”
24:2	i34y			the wilderness	1	See how you translated this word in [24:01](24/01).
24:2	epol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	He preached to them, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of God is near!”	1	This is direct quotation. It can also be stated as an indirect quotation: “He preached to them, telling them to repent, for the kingdom of God was near!”

Alternate translation: “God has his axe and he is ready to cut down and burn any tree that grows bad fruit” or “As a person gets his axe ready to cut down and burn a tree that grows bad fruit, God is ready to punish you for your sins”
24:4	f950			God will cut down every tree that does not bear good fruit, and he will throw them into the fire	1	This means: ‘He will judge them person who does not do good deeds and punish them.’
24:4	p5u7			every tree that does not bear good fruit	1	John is not really talking about trees. This is an expression that compares good fruit to good actions and attitudes that come from God.
24:4	p86n			John fulfilled what the prophets had said, “See, I will soon send my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.”	1	In some languages it would be more natural to use an indirect quote for this sentence, such as: John fulfilled what the prophets had said. They told of God’s promise to send his messenger ahead of Jesus to prepare his way.

24:6	fmul			There is	1	For some languages, this would be translated as: “Here is” or “That man is.”
24:6	pjk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the Lamb of God	1	John speaks of Jesus as if Jesus is a lamb from God. This is a metaphor that represents God’s perfect sacrifice. Jesus is called the “Lamb of God” because he was sacrificed to pay for people’s sins.

24:6	hd65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	world	1	The word **world** is a metonym and refers to all the people in the world. Alternate translation: “all the people in the world” or “every person in the world”

38:14	dkvu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	are you betraying me with a kiss?	1	This could mean ‘are you really going to betray me with a kiss?’ Jesus is not looking for an answer to this question, so some languages would translate it as a statement, such as: “you are betraying me by kissing me!” or “you make your betrayal even worse by kissing me!”
