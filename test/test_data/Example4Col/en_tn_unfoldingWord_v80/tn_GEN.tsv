He begins with how he created everything from nothing, including the earth and all the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, stars), all the plants and animals, and especially how he created human beings in his image to be in a relationship with him. This book also explains how sin and death came into the world and what God’s plan is to save people from that. In fact, all the important teachings in the Bible begin in Genesis. That makes this book **foundational** and important for everyone so that they can know and understand the truth about God and his plan for their lives.\n\nBeginning with verse 1, the book of Genesis is a **narrative** that tells the history of events that actually happened. This is confirmed by the fact that the conjunctions and the forms of the verbs that are used in the Hebrew text reflect the Hebrew narrative style, which is used to narrate historical accounts. In the same way, those who translate the book of Genesis should also use grammatical structures in their languages that are used for true, historical narratives. God uses narrative, which is one of the most interesting styles of communication, to not only tell people about the events in the early history of the world, but also to teach them about himself and about the way he interacts with people as their loving Creator.\n\nGenesis provides the **vital context** for the rest of God’s Word, especially the gospel message about Jesus, and so it helps people to understand their need for him to be their Savior. In fact, without Genesis, it would not be clear why everyone needs to trust in Jesus as the only one who can save them from sin and its consequences, so that they can associate with God and be part of his eternal family.\n\nIn light of all that, Genesis should be one of the first books of the Bible that is translated into every language that needs a translation. May God guide and bless you and your translation team as you undertake this important task together by his power.\n\n### Author and date of writing\n\nMoses was the human author of the first five books of the Bible, including the book of Genesis (Exodus 24:3-4; Deuteronomy 31:9, 24; John 1:45). The Holy Spirit is the one who inspired what Moses wrote in those books (2 Peter 1:21), so ultimately God is the author, and these books are part of his Message to mankind. Those five books are sometimes referred to as the Torah (a Hebrew word that means “teaching,” “instruction,” or “law”) or the Pentateuch (a Greek word that means “five books”). In the New Testament this set of books is also referred to as “the Law” (John 1:45) or “the Law of Moses” (Acts 28:23), and Jesus himself affirmed that Moses wrote them (John 5:46-47; 7:23).\n\nMoses was born in the country of Egypt around 1526 B.C. (Exodus 2:1-10). According to the genealogies in Genesis, his birth was about 1,000 years after the Flood (which was about 1,650 years after creation). Moses may have written much of the Pentateuch during the forty years that he led the people of Israel as they wandered in the wilderness (around 1446 B.C.—1406 B.C.).\n\nThe very first verse in Genesis assumes that God (the author guiding the human author) has always existed and that he has no beginning and no end (also see Genesis 21:33; Deuteronomy 33:27; Psalm 90:2). He uses his personal name “Yahweh” for the first time in Genesis 2:4. The name “Yahweh” means “he is” and indicates that God is eternal. His name also means that he is unchanging and that he is always present.\n\n### Book outline\n\nIn all, Genesis covers a span of about 2200 years of history. After the world’s early history, the rest of Genesis tells about the ancestors of God’s people, with special focus on Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (and their families). Genealogies are an important part of what ties the book together from beginning to end.\n\nThe following outline shows these two main divisions in the book of Genesis: (1) Early World History, and (2) The History about the Ancestors of God’s Chosen People. Those two divisions each have roughly four main subdivisions, which are based on four key events (in the first division) and four key ancestors (in the second division). Some scholars prefer to divide the book up into ten divisions that are introduced by the Hebrew phrase that means “these are the generations of...” In the outline below, **asterisks** mark the sections that contain that phrase. The phrase is found in Genesis 2:4 (heavens and earth), 5:1 (Adam), 6:9 (Noah), 10:1, 32 (sons of Noah), 11:10 (Shem), 11:27 (Terah), 25:12 (Ishmael), 25:19 (Isaac),  36:1, 9 (Esau), and 37:2 (Jacob).\n\n**Bolded words** in the outline show which sections contain promises and covenants from God and also mark who the main ancestors were in the various sub-divisions.\n\n#### Division 1: Early World History\n\nCreation\n- God creates the universe and everything in it (1:1-2:3)\n- Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden (2:4-25)\\*\n\nThe Fall\n- The first sin and God’s judgment;

Many translations use a special format to identify these passages as poetry by indenting each clause on a new line. Many other translations do not do this, but rather use regular paragraph formatting everywhere, including for poetry. It may be helpful to look at a translation in the national language of your country that uses poetry formatting, to help you decide whether or not you want to do something similar in your translation. Some translations put some of the following passages in poetry format since these verses have certain features of poetry such as parallelisms and metaphors: Genesis 1:27; 2:23; 3:14-16, 17b-19; 4:23-24; 8:22; 9:6, 25-27; 12:2-3; 14:19-20; 15:1; 16:11-12; 24:60; 25:23; 27:27-29, 39-40; 48:15-16, 20; 49:1-27. You may not want to put all these passages in poetry format since some of them have parallelisms that are not necessarily poetry but may just be emphasizing certain events in the narrative or certain points in a prophecy.\n\n
1:intro	zb6f				0	### Possible titles for this book:\n\n\n- “Genesis”\n- “The Book of Genesis”\n- “Genesis: The First Book By Moses”\n- “Genesis: The Book About Beginnings”\n- “The First Book That God's Prophet/Spokesman Moses Wrote: Genesis”\n\n\nThe English title “Genesis” is a transliteration of a Greek word that means “origin” or “beginning” or “birth”; the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures (the Septuagint) uses this word for the first time in Genesis 2:4. The Hebrew title of this book בְּרֵאשִׁית (pronounced “bereshith”) is the first Hebrew word in verse 1 and literally means “In the beginning.” The Latin translation of the Bible (the Latin Vulgate) was the first translation to use the title “The Book of Genesis.” Since that time, many other translations include “Genesis” in the book title because people are familiar with that name. Sometimes as part of the title, translators also include the fact that Moses was the author and that he was inspired by God. Do what is best in your language.
1:1	uiu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠רֵאשִׁ֖ית	1	“At the beginning {of time/everything}” or “{This is how everything} began:” The first chapter of Genesis is a true historical narrative (which is indicated by the Hebrew language structures that are used throughout the chapter), and verse 1 records the first event in that history. This is confirmed by the wider context of the Scriptures, which teach us that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3). Some languages must use a verb (“began”) in verse 1 rather than an abstract noun (“beginning”). Do what is best in your language.
1:1	b730		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Translate the title “God” in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed.
1:1	hmtj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	בָּרָ֣א	1	“made”. In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter 1 is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing.
1:1	bcu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֵ֥ת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יִם	1	“the sky”. This phrase refers here to the region where all the stars and planets would later exist. Keep that in mind as you translate this term.
1:1	wgq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וְ⁠אֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	This phrase refers to the planet earth.
1:2	qfra			וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ	1	“Now {at first after that,} the earth” or “{At first after that,} the earth”. The author pauses here to describe what the earth and the heavens were like after God first created them (verse 1). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “the earth” in verse 1.
1:2	btmf			הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֨הוּ֙ וָ⁠בֹ֔הוּ	1	It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate,” or “did not have {its present} form, and there was nothing {living} on it {yet},” or (2) “completely empty/desolate,” which treats the text as a hendiadys. However, it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as they are in the Hebrew text).
1:2	f7a1			וְ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם	1	“It was {totally/completely} dark, there was deep {water} {everywhere},” or “There was deep {water} {everywhere} {that was covered/surrounded} in/by {complete/total} darkness,” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
1:2	rp8q			וְ⁠ר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “and God’s Spirit was hovering/moving” or (2) “and a wind from God was blowing” or (3) “and a powerful wind was blowing”. The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb “hovering” does not describe what wind does.
1:2	yq4r			עַל פְּנֵ֥י הַ⁠מָּֽיִם	1	“over the surface of the water.” or “above the waters/water.” Throughout this chapter, the word “waters” is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water”. Do what is best in your language in each context.
1:3	kxuq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“Then God commanded,” What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin.
1:3	o0zd			יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר	1	“Let light exist.” or “I command there to be light.” or “I command light to start shining!” This is a command, not a permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation point with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate “light” should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself.
1:3	nj3u			וַֽ⁠יְהִי אֽוֹר	1	“And/So {immediately} there was light.” or “And {so/immediately} light started shining.” Light began to shine immediately as a result of God’s command.
1:4	ceam		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as “And” or “Then” at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew uses conjunctions. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context.
1:4	bnvs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֶת הָ⁠א֖וֹר כִּי ט֑וֹב	1	“that the light {was} good/excellent.” In the Bible, “good” is an important theme. Throughout chapter 1, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was.
1:4	wtmd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as “God”) and pronouns (such as “he”) are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, “God” is repeated frequently in chapter 1 to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say “God” only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter 1, do what is best in your language each time that you refer to God.
1:4	q3jo			וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠א֖וֹר וּ⁠בֵ֥ין הַ⁠חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	“Then God/he separated/divided the light from the darkness {so that each had its own time}.” or “Then God/he caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time.” or “Then God/he separated the light from the darkness {so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours}.”
1:5	c9yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	“Then God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Some languages omit the connecting word “And” or “Then” here. Consider what is the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one.
1:5	cc8r			לָ⁠אוֹר֙ י֔וֹם	1	“the light Daytime,” Notice that in this context the word “Day” refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter 1, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created. Do what is best in your language.
1:5	if7a			וְ⁠לַ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה	1	“and the darkness he called/named Nighttime.” or “and he called/named the darkness Nighttime.” In the Hebrew text, “the darkness” is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider what is the best way to translate this clause in your language.
1:5	xxe6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	“Then evening came, and {then/later} morning came,” The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” and would fit well here.
1:5	xmx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד	1	“{and that was} day one.” or “{and that was} {the end of} the first day.” Here “day” refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (“one”) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second,” “third,” and so on) for the rest of the days of the creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one,” “day two,” and so on). Do what is best in your language.
1:6	nesq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.
1:6	gqae			יְהִ֥י רָקִ֖יעַ	1	“Let there be a large/vast space” or “I command there to be a {large/vast} expanse/space” or “I command a large/vast space to form/exist”. The Hebrew word for “expanse” here describes a large space that is “spread out.” It was not solid, but rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated “Let there be” in verse 3.
1:6	mscz			בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	“in the middle of the water,” See how you translated “waters” in verse 2.
1:6	c6kn			וִ⁠יהִ֣י מַבְדִּ֔יל בֵּ֥ין מַ֖יִם לָ⁠מָֽיִם	1	“and let it separate/divide the water {above it} from the water {below it}.” or “so that it separates/divides the waters/water into two separate/different places.”
1:7	i8t2			וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִים֮	1	“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verse 7 explains what God’s command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice.
1:7	dgya			אֶת הָ⁠רָקִיעַ֒	1	“a large/vast space”
1:7	c752			וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֗ל	1	“and divided” or “and used it to separate/divide”
1:7	pidk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בֵּ֤ין הַ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ מִ⁠תַּ֣חַת לָ⁠רָקִ֔יעַ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר מֵ⁠עַ֣ל לָ⁠רָקִ֑יעַ	1	“the water that {was} below the expanse/space from the water that {was} above it.” or “the water that {was} under/below it from the water that {was} above it.” For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (“it”) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places, and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language.
1:7	xfx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	“That is the way it happened.” or “Everything was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.”
1:8	igd0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	“God/He called/named” or “and God/he called/named”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here (with or without a conjunction) or to continue the sentence that began at the end of verse 7. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 5.
1:8	hh8a			לָֽ⁠רָקִ֖יעַ	1	“the large/vast space”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 7.
1:8	n336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	“Sky.” This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth’s surface where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse 1.
1:8	su1z			וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	“Then evening came, and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verse 5, and see the note about that there.
1:8	adzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שֵׁנִֽי	1	“{and that was} {the end of} the second day.” or “{and} the second day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day two.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number (“second”) here or a cardinal number (“two”).
1:9	yc3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verses 3 and 6.
1:9	yetc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִקָּו֨וּ הַ⁠מַּ֜יִם מִ⁠תַּ֤חַת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙	1	“Let the water {that is} under the heavens/sky gather/come together” or “I command the water {that is} below the heavens/sky to gather/come together”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb (“be gathered”) or an active form (“gather” or “come”).
1:9	as42			אֶל מָק֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	“in one place/area” or “into one area”
1:9	g8i2			וְ⁠תֵרָאֶ֖ה הַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁ֑ה	1	“so that there is dry ground/land.” or “so that dry ground/land can be seen.” or “so that land is uncovered and dries off.” The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate “dry ground” does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water.
1:9	gign			וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to be/happen}.” See how you translated this sentence in verse 7. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context.
1:10	eh2f			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	“Then God/he called/named”
1:10	khag			לַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁה֙	1	“the dry land” or “the ground/land that had dried off”
1:10	teai			אֶ֔רֶץ	1	“Ground,” This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as “earth” in verse 1, but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), and not to the entire planet.
1:10	c5av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְוֵ֥ה הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם קָרָ֣א	1	“and the waters/water that he had gathered together he called/named” or “and he called/named the gathered waters” or “and he called/named the waters/water that had gathered/come together”. See how you translated a sentence in verse 5 that is similar in structure to this sentence.
1:10	sb47			יַמִּ֑ים	1	“Oceans.” or “Sea/Ocean.” At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large land mass on the earth (as verse 9 indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as “Ocean” or “Sea”, could be used here in your translation.
1:10	gnuy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Decide whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4.
1:10	hk8y			כִּי טֽוֹב	1	“that {what he had made was} good/excellent.” or “that {the land and the seas/ocean were} good/excellent.” Some languages cannot use a pronoun (“it”) here, but have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the word “good” in verse 4, and see the note about that there.
1:11	jq0c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	“Then God commanded,”
1:11	lnyu			תַּֽדְשֵׁ֤א הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙ דֶּ֔שֶׁא	1	“I command the land/ground to grow/produce {green} plants,” or “The land/ground must now be covered with {green} plants,” The Hebrew word for “vegetation” refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse. Also, see how you translated “Land” in verse 10.
1:11	sdob			עֵ֚שֶׂב מַזְרִ֣יעַ זֶ֔רַע	1	“{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have seeds”. This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn, and wheat.
1:11	cv1n			עֵ֣ץ פְּרִ֞י עֹ֤שֶׂה פְּרִי֙ לְ⁠מִינ֔⁠וֹ	1	“{and} fruit trees that bear/produce fruit, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{and} {every kind/type of} fruit tree that bears/produces/has its own kind/type of fruit” or “{and} {all kinds/types of} fruit trees that bear/produce/have their own kind/type of fruit”. The phrase “according to its kind” emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds.
1:11	o8kh			אֲשֶׁ֥ר זַרְע⁠וֹ ב֖⁠וֹ	1	“that {has} seeds inside,” or “with seeds inside,” or “with its {own kind/type of} seeds inside it,”
1:11	k8cn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“throughout the earth.” or “all over the earth.” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “Let the land sprout vegetation on/throughout the earth …” Do what is best in your language.
1:11	virt			וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	“And that is {exactly} what happened:” or “And it/everything happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to happen}:” Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that verse 12 gives the details of what happened. This is different from verse 7, where the details of what happened come before “And it was so”, and from verse 9, where no additional details are given.
1:12	jikr			וַ⁠תּוֹצֵ֨א הָ⁠אָ֜רֶץ דֶּ֠שֶׁא	1	“The land sprouted/produced vegetation/plants,” or “The land started growing/producing {green} plants,” Verse 12 explains what God’s command in verse 11 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice.
1:12	rh5y			עֵ֣שֶׂב מַזְרִ֤יעַ זֶ֨רַע֙ לְ⁠מִינֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	“{including} plants that produce/have seeds, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds that grow into the same kind/type of plant,” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have their own kind/type of seeds,”
1:12	cy8d			וְ⁠עֵ֧ץ עֹֽשֶׂה פְּרִ֛י אֲשֶׁ֥ר זַרְע⁠וֹ ב֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠מִינֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	“and trees that bear/produce fruit with seeds inside, {each} according to its {own} kind.” or “and {every kind/type of} tree that produces/has fruit with seeds that grow into the same kind/type of tree.” or “and {all kinds/types of} trees that {produce/have} their own kind/type of seed-bearing fruit.”
1:12	o8er		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.
1:12	k58u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּי טֽוֹב	1	“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {all the plants and trees were} good/excellent.” See how you translated this clause in verse 10. Some languages have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language.
1:13	b3dy			וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	“Then evening came, and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verses 5 and 8.
1:13	xcdg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שְׁלִישִֽׁי	1	“{and that was} {the end of} the third day.” or “{and} the third day {ended}.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day three.”
1:14	h9x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	“Then God commanded,”
1:14	f6qj			יְהִ֤י מְאֹרֹת֙	1	“Let lights/lamps appear/exist” or “I command there to be sources of light” or “Let there be things/objects that give/shine light”. These lights refer to the sun, moon and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights.
1:14	snjr			בִּ⁠רְקִ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	“in the expanse/space of/called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. The expanse is the same thing as the heavens (verse 8), so some translations leave “the expanse of” implied here. Do what is best in your language.
1:14	as7i			לְ⁠הַבְדִּ֕יל	1	“to divide/distinguish” or “that separate/divide”
1:14	ik3v			בֵּ֥ין הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה	1	“the day{time} from the night{time}.” See how you translated “Day{time}” and “Night{time}” in verse 5.
1:14	iva1			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙	1	“Let those lights/lamps also be” or “They must/will also serve/function as” or “I also command those lights/lamps to serve/function as”
1:14	kwpn			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “signs/markers {of special/important events}, and {they must/will} mark” or “They must/will also mark/indicate when important things happen, and {they must/will} mark/show” or (2) “signs/markers that mark/indicate/show”. The word “signs” means that the lights are to mark certain times of the year. Following the first interpretation, the lights are to also mark special events (such as the star that signaled Jesus’ birth and the darkened sun at Jesus’ death).
1:14	zf63			וּ⁠לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים וּ⁠לְ⁠יָמִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁנִֽים	1	“seasons, days and years.” or “when seasons, days and years begin {and end}.” The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. Seasons are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis 8:22), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
1:15	qfvm			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לִ⁠מְאוֹרֹת֙	1	“And they must/will be sources of light” or “They must/will serve/function as lights” or “Their purpose is to serve/function as sources of light”
1:15	szsy			בִּ⁠רְקִ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	“in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 14.
1:15	jf98			לְ⁠הָאִ֖יר עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“to/that shine {light} on the earth.” or “so that they provide/give light to/for the earth.” See how you translated “the earth” in verses 1-2.
1:15	c4rf			וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.”
1:16	slgo			וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verses 16-18 explain what God’s commands in verses 14-15 caused to happen. Make sure your translation of these verses does not sound like he created the lights twice. See how you translated “So God made” in verse 7.
1:16	axyb			אֶת שְׁנֵ֥י הַ⁠מְּאֹרֹ֖ת הַ⁠גְּדֹלִ֑ים	1	“the two bright/big lights,” This phrase refers to the sun and the moon, which are the two brightest objects in the earth’s sky. However, the author intentionally does not use their names, so you should not include their names in your translation either.
1:16	udou			אֶת הַ⁠מָּא֤וֹר הַ⁠גָּדֹל֙	1	“the stronger/brighter light”. The focus is on the relative brightness or strength of the lights, not on their size.
1:16	vq3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לְ⁠מֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	“to dominate/govern the day,” or “to shine during the day,” The word “rule” is a figure of speech that means each light has the greatest effect during a particular time period because it is the brightest light that is shining then. For some languages, nonliving objects like the sun and the moon cannot “rule” because only people can do that. Do what is accurate and natural in your language.
1:16	slw4			וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠מָּא֤וֹר הַ⁠קָּטֹן֙	1	“and the weaker/dimmer light”
1:16	kas2			לְ⁠מֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת הַ⁠לַּ֔יְלָה	1	“to dominate/govern the night,” or “to shine during the night,” Be consistent here with how you translated “rule” previously in this verse.
1:16	vlll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֵ֖ת הַ⁠כּוֹכָבִֽים	1	“and {he also made/created} the stars.” or “{That is} also {when he made/created} the stars.” The verb “made” that is used earlier in the verse is implied here. Translate this in a way that is clear and natural in your language.
1:17	wi1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֥ן אֹתָ֛⁠ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“God/He placed/put them” or “God/He placed/put the lights”. Consider what is the best way in your language to refer to God and the lights at this point in the paragraph.
1:17	zkp6			בִּ⁠רְקִ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יִם	1	“in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 14 and 15.
1:17	e0pl			לְ⁠הָאִ֖יר עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“to shine light on the earth,” or “to provide/give light to/for the earth,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 15.
1:18	iq2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לִ⁠מְשֹׁל֙ בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם וּ⁠בַ⁠לַּ֔יְלָה	1	“and to govern/dominate the day{time} and/or the night{time},” or “and to shine during the day{time} and/or during the night{time},” Make sure that your translation of the word “day” refers here to the daytime hours, not an entire 24-hour day. Also see how you translated “rule” in 1:16.
1:18	x9y4			וּֽ⁠לֲ⁠הַבְדִּ֔יל בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠א֖וֹר וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠חֹ֑שֶׁךְ	1	“and to divide/distinguish the light from the darkness.” or “and to separate/distinguish the time of light from the time of darkness.” Consider again how you translated “separate” in verses 4, 6-7, 14 and 18.
1:18	ji6r			וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”

1:20	szof			וְ⁠עוֹף֙ יְעוֹפֵ֣ף	1	“and let there be birds that fly” or “I also command there to be birds that fly” or “Also let there be winged creatures that fly”. The Hebrew word for “birds” can also be more general and refer to “winged/flying creatures,” which includes birds, bats, flying insects and even flying reptiles that are now extinct. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
1:20	obps			עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ עַל פְּנֵ֖י רְקִ֥יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	“above the earth, through the sky/air.” or “across/in/through the sky above the earth.”

1:21	ywwv			אֶת הַ⁠תַּנִּינִ֖ם הַ⁠גְּדֹלִ֑ים	1	“the huge/gigantic sea/ocean animals”. These include whales, sharks, giant squid, crocodiles, and leviathans (Psalm 74:13-14, Isaiah 27:1), which were probably swimming reptiles that are now extinct.
1:21	uwve			וְ⁠אֵ֣ת כָּל נֶ֣פֶשׁ הַֽ⁠חַיָּ֣ה הָֽ⁠רֹמֶ֡שֶׂת	1	“and every {kind/type of fish and every other} creature/animal that moves/lives” or “and all the {fish and other} {kinds/types of} creatures/animals that move/live”

1:21	yks1			לְ⁠מִֽינֵ⁠הֶ֗ם	1	“{each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{each} that produces/has its own kind/type {of offspring/young},” This phrase emphasizes that each different kind of creature has its own distinct kind of offspring/young. For example, whales always give birth to whales, and never give birth to cats or cows or any other kind of creature.
1:21	w4mh			וְ⁠אֵ֣ת	2	“and {how he created/made}” or “{That is} also {how he created/made}”. For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, so that the previous sentence is not too long. Do what is best in your language.
1:21	ug9b			כָּל ע֤וֹף כָּנָף֙	1	“every {kind/type of} bird” or “all {the different kinds/types of} birds” or “every {kind/type of} winged creature”. See how you translated “birds” in verse 20.

1:22	yiar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“by saying {to them},” or “and said {first to the water animals},” God blesses the water animals first. If that is not clear, you could make that explicit here in the quote margin or at the beginning of what God says.

1:22	pfl8			אֶת הַ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙ בַּ⁠יַּמִּ֔ים	1	“the water in/of the sea/ocean” or “the ocean/water”. For some languages, “water in the seas” is too repetitive, so it is more natural here to just say “seas/sea” or “ocean” or “water”. Do what is best in your language.
1:22	wysn			וְ⁠הָ⁠ע֖וֹף יִ֥רֶב	1	“And the birds must/will {also} increase {greatly} in number” or “{You} birds must/will {also} become {very} numerous/many”.

1:24	wf0h			נֶ֤פֶשׁ חַיָּה֙	1	“{every kind/type of} living creature/animal” or “{all kinds/types of} creatures/animals,” This is a general term that refers to all the different kinds of creatures/animals that breathe, including the three large categories of animals mentioned below in this verse.
1:24	se25			לְ⁠מִינָ֔⁠הּ	1	“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} bearing/having its own kind/type of offspring/young,” This phrase means that every kind of animal that God created always produces young that are the same kind of animal as their parents. See how you translated this phrase in verse 21, and see the note about that there.
1:24	lpze			בְּהֵמָ֥ה	1	“{including} domestic/farm/tame animals,” This term probably includes animals such as horses, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats that people raise for food or use for farming or other work. This is in contrast to animals that normally live in the wild.

It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
1:25	ts6r			וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”

1:26	bpc0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“Then God said {to himself},” Here God is not commanding anything to happen, but is getting ready to personally create mankind himself (the details are given in Gen 2:7, 21-22). Some languages have to specify who is being spoken to. Do what is best in your language.
1:26	blpi			נַֽעֲשֶׂ֥ה	1	“{Now} we should/will make/create”. Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (“us” and “our”) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible.
1:26	bahl			אָדָ֛ם	1	“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. The Hebrew word for “man” is used here (and in verse 27) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including both male and female.
1:26	ulnl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	בְּ⁠צַלְמֵ֖⁠נוּ כִּ⁠דְמוּתֵ֑⁠נוּ	1	“to be like us and act like us,” or “to be like us, so that they are similar to us in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that God made mankind to be like himself in many ways.
1:26	mq1c			וְ⁠יִרְדּוּ֩	1	“and let us put them in charge/control of” or “We will give them authority to rule/oversee/manage”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
1:26	bgn6			בִ⁠דְגַ֨ת הַ⁠יָּ֜ם	1	“the fish of/in the sea/ocean,”
1:26	fiz0			וּ⁠בְ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם	1	“the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” Some translations leave out the phrase “of the sky” because it is strongly implied and may not sound natural in their languages. However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky.
1:26	qqil			וּ⁠בַ⁠בְּהֵמָה֙	1	“the domestic/farm/tame animals,” Consider again how you translated “livestock” in verses 24-26.
1:26	vthy			וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“and the entire earth,” This refers to the planet earth and everything on it, including water, soil, metals, minerals, and other resources, as well as all the plants and animals.
1:26	x3kc			וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל הָ⁠רֶ֖מֶשׂ הָֽ⁠רֹמֵ֥שׂ עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“including every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth.” or “and/including all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth.” For some languages it is not natural to repeat “and” or “over” with each item in this list. Consider what is the best way to translate a list like this in your language.
1:27	zl1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּבְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	“So God created/made”. In this verse God does what he said he was going to do (verse 26). Make sure your translation does not sound like God created mankind twice. Also see how you translated “created” in verses 1 and 21.
1:27	f5z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse 26.
1:27	yyg0			בְּ⁠צַלְמ֔⁠וֹ	1	“in his own image.” or “to be like himself.” or “to be similar to himself {in many ways}.” God made mankind to be like himself in some ways (not all ways) and to represent him in the world and show people what he is like. For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation. You could include some of that information in a footnote.
1:27	f9uj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠צֶ֥לֶם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בָּרָ֣א אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	“{Yes/Indeed,} he created/made them in his image” or “{Indeed} God/he created/made them to be like himself” or “{Yes,} God/he created/made them to be similar to himself {in many ways}”. The pronoun “him” refers to the collective noun “man”, which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person. Also, this clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of verse 27 in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God’s image that human beings were created. Do what is best in your language.
1:27	n054			זָכָ֥ר וּ⁠נְקֵבָ֖ה בָּרָ֥א אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	“He {also} created/made them {to be} male or female.” The phrase “male and female” comes first in the Hebrew text in order to emphasize it. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Also make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like God is both male and female.
1:28	n52a			וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֹתָ⁠ם֮ אֱלֹהִים֒	1	“Then God showed his favor to them” or “Then God caused them to prosper/flourish”. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 22.
1:28	mnzd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֜ם אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	“and said,” or “by saying to them,” or “by saying,” or “He said,” Make sure it is clear in your translation of this quote margin that what God says next is the way that he blessed mankind, not something he said separately from that.
1:28	lyey			פְּר֥וּ	1	“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children”. See how you translated “Be fruitful and multiply” in verse 22. It may be necessary to translate the phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
1:28	xie5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	וּ⁠רְב֛וּ	1	“so that you {and your descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many”
1:28	lpep			וּ⁠מִלְא֥וּ אֶת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	“and live all over the earth” or “and inhabit the whole earth” or “Fill the earth”. For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
1:28	g9jo			וְ⁠כִבְשֻׁ֑⁠הָ	1	“and take control/care of it.” or “and bring it under your control.”
1:28	c3f8			וּ⁠רְד֞וּ	1	“You must rule over” or “You are in charge of” or “I am giving you authority to rule/oversee/manage”. See how you translated “rule” in verse 26.
1:28	prup			בִּ⁠דְגַ֤ת הַ⁠יָּם֙ וּ⁠בְ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	“the fish in the ocean, the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” See how you translated these phrases in verse 26.
1:28	ytrg			וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל חַיָּ֖ה הָֽ⁠רֹמֶ֥שֶׂת עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“and every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land.” or “and all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land.” This phrase refers generally here to every kind of creature that lives on land.
1:29	sqcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	“Then God/he {also} said {to them},” or “Then God/he continued/added,” God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add “also” to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However, the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best.
1:29	a4r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	הִנֵּה֩	1	“Look,” or “Listen {to this},” or “I want you to know that”. This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention. Consider what is the best way to translate this term in your language.
1:29	uvuf			נָתַ֨תִּי לָ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	“I am {now} giving to you {as/for food}” or “I have provided {as food} for you” or “I am {now} providing {as food} for you”
1:29	oakn			אֶת כָּל עֵ֣שֶׂב זֹרֵ֣עַ זֶ֗רַע אֲשֶׁר֙	1	“every {kind/type of} seed-bearing plant that grows” or “every {kind/type of} plant with seeds that grows” or “all the {different kinds/types of} plants that yield/produce seeds and grow”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.
1:29	nq9g			עַל פְּנֵ֣י כָל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“anywhere on/throughout the earth,”
1:29	nn9g			וְ⁠אֶת־כָּל־הָ⁠עֵ֛ץ אֲשֶׁר	1	“as well as every {kind/type of} tree that {bears/produces}” or “and all the {different kinds/types of} trees that {bear/produce}”
1:29	zjwv			בּ֥⁠וֹ פְרִי עֵ֖ץ זֹרֵ֣עַ זָ֑רַע	1	“fruit with seeds inside it.” or “seed-bearing fruit.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.
1:29	ird8			לָ⁠כֶ֥ם יִֽהְיֶ֖ה לְ⁠אָכְלָֽה	1	“{All of} them are yours to eat from.” or “You may eat from {any/all of} those plants.”
1:30	h154			וּֽ⁠לְ⁠כָל חַיַּ֣ת הָ֠⁠אָרֶץ	1	“In the same way, to every {kind/type of} {wild/untamed} creature/animal {that lives} on the earth/land,” or “Similarly/Likewise, to all the {wild/untamed} creatures/animals {that live} on the earth/land,” or “In the same way, to all the wild animals,” See how you translated similar phrases in verses 24 and 25.
1:30	cxyb			וּ⁠לְ⁠כָל ע֨וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֜יִם	1	“and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky,” or “and all the birds {that fly} in the sky,”
1:30	n7vq			וּ⁠לְ⁠כֹ֣ל רוֹמֵ֣שׂ עַל הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁר בּ⁠וֹ֙ נֶ֣פֶשׁ חַיָּ֔ה	1	“and every {other} {kind/type of} {creature/animal} that moves/lives on the earth/land and has the breath of life,” or “and all the {other} creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land and breathe {air} to live,” See how you translated “that moves on the earth” in verse 28.
1:30	hifc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֶת כָּל יֶ֥רֶק עֵ֖שֶׂב לְ⁠אָכְלָ֑ה	1	“{I give} every {kind/type of} green plant for/as food.” or “{I have given/provided} all the green plants for/as food.” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse and say, “In the same way, {I give} every {type of} green plant for food to all the {wild} animals {that live} on the earth, and all the birds {that fly} in the sky, and all the {other} animals {that live} on the land and breathe {air}.” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “plant” in verses 11, 12, 29.
1:30	ivkg			וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	“And that is how it was.” or “And it/everything was {exactly} as he/God said {it should/would be}.” Consider again how you translated this sentence in verses 7, 9, 11, 15, 24 and 30. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context. For example, here in verse 30 this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command.
1:31	hhg6			וַ⁠יַּ֤רְא אֱלֹהִים֙	1	“Then God observed/considered” or “Then God looked at”. See how you translated “God saw …” in verse 4.
1:31	c85e			אֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה	1	“everything that he had made/created,” This phrase refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated “made” (or “make”) in verses 7, 16, 25, 26 and 31. Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning (“created”) in verses 1, 21 and 27.
1:31	w4pz			וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	“and indeed” or “and he saw/observed that”. This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good.
1:31	uixn			ט֖וֹב מְאֹ֑ד	1	“{it was} {all} very good/excellent.” Consider again how you translated “good/excellent” in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, and 31.
1:31	pjit			וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	“Then evening came, and {then/later} morning came,” Consider again how you translated these phrases in verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23, and 31, and see the note about that at verse 5.
1:31	vsiy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם הַ⁠שִּׁשִּֽׁי	1	“{and that was} {the end of} the sixth day.” or “and the sixth day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day six.”
2:1	alnx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יְכֻלּ֛וּ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֥יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	“So {it was that} the heavens and the earth were completed/finished {by God},” or “That is how {God} finished {creating/making} the heavens and the earth,” Verse 1 is a summary statement that looks back at what God did in chapter 1. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here, and see how you translated “heavens and earth” in Gen 1:1.
2:1	eaz5			וְ⁠כָל צְבָאָֽ⁠ם	1	“including all the many things that are in them.” or “along with everything in them.” This phrase refers to everything in the heavens and on the earth that God had created, as described in chapter 1.
2:2	lmmc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	“By the seventh day” or “By day seven”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God had completed his work by the seventh day and did not work on that day. Also consider again how you translated ordinal numbers in Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2.
2:2	zkij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְכַ֤ל אֱלֹהִים֙	1	“God/he had completed/finished” or “God/he was finished with”. Decide whether it is better in your language to refer to God with a title (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context.
2:2	qp74			מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה	1	“his/the work he had been doing,”
2:2	lqw7			וַ⁠יִּשְׁבֹּת֙ בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִ⁠כָּל	1	“so he rested/ceased on that day from all” or “so on the seventh day he no longer did”. God “rested” in the sense that he stopped his work and did not work on that day. It does not mean he was tired or had lost his strength. Rest is an important theme in the Bible, so you should try to be consistent in how you translate this term here and in other passages such as Exodus 23:12, 31:17 and Hebrews 4:4, 10. Part of this theme includes the Hebrew word for “Sabbath” which has the same root word as the verb for “rest” and is often translated “resting day.”
2:2	mtu9			מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָֽׂה	1	“the work that he had been doing.” or “that work.”
2:3	aq2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יְבָ֤רֶךְ אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶת י֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	“Then God/he established/designated the seventh day {as a day} to bless {people}” or “God/He honored the seventh day”. For some languages it is more natural to begin verse 3 without a conjunction. Other languages use a conjunction here like Hebrew does. Do what is natural in your language.
2:3	frsr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יְקַדֵּ֖שׁ אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	“and made it a holy/sacred day,” or “and set it apart as a day especially devoted/dedicated to him,” or “by setting it apart as a special day/time {for people/them} {to rest and worship him},”
2:3	zlsb			כִּ֣י ב֤⁠וֹ	1	“because on/during that day” or “{He did that} because on/during that day”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
2:3	kcwq			שָׁבַת֙ מִ⁠כָּל מְלַאכְתּ֔⁠וֹ	1	“he ceased from all his/the work” or “he did not do any more work” or “he no longer did the work”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2.
2:3	oxs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר בָּרָ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	“of creating that he had been doing.” or “that he had been doing, creating {everything}.”
2:4	m6ic			אֵ֣לֶּה	1	“These {are more details about}” or “This {is more about}” or “What follows {gives/tells more details about}”. This phrase refers forward to Gen 2:5-24 and begins a new section. Chapter one of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. Chapter two gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
2:4	ptfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תוֹלְד֧וֹת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֛יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בְּ⁠הִבָּֽרְאָ֑⁠ם	1	“the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created {by God},” or “what happened when {God} created the heavens and the earth.” or “the history of what {God} did when he created the heavens and the earth:” The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth. Decide the best way to do that in your language.
2:4	i0br			בְּ⁠י֗וֹם	1	“during the days/time {when}” or “During the days/time {when}”. Consider whether or not it is clearer or more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 5.
2:4	igt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“Yahweh {who is} God” or “God {whose name is} Yahweh”. This phrase is a combination of God’s personal name “Yahweh” with his title “God.” Both are used together when he is especially in focus. This pattern of using a personal name and a title together is also used for people in the Old Testament when they are being emphasized, for example, “Ahab king of Israel” and “Ruth the Moabitess.” Many translations have “LORD God” in place of “Yahweh God” throughout the Old Testament. This follows the Jewish custom of substituting the Hebrew title “Adonai” (which means “my Lord”) for “Yahweh” (which means “he is”) when they read the Scriptures aloud. More recently, translation teams are putting “Yahweh” back in the Bible text (especially in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament), and they include a footnote to explain the term. (Some translation teams consider using “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh.” However that is not a name from the Bible, but is formed by taking the consonants from “Yahweh” and combining them with the vowels from “Adonai.”)
2:4	h1ao		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-chiasm	עֲשׂ֛וֹת & אֶ֥רֶץ וְ⁠שָׁמָֽיִם	1	“made/created the earth and the heavens”. This clause forms a chiasm with “the heavens and the earth … created” in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated “the heavens” and “the earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1.
2:5	yi7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠כֹ֣ל ׀ שִׂ֣יחַ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה טֶ֚רֶם יִֽהְיֶ֣ה בָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“And/Now {for a while,} there were not yet any shrubs/bushes in the fields} on the earth,” or “{For a while,} no wild shrubs/bushes had started growing on the earth yet,” Consider whether or not it is better in your translation to begin a new sentence here. Verses 5-6 give background information about what things were like before God created mankind (verse 7). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is best in your language.
2:5	gyov			וְ⁠כָל עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה טֶ֣רֶם יִצְמָ֑ח	1	“nor had any {other} plants started growing yet,” or “and there were not any {other} plants that had sprouted yet,” See how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29-30.
2:5	iiqn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כִּי֩ & יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙	1	“because Yahweh/he” or “{That was} because God”. The Hebrew text repeats “Yahweh God” frequently in chapter 2 (starting in verse 4) to emphasize God. For some languages, it is not natural to repeat “Yahweh God” so often in the same paragraph, and it could even give the wrong meaning that there was more than one Yahweh God. For languages like that, it may be best to use “Yahweh God” only once at the beginning of a section or paragraph, then use “Yahweh”, “God”, or “he” in the rest of the section, depending on the context. Consider what is the most accurate and natural way to refer to Yahweh God at each point in your translation.
2:5	dsr2			לֹ֨א הִמְטִ֜יר & עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“had not {yet} caused it to rain on the earth,” or “had not {yet} sent/caused rain to water the earth,” See how you translated “earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1.
2:5	jour			וְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אַ֔יִן	1	“and there were no human beings {yet}” or “and mankind/humans did not exist {yet}”
2:5	mdd4			לַֽ⁠עֲבֹ֖ד אֶת הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	“to cultivate/farm the land/soil.” Working the ground includes tasks such as clearing the ground, preparing the soil, planting seeds, and watering the plants. See how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
2:6	vsou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠אֵ֖ד	1	“But {during/at that time} mist/water/groundwater” or “{During/At that time} mist/springs”. The Hebrew word for “mist” refers to water in some form, such as water vapor, springs, or streams of water. Also, some translations begin verse 6 without “But”. Do what is best in your language.
2:6	ytxq			יַֽעֲלֶ֣ה	1	“seeped up” or “kept coming/seeping up” or “would come/seep up”. This verb describes a repeated or continuous action.
2:6	t93l			מִן הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“from the ground” or “from underground”
2:6	srec			וְ⁠הִשְׁקָ֖ה	1	“and irrigated” or “and spread over” or “supplied water to”
2:6	qd1o			אֶֽת כָּל פְּנֵֽי הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	“the entire/whole surface of the land/earth.” or “the ground everywhere.”
2:7	fjjv			וַ⁠יִּיצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	“Then Yahweh {who is} God shaped/crafted”. The word “formed” describes what an expert craftsmen would do, and implies artistic skills and design. See how you translated “Yahweh God” in Gen 2:4-5.
2:7	dbat			אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	“a man” or “the {first} man”. The definite article “the” is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human. For many languages it is more natural to use an indefinite article (“a”) to introduce him here, or to not use an article at all. Do what is best in your language.
2:7	pmfi			עָפָר֙	1	“{out of} dirt/mud/clay”. The word used here in the Hebrew text is usually translated “dust” (as in Gen 13:16, 28:14), but it can also be translated “dirt” (as in Gen 26:15) or “mortar/mud/clay” (as in Leviticus 14:42). The dirt would have been damp enough to be formed or shaped.
2:7	g3a2			מִן הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	“from the earth,” For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in the first half of this verse and say, “Then Yahweh {who is} God {took} {some} dirt/clay from the ground/earth {and} formed/shaped a man {out of it},” Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25 and 2:5-6. You may need to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
2:7	xkca			וַ⁠יִּפַּ֥ח	1	“and he/Yahweh blew/exhaled” or “Then he/Yahweh blew/exhaled”. For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
2:7	qzjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠אַפָּ֖י⁠ו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים	1	“into the man’s nostrils/nose the/his breath that would make him live,” or “his breath into the man’s nostrils/nose to make him live,” This refers to God’s breath. As you translate the pronouns “he” and “his” in this verse, make sure it is clear in your language who is being referred to.
2:7	vf52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לְ⁠נֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּֽה	1	“so that he became a living person.” or “and then the man became alive” or “and he came to life.” or “so that he started to live.” Consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the man throughout verse 7.
2:8	z5wl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּטַּ֞ע יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “Now Yahweh God had {previously/already} planted” or “{Before that,} Yahweh God had planted”. This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three (Gen 1:11-12), three days before he created man (Gen 1:26-27; 2:7). Following this view, verses 8-14 give background information for what happens in verses 15-24. (2) “Then Yahweh God planted”. According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six after he created man.
2:8	npa8			גַּן	1	“a {large} garden” or “a {large} farm/park”. The man lived in this garden, and there were animals and many trees and other plants in it too, so it was fairly large. Make sure your translation of this term does not refer to something that is too small.
2:8	msch			בְ⁠עֵ֖דֶן מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	“in {the land/region of/called} Eden, {which was} in/to the east,” or “in the eastern part of {the land/region of/called} Eden,” In this context, the phrase “in the east” could refer to: (1) the eastern part of the region of Eden; or (2) a region east of where Moses lived when he wrote this. It is best, if possible, to keep your translation of this phrase general here (like the Hebrew text).
2:8	zpxl			וַ⁠יָּ֣שֶׂם שָׁ֔ם אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	“and that is where he put the man” or “and in that garden he put the man” or “That is where he put the man”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
2:8	uvlv			אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָצָֽר	1	“whom he had shaped/crafted.” or “whom he had created/made.” See how you translated “formed” in verse 7.
2:9	wihv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּצְמַ֞ח יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ מִן־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה כָּל־עֵ֛ץ נֶחְמָ֥ד	1	“{There} Yahweh/he had made/caused to grow from the ground every {kind/type of} tree that is pleasant/beautiful/delightful” or “Yahweh/He had made/caused all {kinds/types of} trees to grow from the ground that are pleasant/beautiful”. See how you translated “Yahweh God” in verse 5, and how you translated “every tree” in Gen 1:29.
2:9	zqug			לְ⁠מַרְאֶ֖ה	1	“to the eyes” or “to look at” or “in appearance”
2:9	kslw			וְ⁠ט֣וֹב	1	“and {that produce/have/grow fruit that is} good” or “and {whose fruit is} good”
2:9	rc1t			לְ⁠מַאֲכָ֑ל	1	“for eating,” or “to eat,”
2:9	urhf			וְ⁠עֵ֤ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּים֙ בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠גָּ֔ן	1	“including the tree whose fruit gives people {eternal} life, {which was} in the middle of the garden,” or “In the middle of the garden was the tree whose fruit makes people live {forever},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
2:9	vdwn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וְ⁠עֵ֕ץ הַ⁠דַּ֖עַת ט֥וֹב וָ⁠רָֽע	1	“as well as the tree whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong.” The word “good” refers here to all that is morally right and pleasing to God, and “evil” refers to what is morally wrong and against his will. Keep that in mind as you translate these terms.
2:10	af8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠נָהָרּ֙ יֹצֵ֣א	1	“Now a river was flowing” or “A river was flowing” or “There was a river flowing”. Verse 10 gives more background information that began in verse 8. Many translations omit the conjunction “And” or “Now” here. Do what is best in your language.
2:10	pp02			מֵ⁠עֵ֔דֶן	1	“from/through {the land/region of} Eden”. The garden was inside the land of Eden, so as the river flowed through Eden, it watered the garden.
2:10	rcms			לְ⁠הַשְׁק֖וֹת	1	“to irrigate” or “to provide water for” or “that watered/irrigated” or “that provided water for”. See how you translated “watered” in verse 6.
2:10	wxka			אֶת הַ⁠גָּ֑ן	1	“the farm/park,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 8.
2:10	gpkv			וּ⁠מִ⁠שָּׁם֙	1	“and from the garden” or “From there/Eden”. For some languages it is better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
2:10	h8ke			יִפָּרֵ֔ד וְ⁠הָיָ֖ה לְ⁠אַרְבָּעָ֥ה רָאשִֽׁים	1	Verse 10 is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean: (1) “the/that river divided into four {smaller} waters/rivers.” This interpretation means that the river in Eden was the source river that watered the garden and then divided downstream into the four smaller rivers. (2) “there were four {smaller} source rivers that joined together and formed the larger river.” This interpretation means that the four rivers were source headwaters that flowed downstream and joined to form the larger river in Eden. If possible, leave your translation ambiguous here (like the Hebrew text does), so that either interpretation is possible.
2:11	ty1t			שֵׁ֥ם הָֽ⁠אֶחָ֖ד	1	“The name of the first {river} {is/was}” or “The first {river} is/was named/called” or “The first {river} is/was”. Most translations use past tense in verse 10, but then use present tense throughout verses 11-14. It may be best to use past tense throughout verses 10-14, especially since the rivers and places that are named in these verses no longer existed when Genesis was written, because the Flood completely changed the entire surface of the earth; after the Flood, the names of some of those rivers and places were given to new rivers and places.
2:11	fhgs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	פִּישׁ֑וֹן	1	“the Pishon {River}.” Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use the article (“the”) with the name of a river.
2:11	k73q			ה֣וּא הַ⁠סֹּבֵ֗ב	1	“It meanders/meandered through” or “which flows/flowed around through”. The word “winds” or “meanders” means that the river changed direction from time to time. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the previous sentence.
2:11	kdfc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֵ֚ת כָּל אֶ֣רֶץ הַֽ⁠חֲוִילָ֔ה	1	“the entire/whole region of/called Havilah,” Be consistent in how you translate “land of” throughout this section.
2:11	lg1b			אֲשֶׁר שָׁ֖ם הַ⁠זָּהָֽב	1	“{a place} where {there is/was} {much} gold.” or “which has/had {a lot of} gold.”
2:12	v48n			וּֽ⁠זֲהַ֛ב הָ⁠אָ֥רֶץ הַ⁠הִ֖וא	1	“In fact, the gold from that land/region” or “Indeed, the gold {that is found} in that land/region”. This sentence emphasizes the previous statement about the gold and gives more information about it.
2:12	ks18			ט֑וֹב	1	“{is/was} {very} pure.” or “{is/was} {very} high quality.”
2:12	qhx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠בְּדֹ֖לַח	1	“{A kind/type of fragrant/sweet-smelling resin called} bdellium” or “A {kind/type of} fragrant/sweet-smelling resin/perfume”. The meaning of this Hebrew word is not certain. In many translations it is transliterated, that is, spelled the way the Hebrew word is pronounced. It may refer to: (1) a fragrant/sweet-smelling tree resin that was used to make perfume; or (2) a type of stone or crystal, or possibly pearl.
2:12	ul5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠אֶ֥בֶן הַ⁠שֹּֽׁהַם	1	“and {valuable} onyx gemstones” or “and {valuable} stones/gemstones called onyx” or “and {valuable} gemstones”. It is not certain what kind of stone this was, but most Bible scholars think it was onyx, which is a kind of quartz that is often black, but also occurs in many other colors, and can have stripes or bands of white (or other colors) running through it.
2:12	cp1z			שָׁ֥ם	1	“{are/were} {also} {found} there.” or “{are/were} {also} in that land/region.” Make sure the verb tense you choose here fits with the way you translated verse 11.
2:13	fnx5			וְ⁠שֵֽׁם הַ⁠נָּהָ֥ר הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֖י	1	“The name of the second river {is/was}” or “The second river is/was named/called” or “The second river is/was”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.
2:13	tdei			גִּיח֑וֹן	1	“the Gihon {River}.”
2:13	spk8			ה֣וּא הַ⁠סּוֹבֵ֔ב	1	“It meanders/meandered through” or “which flows/flowed around through”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to begin a new sentence or to continue the previous sentence. See how you translated this phrase in verse 11.
2:13	fgb5			אֵ֖ת כָּל אֶ֥רֶץ כּֽוּשׁ	1	“the entire/whole region of/called Cush.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.
2:14	a2na			וְ⁠שֵׁ֨ם הַ⁠נָּהָ֤ר הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁי֙	1	“The name of the third river {is/was}” or “The third river is/was named/called” or “The third river is/was”
2:14	eo4t			חִדֶּ֔קֶל	1	“the Tigris {River}.”
2:14	go4b			ה֥וּא הַֽ⁠הֹלֵ֖ךְ קִדְמַ֣ת	1	“It flows/flowed {in an area} east of” or “which flows/flowed {in an area} east of” or “which was located east of”. The word “east” refers to where the river was located, not the direction it was flowing.
2:14	h2lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אַשּׁ֑וּר	1	“{the land/region of/called} Asshur/Assyria.” This Hebrew name is pronounced “ash-shur” and is spelled “Asshur,” “Ashur,” or “Assyria” in English, depending on the context. This was a region of land, because at that time there were no cities. Most translations have “Assyria” here. Consider again how you translated “the land of” in verses 11 and 13.
2:14	wu7c			וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּהָ֥ר הָֽ⁠רְבִיעִ֖י	1	“{The name of} the fourth river {is/was}” or “The fourth river {is/was named/called}” or “and the fourth river {is/was}”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11, 13-14. Also consider again whether it is best in your language to use present tense or past tense in verses 10-14.
2:14	u87b			פְרָֽת	1	“the Euphrates {River}.” Consider again how you translated the names of rivers in verses 11, 13-14.
2:15	qijo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֛ח יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם וַ⁠יַּנִּחֵ֣⁠הוּ	1	“Now Yahweh God had {already} put the man” or “After Yahweh God put the man”. In verse 8 it says that God had already put the man in the garden, so the way you translate verse 15 should not sound like he did it again. This information is repeated here to continue the story from verse 8.
2:15	rosi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְ⁠גַן עֵ֔דֶן	1	“in the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “in Eden Garden”. Notice that “Garden” is capitalized when it is part of a name.
2:15	iaic			לְ⁠עָבְדָ֖⁠הּ	1	“to cultivate/farm it” or “so that he would cultivate/farm it”. See how you translated “work” in verse 5.
2:15	hyvl			וּ⁠לְ⁠שָׁמְרָֽ⁠הּ	1	“and maintain it.” or “and take care of it.”
2:16	qqer		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְצַו֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים עַל־הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“Then Yahweh/he commanded the man,” or “he commanded him,” The way you begin verse 16 depends on how you began verse 15. Consider what is the best way to refer to “Yahweh God” and “the man” here.
2:16	vzb0			מִ⁠כֹּ֥ל עֵֽץ הַ⁠גָּ֖ן אָכֹ֥ל תֹּאכֵֽל	1	“You may eat as much {fruit} as you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden,” or “You are permitted to eat whatever fruit that you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden,”
2:17	vfsb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֵ֗ץ & לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל	1	“except you must/may not eat {any fruit} from the tree” or “except for one: you must/may not eat {the fruit that grows} on the tree” or “except I forbid you to eat {any fruit} from the tree”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is not contradicting himself here, but rather he is giving an exception to what he said in verse 16. To make that clear, you could say (starting with the beginning of God’s words in verse 16), “Out of all the trees in the garden, there is only one tree that you must/may not eat from: the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat fruit from that tree, on that {same} day you will certainly/definitely die.”
2:17	eja9			הַ⁠דַּ֨עַת֙ ט֣וֹב וָ⁠רָ֔ע	1	“whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 9.
2:17	w7aq			כִּ֗י בְּ⁠י֛וֹם אֲכָלְ⁠ךָ֥ מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ	1	“because on the {same} day you eat {fruit} from that tree” or “If you eat {any fruit} from that tree, on that {same} day” or “because as soon as you eat {fruit} from that tree”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
2:17	z028			מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת	1	“you will certainly/definitely die.”
2:18	mxit			וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים לֹא ט֛וֹב	1	“Then/Next Yahweh {who is} God declared, {It is} not good”

2:18	ap1y			לּ֥⁠וֹ עֵ֖זֶר כְּ⁠נֶגְדּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“a helper/companion who is {just/exactly} right for him.” or “someone who is suitable/right for him and will help him.” or “a suitable companion to help him.”
2:19	ukcz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים מִן הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָ֗ה	1	“Now {before that,} Yahweh God had formed/shaped from {the dust/dirt on} the ground” or “Now {previously,} Yahweh/he had used {dust/dirt} from the ground to form/shape”. The first sentence of verse 19 is a flashback of what happened before the events in verses 15-18 (which were first recorded in Gen 1:20-21, 24-25). Translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is background information that has already happened. Also see how you translated “formed” in verses 7-8 and “dust from the ground” in verse 7.
2:19	kk7t			כָּל חַיַּ֤ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶה֙	1	“every {kind/type of} creature/animal that lives in the fields/wild” or “all {the different kinds/types of} animals that live in the fields” or “all {the different kinds/types of} wild animals”. Consider how you translated a similar phrase (“every living creature of the earth”) in Gen 1:24, 30.
2:19	y8bl			וְ⁠אֵת֙ כָּל ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	“and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky.” or “and all {the different kinds/types of} birds {that fly} in the sky.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.
2:19	qvln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֵא֙	1	“So/Then he brought/took them {all}”. This sentence continues the storyline. Consider how your language continues a story after giving background information. Also consider whether “brought” or “took” fits best here in your language.
2:19	p3x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶל הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	“to Adam”. Every translation team needs to decide when to use Adam’s name for the first time in the book of Genesis. The Hebrew word “adam” means “man” and is also Adam’s name; the choice that is not followed here in your translation could be put in a footnote. Some translations first use Adam’s name here in verse 19, when he is naming the animals. Many other translations start using his name at the end of verse 20. Still other translations wait until 3:20 when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in 3:9, 17, or 21.
2:19	apte			לִ⁠רְא֖וֹת	1	“to watch/hear” or “to find out”
2:19	rgyf			מַה יִּקְרָא ל֑⁠וֹ	1	“what he would name each one,” or “what names he would give/assign to them,” These names were labels for what kind of animals they were, such as “dog” or “horse”, not personal names like “David” or “Mary”.
2:19	by9q			וְ⁠כֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִקְרָא ל֧⁠וֹ הָֽ⁠אָדָ֛ם	1	“and whatever Adam called/named” or “Whatever name the man gave/assigned to”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

2:19	waxk			ה֥וּא שְׁמֽ⁠וֹ	1	“that {became} its name.” or “that {became} the name of/for that kind/type of animal.”
2:20	rs26			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֜ם שֵׁמ֗וֹת לְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠בְּהֵמָה֙	1	“The man gave/assigned names to all the {different kinds/types of} livestock” or “Adam named all the {different kinds/types of} domestic/tame animals”. For a note about when to first use Adam’s name, see verse 19. Also, see how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26.
2:20	e137			וּ⁠לְ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	“and to {all} the {different kinds/types of} birds {that fly} in the sky”

Also see how you translated “a suitable helper” in verse 18.
2:21	stgv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּפֵּל֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֧ים תַּרְדֵּמָ֛ה עַל הָ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	“So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to fall/go into a deep/sound sleep.” or “So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to sleep {very} deeply/soundly.” Many languages have a similar idiom for “caused a deep sleep to fall on” that works well here. Consider what is best in your language.
2:21	ti50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּישָׁ֑ן	1	“Then {while} the man was sleeping/asleep,” Consider whether it is best in your language to use a pronoun or a noun here to refer to the man.
2:21	xamp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֗ח	1	“he/God took {out}”. Consider whether to use a pronoun or noun here to refer to God. Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to at each point in this verse.
2:21	l63g			אַחַת֙ מִ⁠צַּלְעֹתָ֔י⁠ו	1	This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean: (1) “one of the man’s ribs {from his body/side}” or “a rib {from the man’s body/side}” or (2) “part of the man’s side {from his body}”
2:21	k98y			וַ⁠יִּסְגֹּ֥ר בָּשָׂ֖ר תַּחְתֶּֽ⁠נָּה	1	“and filled in the place/hole where it had been with flesh {and healed it}.” or “and replaced it with flesh {and healed him}.” In this context, the term “flesh” probably includes muscles and skin.
2:22	wmbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּבֶן֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֧ים	1	“Next Yahweh God” or “Next he” or “After that, Yahweh/he”. For many languages it is more natural here to use a pronoun to refer to Yahweh God. Do what is best in your language. After you finish translating a chapter or section, it is a good practice to read that section aloud and listen for what is the best way to refer to God and others at each place in the text.
2:22	m5wn			וַ⁠יִּבֶן֩ & אֶֽת הַ⁠צֵּלָ֛ע אֲשֶׁר לָקַ֥ח מִן הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לְ⁠אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	“made/constructed a woman from the rib which he had taken out of the man{’s body},” or “used the rib which he taken from the man to make/construct a woman from it,” See how you translated “rib” in verse 21 and see the note about that there.
2:22	w6xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יְבִאֶ֖⁠הָ אֶל הָֽ⁠אָדָֽם	1	“and he took her to the man.” or “Then he brought/took her to the man.” See how you translated “brought” in verse 19.
2:23	b3g6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֮ הָֽ⁠אָדָם֒	1	“Then the man said/exclaimed,” or “{When the man saw her,} he said/exclaimed,” or “{When the man woke up and saw the woman,} he said/exclaimed,” Remember to only make implied information explicit in your translation if it helps people understand the text better or if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or bad grammar in your language.
2:23	cus9			זֹ֣את הַ⁠פַּ֗עַם	1	“Now there is a person who” or “At last here is a person {like me} who” or “Finally/Ahh! Here is someone {like me} who”
2:23	dbqq			עֶ֚צֶם מֵֽ⁠עֲצָמַ֔⁠י וּ⁠בָשָׂ֖ר מִ⁠בְּשָׂרִ֑⁠י	1	“{has} bones and flesh from me!” or “was made out of my own bones and flesh!”
2:23	pbw7			לְ⁠זֹאת֙ יִקָּרֵ֣א אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	“I will call her ‘woman,’ ” There is a play-on-words here because the Hebrew word for woman (“ishsha”) is similar to the Hebrew word for man (“ish”). You could put that information in a footnote.
2:23	dsb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כִּ֥י מֵ⁠אִ֖ישׁ לֻֽקֳחָה זֹּֽאת	1	“because she was taken {by God} from {the body of} a man.” or “because {it was} from {the body of} a man {that} {God} took her.” Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language.
2:24	oti6			עַל כֵּן֙	1	“Because of that,” or “That is why” or “Since the woman was created from the man’s body,”
2:24	u45s			יַֽעֲזָב אִ֔ישׁ	1	“a/every man {who marries} will/must leave” or “{when a man gets married,} he must move away from”

Consider what is the best way to translate this in your language.
2:24	fqua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וְ⁠הָי֖וּ	1	“so that they become”. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for “they” that fits well here.
2:24	lhdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠בָשָׂ֥ר אֶחָֽד	1	“completely one/united.” or “united in body {and spirit}.” or “united like one person.” The phrase “one flesh” is an idiom that emphasizes the close physical and spiritual unity between a husband and wife. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Consider how to best communicate this in your language.
2:25	rovf			וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ שְׁנֵי⁠הֶם֙ עֲרוּמִּ֔ים הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“Now {at/during that time} both the man and his wife were naked,” or “{At/During that time} the man and his wife did not wear any clothes,”
2:25	m37h			וְ⁠לֹ֖א יִתְבֹּשָֽׁשׁוּ	1	“but {yet} they were not ashamed/embarrassed {about it}.” or “but {yet} they did not feel ashamed/embarrassed {about being naked}.” Some languages have an idiom for this clause that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.
3:1	k1xo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּחָשׁ֙	1	“Now the snake”. The conjunction “Now” introduces background information about the serpent. See how you translated this conjunction in Gen 2:5, 8, 19.
3:1	c6pe			הָיָ֣ה עָר֔וּם מִ⁠כֹּל֙ חַיַּ֣ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	“was more {deceptive and} clever/cunning than any of the {other} creatures/animals that live in the fields/wild” or “was the craftiest of all the animals”. Make sure that your translation of “crafty” means that the snake had evil intent and was clever in a way that was not good. See how you translated “living thing of the field” in Gen 2:19-20.
3:1	xal9			אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	“that Yahweh {who is} God had made/created.” or “that God {whose name is} Yahweh had made/created.” Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the animals that God had made, not the fields. Also see how you translated “Yahweh God” in chapter 2, beginning in verse 4.
3:1	jqok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ אֶל־הָ֣⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	“{One day} he asked the woman,” or “{One day} the serpent/snake {came/went to} the woman {and} asked {her},” If you use a pronoun (“he”) here in your translation, make sure it refers to the serpent, not God. Also, since the snake asked a question, some languages have to be more specific and say “asked” in the quote margin. Do what is best in your language.
3:1	za8o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אַ֚ף כִּֽי אָמַ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֔ים לֹ֣א תֹֽאכְל֔וּ	1	“Did God really/actually command you to not eat” or “Is it true that God commanded you not to eat”. Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote.
3:1	iqz3			מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל עֵ֥ץ הַ⁠גָּֽן	1	“{fruit} from any of the trees {that is/are} in the garden?” or “{any fruit} from the trees in the garden?” See how you translated “garden” in Genesis 2, beginning in verse 8.
3:2	gevr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֥אמֶר הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֖ה אֶל הַ⁠נָּחָ֑שׁ	1	“The woman answered the serpent/snake,” or “The woman responded to him,” or “The woman replied,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language.
3:2	kllk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נֹאכֵֽל	1	“{No,} we have permission {from God/him} to eat” or “{No,} God/he has given us permission to eat”. The woman is not including the snake when she says “we” here.
3:2	gy6f			מִ⁠פְּרִ֥י	1	“the fruit of/from” or “fruit from”. See how you translated “fruit” in Gen 1:11-12, 29.
3:2	fmke			עֵֽץ הַ⁠גָּ֖ן	1	“{any/all of} the tree{s} {that are} in the garden,” or “{any} tree in the garden,”
3:3	t2wx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	וּ⁠מִ⁠פְּרִ֣י הָ⁠עֵץ֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠תוֹךְ הַ⁠גָּן֒	1	“except fruit from the tree that is in the middle/center of the garden.” or “except there is one tree that we must/may not eat fruit from, which is in the middle/center of the garden.” For some languages it is necessary to put the exception clause first and say, “{No,} it is only the tree in the middle of the garden that {God said} we must/may not eat any fruit from, but the fruit of/from {all the rest of} the trees in the garden we may eat.” Notice that if you follow this example, you must combine verses 2 and 3 and put the verse numbers “2-3” in front of the combination.
3:3	nz0q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אָמַ֣ר אֱלֹהִ֗ים לֹ֤א תֹֽאכְלוּ֙ מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	“God/he told/commanded {us}, ‘Do not eat fruit from that tree,” or “God/He told/commanded {us} to not eat {any of} that fruit,” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote.
3:3	anrc			וְ⁠לֹ֥א תִגְּע֖וּ בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“and do not even touch it,” or “or even touch it,”
3:3	ztft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	פֶּן תְּמֻתֽוּ⁠ן	1	“because if you do {eat it or touch it}, you will die!” or “because if we do {eat it or touch it}, we will die!” Make sure the way you translate this clause fits with whether you translated the first part of the sentence as a direct (“you”) or indirect (“we”) quote.
3:4	j40v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר הַ⁠נָּחָ֖שׁ אֶל־הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	“But the snake said/replied to her,” or “But the snake replied,” See how you translated “serpent” in verses 1-2.
3:4	k0j2			לֹֽא מ֖וֹת תְּמֻתֽוּ⁠ן	1	“{That is not true.} You will not die.” or “It’s not true that you will die.”
3:5	ngb0			כִּ֚י יֹדֵ֣עַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“Actually, God/he knows” or “The reason God said that is because he knows”. The connecting word “For” introduces an explanation here. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.
3:5	tr2j			כִּ֗י בְּ⁠יוֹם֙	1	“that as soon as” or “that when/if”
3:5	p329		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-dual	אֲכָלְ⁠כֶ֣ם מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	“you eat {fruit} from that tree,” or “you eat some/any of that fruit,” The pronouns “you” and “your” are plural in this verse and refer to the man and the woman. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for this. Consider again how you translated “you” and “your” in verses 1-5.
3:5	uld2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“your mind/understanding will be opened/expanded,” or “you will gain/have new understanding,” or “you will understand/know new things,” Consider whether your language has an idiom like “your eyes will be opened” that would fit well here.
3:5	npzf			וִ⁠הְיִיתֶם֙ כֵּֽ⁠אלֹהִ֔ים יֹדְעֵ֖י ט֥וֹב וָ⁠רָֽע	1	“and {as a result} you will be like God/him because you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong.” or “so that you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong just like God does.” The Hebrew word “Elohim” is ambiguous in this context. It could mean: (1) “God”, which is what it means everywhere else in the first 30 chapters of Genesis; or (2) “gods” or “divine beings” or (3) “angels”. See how you translated “good and evil” in Gen 2:9, 17.
3:6	d6rz			וַ⁠תֵּ֣רֶא הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֡ה כִּ֣י	1	“The woman saw/observed that”
3:6	gpz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָ⁠עֵ֨ץ	1	“the tree {produced fruit that}” or “{the fruit of} that tree” or “the tree{’s fruit}”. The word “tree” refers here to the fruit that is produced by that tree. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
3:6	b6yp			טוֹב֩ & לְ⁠מַאֲכָ֜ל	1	“{was/looked} good/delicious to eat”
3:6	aigt			וְ⁠כִ֧י תַֽאֲוָה ה֣וּא לָ⁠עֵינַ֗יִם	1	“and that the tree {itself} was/looked {very} beautiful,”
3:6	tkg3			וְ⁠נֶחְמָ֤ד הָ⁠עֵץ֙ לְ⁠הַשְׂכִּ֔יל	1	“and {she thought/believed} that {the fruit from} the tree would make her wise/wiser.” or “She {also} desired/wanted {to eat} the fruit so that it would make her wise/wiser.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
3:6	jrei			וַ⁠תִּקַּ֥ח מִ⁠פִּרְי֖⁠וֹ וַ⁠תֹּאכַ֑ל	1	“So/Then she took/picked some of the fruit {from/off the tree} and ate {it}.”

3:6	vgh6			וַ⁠יֹּאכַֽל	1	“and he ate {it/some} {too}.” or “and he {also} ate {it/some}.”
3:7	on9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּפָּקַ֨חְנָה֙ עֵינֵ֣י שְׁנֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	“Immediately/Suddenly it was as if their eyes/minds were opened/enlightened,” or “Immediately/Suddenly they both gained/had new understanding,” or “Immediately/Suddenly they both understood new things,” An immediate result of their sin was that they realized they were naked, which they had not been aware of before. See how you translated the idiom “eyes … opened” in verse 5.
3:7	d586			וַ⁠יֵּ֣דְע֔וּ	1	“so that they realized” or “so that they became aware”
3:7	qm2z			כִּ֥י עֵֽירֻמִּ֖ם הֵ֑ם	1	“that their bodies {were} naked/uncovered/bare {and they felt ashamed/embarrassed}.”
3:7	pb3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וַֽ⁠יִּתְפְּרוּ֙	1	“So they fastened/joined {together}”. The word for “sewed” implies here that some type of needle and thread were used. For example, they may have used a thin, sharpened stick for the needle, and plant fibers for the thread. If necessary, you could use a more general term such as “fastened/joined together” or “connected”. Also, some languages have dual pronouns that can be used in verses 7-8 for “they” and “themselves”. Do what is best in your language.
3:7	e5t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עֲלֵ֣ה תְאֵנָ֔ה	1	“{some} fig {tree} leaves” or “{some} {large} leaves from a fig tree”. Historical facts should not be changed in a translation, including the historical fact that Adam and Eve used fig tree leaves to make aprons. If fig trees are not known in your language area, you could say “{large} leaves from a tree called a fig {tree}”.
3:7	h1a6			וַ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֥וּ לָ⁠הֶ֖ם חֲגֹרֹֽת	1	“and used/wore them like/as aprons/skirts/loincloths {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and wore them around their waists {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and used them to make clothes for themselves.” These aprons/skirts probably covered them from the waist down to somewhere around the knees.
3:8	ibyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֞וּ	1	“Then/Later the man and his wife heard”. For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the noun phrase “the man and his wife” here and then use a pronoun (“they”) later in this sentence. Do what is best in your language.
3:8	kd3q			אֶת ק֨וֹל יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים מִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ	1	“the sound of Yahweh God{’s footsteps} as he walked” or “Yahweh God’s voice as he walked”. This phrase can refer to the sound of God’s footsteps or to the sound of his voice. Either meaning fits the context well and is followed by many translations.
3:8	g02y			בַּ⁠גָּ֖ן	1	“{around} in the garden” or “through the garden”
3:8	dipk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠ר֣וּחַ הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	“{late in the afternoon} in/during the breezy/cool {time} of the day,” or “{late that afternoon/day} when there was a cool breeze blowing,” This idiom refers to the late afternoon or early evening when there is a breeze blowing and it is cooler. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase at the beginning of the sentence. Do what is best in your language.
3:8	x1fb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְחַבֵּ֨א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֜ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	“but/so they hid {themselves}” or “but/so they {tried to} hide {themselves}”. If you use “the man and his wife” earlier in this verse in your translation, consider whether or not a pronoun should be used here.
3:8	q6cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִ⁠פְּנֵי֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“from Yahweh God” or “from his presence/sight” or “from him”. Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh at this point in the paragraph in your language.
3:8	k6j3			בְּ⁠ת֖וֹךְ עֵ֥ץ הַ⁠גָּֽן	1	“in the midst of the tree{s} in the garden.” or “behind some tree{s} there.” Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in verse 8, for some languages it may be more natural to be general here and say “there”. Do what is best in your language.
3:9	e4nw			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֛א יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“Then/But Yahweh God called {out}”. See how you translated this name for God in verses 1 and 8.
3:9	ek33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אֶל הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר ל֖⁠וֹ	1	“to the man and asked him,” or “to Adam,” See the note at Gen 2:19 about when to start using Adam’s name. Also consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language.
3:9	a04v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַיֶּֽ⁠כָּה	1	“{Adam,} where are you?” Notice that the word “you” is singular here because God is only addressing the man.
3:10	e1lo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	“He/Adam answered {him},” or “The man replied,”
3:10	mb7t			אֶת קֹלְ⁠ךָ֥ שָׁמַ֖עְתִּי	1	“I heard the sound of you {walking}” or “I heard your voice” or “I heard the sound of your footsteps/voice {as you walked}”. See how you translated “sound” in verse 8.
3:10	tr9j			בַּ⁠גָּ֑ן	1	“through the garden,”
3:10	aoxc			וָ⁠אִירָ֛א כִּֽי עֵירֹ֥ם אָנֹ֖כִי וָ⁠אֵחָבֵֽא	1	“but I was naked, so I was/felt afraid and I hid {from you}.” or “but I was naked and afraid {that you would see me}, so I hid.”
3:11	hsb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	“So Yahweh God asked {him},” Make sure your translation of “he” refers to Yahweh here, not the man.
3:11	uf06		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מִ֚י הִגִּ֣יד לְ⁠ךָ֔ כִּ֥י עֵירֹ֖ם אָ֑תָּה	1	“What made you realize/know that you were naked?” or “How did you find out that you were naked?” The pronoun “you” is still singular here.
3:11	hetm			הֲ⁠מִן הָ⁠עֵ֗ץ & אָכָֽלְתָּ	1	“Did you {disobey me and} eat {fruit} from the tree”
3:11	gi9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֧ר צִוִּיתִ֛י⁠ךָ לְ⁠בִלְתִּ֥י אֲכָל מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ	1	“that I commanded you, ‘Do not eat from it’?” For some languages it is more natural to use a direct quote here for Yahweh’s words. Do what is best in your language.
3:12	hp6r			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	“But the man said/replied {to him},” or “The man answered {him},”
3:12	et6h			הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נָתַ֣תָּה עִמָּדִ֔⁠י הִ֛וא	1	“The woman whom you put here {to be/live} with me, she {is the one who}” or “It was the woman you gave to me who”. The pronoun “she” is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of “The woman” at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame of the woman. Consider what is the best way to communicate that emphasis in your language.
3:12	au82			נָֽתְנָה לִּ֥⁠י מִן הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	“gave me {some fruit} from that tree,” or “gave me some of the/that fruit,” See how you translated “fruit” in verses 1-6.
3:12	z2ws			וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	“so I ate {it}.” or “That is why I ate {it/some}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
3:13	lvw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים לָ⁠אִשָּׁ֖ה	1	“So Yahweh God asked the woman,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language.
3:13	vvhk			מַה זֹּ֣את עָשִׂ֑ית	1	“What have you done?” or “What did you do?” or “Tell me what you have done.” God already knew the answer to this question, but he is giving the woman a chance to confess and explain what she did. God’s question probably also implies that he is displeased with what has happened.
3:13	rhhc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר֙ הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	“But the woman said/replied {to him},” or “The woman said/replied,” or “She replied,”
3:13	n1zl			הַ⁠נָּחָ֥שׁ	1	“The snake” or “It was the serpent/snake that”. This phrase is emphasized in the Hebrew text.
3:13	w0b8			הִשִּׁיאַ֖⁠נִי	1	“tricked me,” or “lied to me,”
3:13	bews			וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	“so I ate {some of the/that fruit}.” or “That is why I ate {it/some}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
3:14	ux98			וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ יְהֹוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֥ים אֶֽל הַ⁠נָּחָשׁ֮	1	“So Yahweh God said to the snake,”
3:14	ie75			כִּ֣י עָשִׂ֣יתָ זֹּאת֒	1	“Because/Since you did that,” or “Because/Since you deceived/tricked the woman,”
3:14	dfy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אָר֤וּר אַתָּה֙	1	“you are cursed {by me}” or “I am cursing you” or “I will cause you to suffer” or “I will punish you”. In this context, “cursed” involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants, causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic.
3:14	qu53			מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה	1	“more {severely/harshly} than all the domestic/tame animals”. When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Gen 3:14, God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals. See how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20.
3:14	d3v1			וּ⁠מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל חַיַּ֣ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה	1	“and more {severely/harshly} than all the creatures/animals of/in the fields/wild.” or “and more {severely/harshly} than all the wild animals.” See how you translated “every living thing of the field” in verse 1.
3:14	obw6			עַל גְּחֹנְ⁠ךָ֣ תֵלֵ֔ךְ	1	“{As a result,} you will/must move/crawl {on/along the ground} on your belly/stomach,”
3:14	aocs			וְ⁠עָפָ֥ר תֹּאכַ֖ל	1	“and you will/must eat dust/dirt {with your food}”. Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an idiom that refers to the fact that as he slithers along, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated “dust” in Gen 2:7.
3:14	g32q			כָּל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	“your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.”
3:15	ivt7			וְ⁠אֵיבָ֣ה אָשִׁ֗ית בֵּֽינְ⁠ךָ֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה וּ⁠בֵ֥ין זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין זַרְעָ֑⁠הּ	1	“I will also cause you and the woman to be enemies {with each other}, and your offspring/descendants and her offspring/descendants to also be enemies.” or “ Besides that, I will cause you and your descendants to be enemies with the woman and her descendants.”
3:15	yfon			ה֚וּא	1	“{In fact,} her offspring/descendant” or “{In fact,} one of her descendants”. The pronoun “He” is ambiguous here. It could refer to: (1) the woman’s descendant (Jesus) who would one day come to earth as the Messiah/Christ; or (2) the woman’s descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake’s descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Messiah/Christ (“the Anointed One” or “the Promised Savior King”) who would come to earth and destroy Satan’s power (Hebrews 2:14). You could include that information in a footnote.
3:15	e3wq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יְשׁוּפְ⁠ךָ֣ רֹ֔אשׁ וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תְּשׁוּפֶ֥⁠נּוּ עָקֵֽב	1	“will strike/crush your head, and you will strike/bite/bruise his heel.” This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, “{In fact,} you will strike/bite/bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will strike/crush your head.” Do what is best in your language.
3:16	chez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֶֽל הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֣ה אָמַ֗ר	1	“{Then} he/God said to the woman,” or “{Then} Yahweh God {turned} to the woman and said {to her},” In the Hebrew text, “to the woman” comes first in this sentence, to emphasize her. Do what is natural in your language. Also consider what is the best way to refer to God here in your language.
3:16	vgi1			הַרְבָּ֤ה אַרְבֶּה֙ עִצְּבוֹנֵ֣⁠ךְ	1	“I will greatly increase how much you suffer” or “I will cause you to have/experience much/severe pain” or “I will cause it to be very painful”
3:16	d5br			וְ⁠הֵֽרֹנֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	“when you bear children;” or “when you give birth;”
3:16	icn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠עֶ֖צֶב תֵּֽלְדִ֣י בָנִ֑ים	1	“{yes/indeed,} you will suffer much pain when you give birth.” or “{yes/indeed,} bearing children will be very painful for you.” This clause is the second part of a parallelism, which emphasizes the pain and suffering that women will experience when they bear children. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation.
3:16	jbk6			וְ⁠אֶל אִישֵׁ⁠ךְ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָתֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here, because the conjunctions and the idiom “your desire will be for your husband” are all ambiguous in this context. The text could mean: (1) “Yet/But you will {still} desire/long {to be with} your husband, and he …”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Song of Songs 7:10; or (2) “Besides that, you will desire/want {to control} your husband, but he …”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Gen 4:7. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.
3:16	friw			וְ⁠ה֖וּא יִמְשָׁל בָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	“and he will control/dominate you.” or “and he will lord it over you.” See how you translated “rule over” in Gen 1:18. It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin.
3:17	sq0d			וּ⁠לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אָמַ֗ר	1	“Then/Next he/God said to the man,” or “Then/Next Yahweh God {turned} to Adam and said {to him},” In the Hebrew text, the phrase “to the man” is emphasized. See how you translated a similar case (“to the woman”) in verse 16. For a note about when to start using Adam’s name in your translation, see Gen 2:19.
3:17	dyjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּֽי־שָׁמַעְתָּ֮ לְ⁠ק֣וֹל אִשְׁתֶּ⁠ךָ֒	1	“Since/Because you {disobeyed me and} did what your wife said/suggested” or “Since/Because you did/followed what your wife told you to do”. This phrase means that Adam heard what his wife said to him and then did what she said. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
3:17	nelk			וַ⁠תֹּ֨אכַל֙ מִן הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ	1	“and ate {fruit} from the tree”
3:17	x2ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֤ר צִוִּיתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	“that I commanded/told you, ‘Do not eat {any fruit} from it,’ ” or “that I commanded you to not eat {any fruit} from.” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also see how you translated this command in verse 3.
3:17	ggfr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲרוּרָ֤ה הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽ⁠עֲבוּרֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	“the ground is cursed {by me} because of what you did.” or “I have cursed the ground because you sinned.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to break up this long sentence and say, “You did what your wife said and ate {fruit} from the tree that I commanded you not to eat {any fruit} from. Because of what you did, I have cursed the ground.” Also see how you translated “cursed” in verse 14.
3:17	wdns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	בְּ⁠עִצָּבוֹן֙ תֹּֽאכֲלֶ֔⁠נָּה	1	“{As a result,} {only} by painful toil will you eat {any food} from it” or “{As a result,} you will have to work {very} hard and suffer {to grow/get enough food} to eat”
3:17	o4tu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	“every day of your life.” or “for your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.” For some languages it is better to put this phrase before the previous clause and say, “{As a result,} for as long as you live, you will have to work {very} hard and suffer {to grow/get enough food} to eat.” Do what is best in your language.
3:18	gzbg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠ק֥וֹץ וְ⁠דַרְדַּ֖ר תַּצְמִ֣יחַֽ	1	“In fact, the ground will produce/grow thorn {plants} and thistle {plants} {and other weeds}” or “In fact, thorn bushes and thistle plants {and other weeds} will grow from the ground”. The thorn and thistle plants represent all types of weeds, which are useless and possibly harmful plants.
3:18	z3ub			לָ֑⁠ךְ וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ אֶת עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶֽה	1	The Hebrew text here could mean: (1) “{and make it difficult} for you to grow {enough} crops in the/your fields for food.” or “so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to grow/produce {enough} crops/food to eat.” or (2) “so that {your crops will not grow well and} you will {have to} eat {wild} plants that grow in the {open} fields {to survive}.” That difference of interpretation comes from the fact that the Hebrew word “fields” can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow.
3:19	ewn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠זֵעַ֤ת אַפֶּ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תֹּ֣אכַל לֶ֔חֶם	1	“{Only} by the sweat of your face/brow/forehead will you be able to {grow/produce/have} {enough} food to eat,” or “You will have to {work hard and} sweat a lot in order to {grow/produce/have} {enough} food to eat,” The phrase “by the sweat of your nose/brow” is an idiom that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. Also, bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for “bread” is used here as an idiom that refers to all food, not just bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like “food,” especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area.
3:19	n8ba			עַ֤ד שֽׁוּבְ⁠ךָ֙ אֶל הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	“until you {die and} again become dust/dirt,”
3:19	ek0a			כִּ֥י מִמֶּ֖⁠נָּה לֻקָּ֑חְתָּ	1	“which you were taken/made from {by me}.” or “which I took/created you from.” or “which I made/created you out of.”
3:19	d4o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	“Yes/Indeed,” or “That’s right,” This sentence rephrases and emphasizes what God just said.
3:19	nwc3			עָפָ֣ר אַ֔תָּה	1	“your bodies {were created/made} {by me} from dust/dirt” or “{I created/made} you out of dust/dirt”
3:19	qlcr			וְ⁠אֶל עָפָ֖ר תָּשֽׁוּב	1	“so dust/dirt is what you will become again {after you die}.”
3:20	wmrp			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֛ם שֵׁ֥ם אִשְׁתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	“Then Adam called/named his wife” or “Then the man gave his wife the name”. Some translations use Adam’s name here because he is naming Eve. See what you did in verse 17.
3:20	czch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	חַוָּ֑ה	1	“Eve, {which means “living/live,”}” If you include the meaning of Eve’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning (“living”), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis.
3:20	alel			כִּ֛י	1	“{He did that} because”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
3:20	q3ny			הִ֥וא הָֽיְתָ֖ה אֵ֥ם	1	“she would be the mother/ancestor of”
3:20	kvu6			כָּל חָֽי	1	“all the people who would ever live.” or “everyone who would ever live.”

3:21	yd2w			לְ⁠אָדָ֧ם וּ⁠לְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֛⁠וֹ	1	“for Adam and his wife {Eve},” or “for the man and his wife,”

3:22	zmrj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	“Then he said/thought,” or “Then Yahweh/he said/thought {to himself},” Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh God in your language at this point in the paragraph. Also, see how you translated a similar quote margin in Gen 1:26, where “said” has the same meaning.
3:22	tgmz			הֵ֤ן	1	“Look/Listen,” This word expresses emotion and calls attention to what God says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29.
3:22	m45e			הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	“the man {and his wife}” or “man{kind}” or “human beings”. Throughout verses 22-24 “the man” represents mankind, which included both the man and the woman at this point. Make sure your translation communicates that clearly in those verses and does not just refer to Adam.
3:22	jtzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	הָיָה֙ כְּ⁠אַחַ֣ד מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	“have become like one of us” or “have become like us”. The pronoun “us” is inclusive because God is talking to himself.
3:22	u2uz			לָ⁠דַ֖עַת ט֣וֹב וָ⁠רָ֑ע	1	“so that they know {what is} good and {what is} evil.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 5 and a similar phrase in Gen 2:9.
3:22	z722			וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה פֶּן יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לָקַח֙ גַּ֚ם	1	“So now, they must not be allowed/permitted {by us} to also take/pick” or “So we must not allow/permit them to also take/pick” or “So now we must do something so that they do/can not also take/pick”. See how you translated “took/picked … fruit” in verse 6.
3:22	jc4x			מֵ⁠עֵ֣ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּ֔ים וְ⁠אָכַ֖ל	1	“{fruit} from the tree of {eternal} life and eat {some of} it,” or “and eat {fruit} from the tree that gives people {eternal} life,” See how you translated “the tree of life” in Gen 2:9.
3:22	ekrd			וָ⁠חַ֥י לְ⁠עֹלָֽם	1	“and {then/so} live forever!” or “which will/would make them live forever!”
3:23	x97q			וַֽ⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֛⁠הוּ יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“Then Yahweh God expelled/banished the man {and his wife}” or “So {then} Yahweh God forced them to leave”. Notice that in verses 22-24, “the man”, “him”, and “he” refer to mankind, that is, the man and the woman. Make sure it is clear in your translation here that both of them were sent out of the garden, not just the man. Consider again how you translated “Yahweh God” in Genesis 2 and 3, and see the note about this at Gen 2:4. Some languages have dual pronouns that are used for “they” and “them” in verses 22-24.
3:23	kl96			מִ⁠גַּן עֵ֑דֶן	1	“the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “Eden Garden”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:15.
3:23	hhh0			לַֽ⁠עֲבֹד֙ אֶת הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	“to work/farm/cultivate the ground/land/soil”. See how you translated “work the ground” in Gen 2:5 and “work it” in 2:15.
3:23	d3re			אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֻקַּ֖ח מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	“which they had been taken/created from {by him/God}.” or “which God/he had taken/made them from.” It does not refer to the exact ground that he was made from. See how you translated “taken from” in verse 19.
3:24	j8r9			וַ⁠יְגָ֖רֶשׁ אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	“Then after he/Yahweh/God drove/forced the man {and his wife} out {of the garden},” or “After he/Yahweh/God expelled/banished them {from the garden},”
3:24	v4dm			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּן֩	1	“then he stationed” or “he placed/stationed”
3:24	zcdx			מִ⁠קֶּ֨דֶם לְ⁠גַן עֵ֜דֶן	1	“on/to the east {side} of the garden {at its entrance}” or “{at the entrance} of/to the garden, {which was} on its east side”. It is implied that the entrance to the garden is where the cherubim were placed to keep everyone from ever entering the garden again. Consider again how you translated “garden” in Gen 2:8-10, 15-16; 3:1-3, 8, 10, 23-24.
3:24	n3sj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת הַ⁠כְּרֻבִ֗ים	1	“{some} {powerful} cherubim {angels}” or “{some} {powerful beings called} cherubim {angels}”. Most translations transliterate or borrow this term from Hebrew throughout the Bible. Cherubim are a special category of very powerful angels. Each one has four faces: a human face, a lion’s face, a bull’s face and an eagle’s face (Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14). Each of them also has multiple wings. You could include some of that information in a footnote.
3:24	gndv			וְ⁠אֵ֨ת לַ֤הַט הַ⁠חֶ֨רֶב֙	1	“and a blazing/fiery/burning sword” or “and a sword made of flames/fire”. A sword is a weapon that has a very long, sharp (often two-sided) blade that is longer than a knife, machete, or dagger and is attached to a hilt or handle. This sword may have had flames coming from it, or this may have been fire in the shape of a sword.
3:24	i7zi			הַ⁠מִּתְהַפֶּ֔כֶת	1	“that was turning/swinging around in all directions” or “that was swinging/flashing back and forth”. It seems that the sword was swinging by itself since there is no mention of anyone holding it.
3:24	orao			לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֕ר אֶת דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	“to keep everyone away from the way/path {that leads/goes} to” or “so that no one could get/go near”
3:24	ar1o			עֵ֥ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּֽים	1	“the tree of {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit gives people {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit makes people live {forever}.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:9 and 3:22.
4:1	cibb			וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	“Then Adam” or “Then the man {Adam}”. For a note about when to begin referring to the man as Adam, see Gen 2:19.
4:1	k9i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יָדַ֖ע אֶת חַוָּ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“had {marital} relations with his wife Eve,” or “slept with his wife Eve,” or “was intimate with his wife Eve,” This phrase is a Hebrew idiom that means Adam had marital/sexual relations with Eve. Many languages have a similar idiom. Make sure you translate this in a way that is polite and will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud.
4:1	um2r			וַ⁠תַּ֨הַר֙ וַ⁠תֵּ֣לֶד	1	“so that she became pregnant and {later} gave birth to”. Translate this clause in a way that will not embarrass people, especially when read aloud.
4:1	a1ox			אֶת קַ֔יִן	1	“{a son they named} Cain, {which means “obtained/acquired.”}” You could include the meaning of Cain’s name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 3:20.
4:1	y3qd			וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר	1	“because she said/exclaimed,” or “{They named him that} because she/Eve had said/exclaimed,” This sentence explains how Cain got his name. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
4:1	ww1b			קָנִ֥יתִי	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “I have obtained/acquired” or (2) “I have produced/created”. If you include the meaning of Cain’s name earlier in this verse in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches your choice here so that it is clear why he was given that name.
4:1	gohm			אִ֖ישׁ	1	“a male child” or “a boy/son” or “a baby boy”. For some languages it is confusing to refer to a newborn baby as a man. Do what is clear and natural in your language.
4:1	tfqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֶת יְהוָֽה	1	“with {help from} Yahweh!” or “with Yahweh{’s help}!” For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “With Yahweh’s help I have obtained/acquired a son!” or “Yahweh has enabled/helped me to obtain/get a son!” Do what is best in your language.
4:2	gqfn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תֹּ֣סֶף לָ⁠לֶ֔דֶת	1	“Then she/Eve also gave birth to” or “After that, she/Eve gave birth to”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Cain and Abel may have been twins, or Abel may have been born sometime later after Eve became pregnant again. If possible, translate verse 2 in a way that allows for either interpretation. Also, consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun or a noun to refer to Eve here.
4:2	i71z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֶת אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1	“his/Cain’s brother” or “another baby boy, {who was} his/Cain’s brother”. Some languages have a specific term for “younger brother” that can be used here. Do what is best in your language.
4:2	wid6			אֶת הָ֑בֶל	1	“{whom they named} Abel.” or “{whose name was} Abel.”
4:2	xfso		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי הֶ֨בֶל֙	1	“Now {when the boys had grown up,} Abel” or “{When they grew up,} Abel”. This sentence introduces background information for what happens next. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Also, It is implied here that the boys had grown up to be adults. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation.
4:2	aikd			רֹ֣עֵה צֹ֔אן	1	“became/was a keeper/herder of flocks/sheep,” or “became/was a shepherd,” or “raised sheep {and goats},” A flock can be a large group of sheep or goats, or a mixture of both.
4:2	vsb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠קַ֕יִן	1	“whereas/but Cain”. Consider what is the best way in your language to contrast Cain and his work with Abel and his work.
4:2	dd6k			הָיָ֖ה עֹבֵ֥ד אֲדָמָֽה	1	“became/was a worker/tiller/farmer of the ground/soil.” or “became/was a {crop} farmer.” or “grew {food} crops.” Cain raised crops, not animals. See how you translated a similar phrase (“work the ground”) in Gen 2:5.
4:3	bwql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י מִ⁠קֵּ֣ץ יָמִ֑ים	1	“Then one day it happened that” or “As time went on/by, one day”. These phrases introduce an important new event. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.
4:3	mhjm			וַ⁠יָּבֵ֨א קַ֜יִן	1	“Cain offered/gave”
4:3	zn5b			מִ⁠פְּרִ֧י הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָ֛ה	1	“some of the crops {that he had raised/grown} in his fields” or “some of the edible plants {that he had harvested} from his farmland/fields”. The word “fruit” is general here and refers to any edible plant or crop that grows as the result of being cultivated. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
4:3	of0f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	מִנְחָ֖ה לַֽ⁠יהוָֽה	1	“to Yahweh as an offering/gift/sacrifice {to honor/worship him}.” The term “offering” refers to something that is given.
4:4	mq9z			וְ⁠הֶ֨בֶל הֵבִ֥יא גַם	1	“Abel also brought/offered/gave {an offering/gift/sacrifice} {to Yahweh}, {but what he offered/gave was}” or “But Abel offered/gave {to Yahweh}”. There is a contrast between Abel and Cain and between their offerings.
4:4	r4og			מִ⁠בְּכֹר֥וֹת צֹאנ֖⁠וֹ	1	“some of the firstborn {animals} from his flock{s}/sheep”. See how you translated “flocks” in verse 2.
4:4	oxhr			וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠חֶלְבֵ⁠הֶ֑ן	1	“and/including some of the fat portions of the meat.” or “and/including some of their best parts.” or “and/including the fattest/best parts of the animals/meat.” In that culture, fat was considered one of the best parts of an animal to eat. If that is different from how fat is viewed in your language area, that information could be put in a footnote.
4:4	v9sn			וַ⁠יִּ֣שַׁע יְהוָ֔ה אֶל	1	“Yahweh was pleased/happy with” or “Yahweh accepted”
4:4	jlf3			הֶ֖בֶל וְ⁠אֶל מִנְחָתֽ⁠וֹ	1	“Abel and his gift/sacrifice.” or “Abel and what he offered/gave {to him}.”
4:5	zedh			וְ⁠אֶל קַ֥יִן & לֹ֣א שָׁעָ֑ה	1	“But he/Yahweh was not pleased/happy with Cain” or “However, he/Yahweh did not accept Cain”. See how you translated “looked {favorably} on” in verse 4.
4:5	hxcc			וְ⁠אֶל מִנְחָת֖⁠וֹ	1	“and/or his gift/sacrifice.” or “and/or what he offered/gave {to him}.”
4:5	ai77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֤חַר לְ⁠קַ֨יִן֙ מְאֹ֔ד	1	“So Cain was/became/felt extremely angry,” Many languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.
4:5	m590		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֖וּ פָּנָֽי⁠ו	1	“and his face showed that he was angry/upset.” or “and he frowned/scowled.” or “and his face showed it.”
4:6	eymy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוָ֖ה אֶל קָ֑יִן	1	“Then Yahweh asked Cain/him,” The way you translate this quote margin should fit with the way that you translated the following three rhetorical questions.
4:6	qa15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֚⁠מָּה חָ֣רָה לָ֔⁠ךְ וְ⁠לָ֖⁠מָּה נָפְל֥וּ פָנֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	“Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning/scowling?” or “There is no need/reason for you to be angry and frowning/scowling.” God is using these rhetorical questions to correct Cain. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Also see how you translated the idioms “burned with … anger” and “face fell” in verse 5.
4:7	lltt			אִם תֵּיטִיב֙	1	“If you do {what is} right,”
4:7	ltx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֤וֹא & שְׂאֵ֔ת	1	“{you know that} you will be accepted {by me}.” or “{you know that} I will be pleased with you {and your offering/gift} {too}.” or “I will accept you {and your offering/gift} {too}.” God uses this rhetorical question here to remind Cain of something that he already knew. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.
4:7	hj95			וְ⁠אִם֙ לֹ֣א תֵיטִ֔יב	1	“But if you don’t do {what is} right,” or “But if you do what is wrong,”
4:7	re3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	חַטָּ֣את רֹבֵ֑ץ	1	“{then} sin {is like a fierce/dangerous animal that} is crouching/waiting” or “{then} sin will be crouching/waiting {like a fierce/wild animal}”. In verse 7 sin is personified, that is, it is treated as if it were alive, like a lion or some other fierce animal that wants to attack Cain. Some languages can do the same thing. Other languages cannot do that and must say something like: “then you are in great danger of being tempted to sin, but you must resist and not give in.”
4:7	sy1l			לַ⁠פֶּ֖תַח	1	“outside your door {to attack you},” or “outside the door {of your heart} {to attack/tempt you},”
4:7	t750			וְ⁠אֵלֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָת֔⁠וֹ	1	“It/Sin desires/wants {to control/destroy} you,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
4:7	r8yc			וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תִּמְשָׁל בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“but you must master/control it {so that you do not sin}.” or “but you must keep/prevent it {from controlling/destroying you}.” or “but you must keep/prevent it {from doing that}.”
4:8	hfxs			וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר קַ֖יִן	1	“But {after that,} Cain said” or “Later Cain spoke/talked”. After God spoke to Cain, we do not know how long Cain waited before he spoke to Abel; it may have been a few hours or a few days.
4:8	dhvy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	אֶל הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑י⁠ו	1	“to/with his brother Abel.” This sentence is what the Hebrew text has. Instead of that text, some ancient manuscripts and translations (including the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Latin Vulgate, and Syriac) and many modern translations have: “Then Cain said to Abel his brother, “Let’s go out to the field {and work} {together}.” ” or “Then Cain invited/asked his brother Abel to go out to the field with him {to work}.” Some translation teams follow the way this verse is translated in a well-known translation, such as in the national language or in a neighboring language. Decide what to do in your translation. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote.
4:8	bkk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ בִּ⁠הְיוֹתָ֣⁠ם בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	“Then/So {they went out} to the field {to work} {together}, and/but while they were there,” For some languages it is necessary to make explicit that Cain and Abel actually went to the field. Do what is best in your language.
4:8	dvqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֥קָם קַ֛יִן אֶל	1	“Cain attacked”
4:8	ms2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑י⁠ו	1	“his {own} brother Abel” or “his {own} brother” or “him”. The Hebrew text keeps repeating the phrase “Abel his brother” to emphasize the seriousness of Cain’s crime. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. See how you translated “brother” in verse 2.
4:8	k1e4			וַ⁠יַּהַרְגֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	“and murdered him.”
4:9	ylt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוָה֙ אֶל קַ֔יִן	1	“Then/Later Yahweh asked Cain,”
4:9	lg3y			אֵ֖י הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑י⁠ךָ	1	“Where {is} your brother Abel?” See how you translated “Abel … brother” in verse 8.
4:9	e118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	“Then He/Cain said/replied {to him},” or “He/Cain answered {him},” or “He/Cain responded/retorted,” Cain is answering Yahweh rudely. Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language, including whether or not to use a conjunction here.
4:9	pi34			לֹ֣א יָדַ֔עְתִּי	1	“I don’t know {where he is}.” or “How should I know {that}?”
4:9	d7iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠שֹׁמֵ֥ר אָחִ֖⁠י אָנֹֽכִי	1	“Am I my brother’s guardian/caretaker?” or “Am I in charge of my brother?” or “Is it my job/responsibility to take care of my brother?” or “It’s not my job/responsibility to keep track of my brother!” Cain uses this rhetorical question to support the lie that he just told. His response to God is rude and disrespectful. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question communicates that here in your language.
4:10	n5ej		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	“Then Yahweh asked/exclaimed,” Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Yahweh, not Cain.
4:10	flvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֑יתָ	1	“What you have done is very horrible/terrible!” or “You have done a horrible/terrible thing!” God uses this rhetorical question to condemn what Cain had done. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question works well here in your language.
4:10	qix1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ק֚וֹל דְּמֵ֣י אָחִ֔י⁠ךָ צֹעֲקִ֥ים אֵלַ֖⁠י מִן הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	“Your brother’s blood is calling out to me from the ground {to avenge him}!” or “Your brother’s blood on the ground is like a voice/person calling out to me {for justice/revenge}!” or “I see your brother’s blood on the ground, and/so I must judge/punish you {for killing/murdering him}!” In the Hebrew text, blood is personified, as if it had a voice or could cry out like a person does. If it is not possible to do that in your language, you could say that his brother’s blood is “like a voice …” or you could translate this sentence without personification.
4:11	ayem			וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה	1	“So/Therefore from now on” or “Because of what you did,”
4:11	nr1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אָר֣וּר אָ֑תָּה	1	“you are cursed {by me}” or “I am cursing you”. Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. Also see how you translated this in Gen 3:14.
4:11	kzep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִן הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙	1	“{so that you will not be able to grow food} from the ground/soil,” or “{so that you are banned/banished} from {working/farming} the ground/soil,”

In the Hebrew text, “the ground” is personified as if it had a mouth to open. If that is not possible in your language, you could follow one of the alternates above.
4:11	rubj			מִ⁠יָּדֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	“when/after you killed/murdered him.”

4:14	tmvv			הֵן֩	1	“Look/Listen,” This term emphasizes what Cain says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29 and 3:22. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context.

Instead of that text, some ancient translations (such as the Septuagint) and many modern translations have: “Not so/true.” or “That will not happen {because}”. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote.

If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation.

4:16	ksys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠אֶֽרֶץ נ֖וֹד	1	“in the land/region of/called Nod, {which means “wandering,”}” or “in Nod Land,” The original readers of the Hebrew text knew that the name “Nod” means “wandering”. Usually translators transliterate (copy or borrow) the name from the Hebrew text, and they might also include the meaning of the name in the text or in a footnote. If you do that here, the meaning should be similar to how you translated “wanderer” in verses 12 and 14.
4:16	glwo			קִדְמַת עֵֽדֶן	1	“{which was} east of {the land/region of/called} Eden.” or “{which was} east of Eden {Land}.” Consider again how you translated “{the land/region of} Eden” and “the Garden of Eden” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 2:8, 10, 15; 3:23-24; 4:16.

4:20	lmj0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	יֹשֵׁ֥ב אֹ֖הֶל	1	“are tent dwellers” or “live in portable shelters”. A tent is a portable living place that has walls made of cloth or animal skins and is held up by poles. Tents are used by people who need to take their home with them as they move from place to place, often to find food and water for themselves and their livestock. If people in your language area are not familiar with tents, you could include some of the above information in a footnote.
4:20	ifog			וּ⁠מִקְנֶֽה	1	“and raise livestock/animals {for a living}.” The term “livestock” includes all kinds of domestic animals, such as cows, sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys. See how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20, 3:14.

In fact, {I killed} that man {just} because he bruised/injured me!” or (2) “I killed a man for wounding me, and also a young man for bruising/injuring me.” or “A man wounded me, so I killed him. A young man injured me, so I killed him too!” According to the first interpretation, Lamech refers to one man he killed. According to the second interpretation, he refers to two men he killed.

Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language.
4:24	g912			וְ⁠לֶ֖מֶךְ שִׁבְעִ֥ים וְ⁠שִׁבְעָֽה	1	“{I,} Lamech {avenge myself} seventy-seven/77 times!” or “I {avenge myself} seventy-seven/77 times!” Lamech is bragging in verses 23 and 24 about how severely he avenges himself. He is not saying that God will avenge him more than he will avenge Cain. Also, each translation team needs to decide how they will handle numbers in the Hebrew text so that readers will not confuse those numbers with verse numbers. For example, it may be best to use words for single and double-digit numbers in the text. Be consistent with how you spelled the name “Lamech” in verses 18-19, 23-24.

4:25	yiax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ֣י	1	“{She named him that} because {when he was born,} {she had said/exclaimed},” What follows is a direct quote of what Eve said that gave Seth his name.

4:25	pmzd			שָֽׁת לִ֤⁠י אֱלֹהִים֙	1	“God has granted/given to me”. If you include the meaning of Seth’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “appointed” here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.

It also implies that they were trusting in him to help and guide them.
5:1	r7au			זֶ֣ה	1	“Here {is}” or “What follows {is}”

5:1	c3vh			בִּ⁠דְמ֥וּת אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“in his own likeness.” or “to be like himself.” God created mankind to be like himself in certain ways, but not to be exactly like him in every way (Gen 1:26-27).
5:2	sfms			זָכָ֥ר וּ⁠נְקֵבָ֖ה בְּרָאָ֑⁠ם	1	“He {also} created them {to be} male and female,” See how you translated this clause in Gen 1:27.
5:2	xoeq			וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֹתָ֗⁠ם	1	“He blessed them” or “He said/promised that he would make them prosper/flourish”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
5:2	md6q			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֤א אֶת שְׁמָ⁠ם֙	1	“and called/named them”. See how you translated the phrase “called … name” in Gen 4:17, 25, 26.

Each translation team needs to decide how they are going to write large numbers in the Bible. Many teams use numerals, for example, “130” here in verse 3, especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, “one hundred thirty” here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation.
5:3	i5yo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	בִּ⁠דְמוּת֖⁠וֹ כְּ⁠צַלְמ֑⁠וֹ	1	“who was {a human being} like himself and looked like him,” or “who was like him in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that Seth was similar to Adam in many ways.

5:4	w4va			וַ⁠יּ֥וֹלֶד	1	“and he {also} fathered/had” or “He/Adam {also} fathered/had” or “He/Adam was {also} the father of”. This clause probably refers to all the other children that Adam had, including those who were born before and after Seth was born. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

For example, many translation teams use words for single and double-digit numbers, but use numerals for larger numbers. This strategy helps prevent confusion with verse numbers. This is especially true in translations that use a large font size for verse numbers so that people doing group Bible study can easily be in the same verse together.

The events in Gen 6:1-2 started happening long before the events in 5:32, so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like “Then”, which would have the wrong meaning here. Many translations omit the conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. Also, the phrase “it happened” introduces and emphasizes important background information which the following narrative builds on. It also creates suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Some translations leave this phrase out, but doing that loses some of the suspense.

6:2	w4mk			בְנֵי הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	“{some} angels” or “{some} supernatural beings”. The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who “the sons of God” and “the daughters of mankind” refer to: (1) nonhuman, god-like (supernatural) beings, such as demons or angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7) who took human form and married the daughters of human beings (which may be what is referred to in 1 Peter 3:19–20; 2 Peter 2:4, and Jude 6); or (2) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line); or (3) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6) who married the daughters of common, poor people.

Also, see how you translated “took/married” in Gen 4:19.
6:3	fdyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	“Then/So Yahweh said {to himself},” Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language’s grammar requires it, so that your translation is easier to read and understand.
6:3	n5w7			רוּחִ֤⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “My Spirit” or “I”, which is a way of God referring to himself (Gen 1:2 is similar); or (2) “My spirit”, which could refer to God’s breath that gives life (as in Gen 2:7). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.
6:3	lxhr			לֹֽא־יָד֨וֹן & בָֽ⁠אָדָם֙ לְ⁠עֹלָ֔ם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “will not contend with human beings forever,” or “will not put up with human beings forever,” or (2) “will not remain/live with/in human beings forever,” The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.
6:3	nsna		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠שַׁ⁠גַּ֖ם ה֣וּא בָשָׂ֑ר	1	“because they {are} certainly/very sinful/corrupt.” or “because they {are} only/mere sinful/corrupt mortals.” The word “flesh” is used here as an idiom that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful/corrupt”. The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood.
6:3	u5p6			וְ⁠הָי֣וּ יָמָ֔י⁠ו מֵאָ֥ה וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָֽה	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “So they will have 120 years {to repent}.” or “I will give them 120 years {to repent}.” or (2) “{From now on,} they/people will have/live {no longer than} 120 years.” The first interpretation seems to best fit the context here of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.
6:4	ynoy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נְּפִלִ֞ים	1	“{People/Giants called} the Nephilim” or “Giants”. Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word “Nephilim” here, treating it as a name. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other time in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32-33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Gen 6:4.
6:4	mfas			הָי֣וּ בָ⁠אָרֶץ֮	1	“lived on the earth” or “were living on the earth”
6:4	x5nq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בַּ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠הֵם֒ וְ⁠גַ֣ם אַֽחֲרֵי	1	“during that time and also later on,” It may be more natural to put this time phrase first in verse 4 and say, “During that time there were Nephilim/giants living on the earth, when …” Do what is best in your language.

6:4	dopz			בְּנֵ֤י הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	“angels” or “supernatural beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this phrase in verse 2, and see the important note about that there.
6:4	pirs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יָבֹ֜אוּ & אֶל	1	“slept with” or “had {marital/sexual} relations with”. Translate this idiom in a way that is polite and will not shame or embarrass people when this verse is read aloud in public. See how you translated a similar idiom (“knew”) in Gen 4:1, 17, 25.
6:4	m59u			בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	“the daughters of human beings,” or “human women,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 2.
6:4	si43			וְ⁠יָלְד֖וּ לָ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	“and those women gave birth to children for them.” or “and those women had children.”
6:4	e4oo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֵ֧מָּה	1	“The Nephilim {were}” or “Those/Their children {grew up and} {were/became} {the Nephilim, who were}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to here.
6:4	yujd			הַ⁠גִּבֹּרִ֛ים	1	“the powerful men/warriors” or “heroes”

6:4	xhsv			אַנְשֵׁ֥י הַ⁠שֵּֽׁם	1	“{who/and were} famous men.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “They {were} the mighty men of renown who {were} from long ago.” or “They {were} the famous mighty men who lived a long time ago.” Do what is best in your language.
6:5	utlu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא יְהוָ֔ה	1	“Yahweh knew” or “Yahweh was aware”. The verb “saw” is used here as an idiom. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Do what is best in your language.

In Hebrew culture the heart is considered the center of thoughts and desires. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom.
6:5	efx7			רַ֥ק רַ֖ע	1	“{was} completely evil”
6:5	wfz7			כָּל הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	“all the time.” or “constantly.”

6:7	mt6s			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	“Then/So Yahweh/he said {to himself},” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. Also make sure that the way you begin verse 7 fits well with the way you begin verse 6.

6:8	k0ja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נֹ֕חַ מָ֥צָא חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	“But Noah pleased God.” or “However, Yahweh was pleased with Noah.” The idiom “find favor” means to please someone. And the idiom “in the eyes of” refers to someone’s opinion about something or someone. Consider whether your language has similar idioms that work well here or whether it is better to translate this sentence without an idiom.
6:9	u5k8			אֵ֚לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת נֹ֔חַ	1	“This/Here is {more of} the account/record/history of/about Noah and his descendants/family:” or “What follows tells {more} about Noah and his descendants/family:” Some of Noah’s history has already been given in Gen 5:29, 32, and 6:8. What follows tells more about him.
6:9	gw44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	נֹ֗חַ	1	“He {was}”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun or a pronoun here to refer to Noah.
6:9	zk74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אִ֥ישׁ צַדִּ֛יק	1	“an upright/good man.” or “a man who did what was right.”
6:9	w0cg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תָּמִ֥ים הָיָ֖ה בְּ⁠דֹֽרֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “He {alone} was blameless/faultless {in God’s eyes} among his contemporaries.” or “Out of all the people living at that time, Noah/he was the only one {whom God considered} blameless.” or (2) “He had a blameless/spotless reputation among his contemporaries.” or “His contemporaries considered him to be a man of integrity.” The phrase “without blemish” is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as an idiom that means Noah was “blameless/faultless” in an ethical or moral sense, or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also, the word “generation” refers here to people who lived during the same time period.
6:9	ky2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים הִֽתְהַלֶּךְ נֹֽחַ	1	“{and} he walked {closely/faithfully} with God.” or “{and} he lived in a close/faithful relationship with God.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 5:22, 24.
6:10	vdjy			וַ⁠יּ֥וֹלֶד נֹ֖חַ	1	“Eventually Noah/he fathered/had” or “And {as mentioned before,} Noah/he had”. The fact that Noah fathered/had these three sons was already mentioned in Gen 5:32. Make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation does not sound like he fathered these sons a second time.
6:10	d1np			שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה בָנִ֑ים אֶת שֵׁ֖ם אֶת חָ֥ם וְ⁠אֶת יָֽפֶת	1	“three sons, {namely} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.” or “three sons, {whose names were} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”
6:11	f221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	“Now {the people of/on} the earth had become corrupt/wicked”. The phrase “the earth” is often used in the Bible to refer to all the people on the earth. Consider whether your language can do the same thing, or whether it is necessary to make that implied information explicit.
6:11	cnh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	“in God’s sight/opinion,” or “according to God’s standards,”

The two clauses are different enough from each other that, if possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Also be consistent with how you translated “the earth” earlier in this verse.
6:12	czxe			וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	“God saw”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.
6:12	xmkj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה נִשְׁחָ֑תָה	1	“that {everyone on} the earth was indeed/very corrupt/wicked,” or “how corrupt/wicked {everyone on} the earth had become,” See how you translated “corrupt” and “the earth” in verse 11.

6:12	ldf8			הִשְׁחִ֧ית & אֶת דַּרְכּ֖⁠וֹ	1	“were living corrupt/wicked lives.” or “were {continually} doing wicked/evil things.” or “were {continually} acting/behaving in evil ways.”

The term “ark” is general and refers to a chest/box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail and no rudder. Since this was a unique, one-of-a-kind boat that may already be well-known as the “ark” in the receptor language area, some translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the word “ark” throughout Genesis. Decide what is best for your translation.

Some Bible scholars think it was cypress wood.
6:14	l2wm			קִנִּ֖ים תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֣ה אֶת הַ⁠תֵּבָ֑ה	1	“Build/Construct the ark/boat with compartments/stalls {inside},” or “Make/Build rooms inside the ark/boat,”

6:14	ch1i			בַּ⁠כֹּֽפֶר	1	“with pitch/tar {to keep water out}.” or “with pitch/tar {to keep the boat from leaking}.” The Hebrew word “covering” is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to “pitch” or “tar” or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking.
6:15	qrn8			וְ⁠זֶ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	“Build the ark/boat with these dimensions/measurements:” or “You must make/build the ark/boat like this:”

You can: (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep “cubits” in the main text (so that the numbers 300, fifty/50 and thirty/30 are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote.

See the note about “cubit” in verse 15.

Do what is natural in your language.

6:17	gjxs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י הִנְ⁠נִי֩	1	“Behold/Listen, I myself” or “Listen {carefully} to me: I”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “I” is emphatic, both by its form and by its position at the beginning of the sentence. Consider what is the best way to communicate that emphasis in your language.

6:17	cskc			כָּל בָּשָׂ֗ר	1	“all the creatures/beings” or “every creature” or “every living thing”. This phrase is general here and includes people and animals, so you may need to translate the phrase differently here from what you did earlier in verses 12-13 (where the focus seems to be on people).
6:17	wwec			אֲשֶׁר בּ⁠וֹ֙ ר֣וּחַ חַיִּ֔ים	1	“that breathe/breathes {air}”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.

Consider whether your language has a similar or different idiom that would work well here.
6:18	dkie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠הֲקִמֹתִ֥י	1	“But/However I will make/institute” or “But/However I will set up”. The word “establish” means to deliberately and formally put something into effect.

The word “testament” is another word for “covenant,” so the way you translate “covenant” here could be similar to the way you translate the titles “Old Testament” and “New Testament.”

6:20	gcv1			לְ⁠הַֽחֲיֽוֹת	1	“to keep {them} alive {on/in the ark/boat}.” or “{into the ark/boat} so that they stay alive.” or “so that you keep them alive {in the ark/boat}.”
6:21	hpvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠אַתָּ֣ה	1	“You” or “You {and your family}”. Although the pronoun “you” is singular in the Hebrew text in verse 21, it could be translated as plural, since God’s instructions apply to Noah and his family, not just Noah. Or you could make his family explicit. Do what is best in your language.
6:21	wvi8			קַח־לְ⁠ךָ֗	1	“must {also} {gather and} take/bring” or “must {also} gather”

6:21	klow			וְ⁠הָיָ֥ה & לְ⁠אָכְלָֽה	1	“This/That will be the food supply” or “so that there will be {enough} food”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.
6:21	b77w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לְ⁠ךָ֛	1	“for you {and your family}”. Consider again how you translated the pronoun “you” in this verse.
6:21	e3n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠לָ⁠הֶ֖ם	1	“and for {all} the animals.”
6:22	gvtb			וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ נֹ֑חַ	1	“So, {that is what} Noah did;” or “Noah did {all of that}”. Some translations begin verse 22 without a conjunction. Do what is best in your language.

7:1	k23r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוָה֙ לְ⁠נֹ֔חַ	1	“Then {after they had finished building the ark/boat,} Yahweh told/commanded Noah,” or “{When/After the ark/boat was finished,} Yahweh told/commanded Noah,” For some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that the boat was completed before Yahweh told Noah to enter it. Do what is best in your language.
7:1	hvzy			בֹּֽא אַתָּ֥ה וְ⁠כָל בֵּיתְ⁠ךָ֖ אֶל הַ⁠תֵּבָ֑ה	1	“Enter/Board the ark/boat, along with your entire family,” or “You and your entire household/family must go/get into the ark/boat,” See how you translated “ark/boat” in Gen 6:14-16.

7:1	cg2s			אֹתְ⁠ךָ֥ & צַדִּ֥יק	1	“{that} you {alone} {are} upright” or “{that} you {are} {the only one who is} living righteously/rightly” or “… living the right way”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “you” is emphasized to show that Noah was the only one who was righteous. See how you translated “righteous” in Gen 6:9.
7:1	ifig			לְ⁠פָנַ֖⁠י	1	“in my sight/eyes/opinion” or “according to my standards/will”
7:1	jbhc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בַּ⁠דּ֥וֹר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	“among the people living today.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “… you {are} {the only one} among the people living today {who is} righteous in my sight.” Do what is best in your language.
7:2	plj4			מִ⁠כֹּ֣ל הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֣ה הַ⁠טְּהוֹרָ֗ה	1	“From every {kind of} pure animal” or “From every {kind of} animal that is acceptable to sacrifice”. It may be necessary to include a footnote that explains the concept of clean and unclean animals: In the Bible a “clean animal” was an animal that was acceptable to be sacrificed to God or to be eaten, and an “unclean animal” was one that could not be sacrificed or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal was physically. Later Moses wrote down the laws about clean and unclean animals in the book of Leviticus.
7:2	f83c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תִּֽקַּח לְ⁠ךָ֛	1	“bring with you”. The pronoun “you” is singular in the Hebrew text, but could be translated as a plural to include Noah’s family.
7:2	mvwj			שִׁבְעָ֥ה שִׁבְעָ֖ה אִ֣ישׁ וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“seven male and female pairs”. See how you translated “male and female” in Gen 6:19.

7:3	oyjz			גַּ֣ם	1	“{and} also” or “In addition,” or “Also,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
7:3	jjfy			מֵ⁠ע֧וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֛יִם	1	“from {every kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air” or “from {every kind/type of} bird”

Also, for some languages it may be better to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “Also {take} seven male and female pairs of {every kind of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air …” Do what is best in your language.
7:3	y6qa			לְ⁠חַיּ֥וֹת זֶ֖רַע	1	“so that {later} their offspring will live” or “so that {later} they will have offspring that will live”
7:3	pazh			עַל פְּנֵ֥י כָל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“{and spread} all over the earth,” or “and/to repopulate the whole/entire earth,”
7:4	yy52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּי֩	1	“{You must do that,} because” or “The reason {you must do that} is”. For many languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
7:4	dftv			לְ⁠יָמִ֨ים ע֜וֹד שִׁבְעָ֗ה	1	“seven days from now/today”. The phrase, “seven more days” could be translated “another week” here and in verse 11. However, it is probably best to keep the number seven in the text in both places, especially since the number seven often signifies perfection or completion in the Bible, perhaps also here.
7:4	xtx7			אָֽנֹכִי֙ מַמְטִ֣יר	1	“I will make it rain {continuously}” or “I will send rain”
7:4	tldc			עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“{all} over the earth/world”
7:4	oj9l			אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם וְ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֖ים לָ֑יְלָה	1	“{for} forty days and nights,” This phrase refers to forty complete 24-hour days.
7:4	g4jc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠מָחִ֗יתִי	1	“in order to wipe/blot out” or “That will wash away” or “In that way, I will completely destroy”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 6:7.
7:4	r62g			אֶֽת כָּל הַ⁠יְקוּם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֔יתִי	1	“every living creature that I have made” or “all the living things/creatures that I have made”. See how you translated a similar phrase (“living creature”) in Gen 6:19.
7:4	ne24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	מֵ⁠עַ֖ל פְּנֵ֥י הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	“off/from the surface of the earth.” or “off/from the earth/land.” It may be clearer to put this phrase earlier in the sentence and say, “in order to completely destroy from/off the ground/earth every living creature/thing that I have made.” Do what is best in your language. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 6:7.
7:5	juaw			וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ נֹ֑חַ כְּ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר	1	“Then/So Noah did everything that” or “So Noah did everything {exactly} as”
7:5	jv8k			צִוָּ֖⁠הוּ יְהוָֽה	1	“Yahweh had commanded/told him {to do}.” See how you translated Gen 6:22 which is similar to 7:5.
7:6	r7or		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	וְ⁠נֹ֕חַ בֶּן שֵׁ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה	1	“Noah/He was 600 years old”. See how you handled large numbers in Gen 5 and in Gen 6:3, and see the note about this at Gen 5:3. Also see how you translated the idiom “son of … years” in Gen 5:32.
7:6	j0wg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠הַ⁠מַּבּ֣וּל הָיָ֔ה מַ֖יִם עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“when the flood covered the earth.” or “when the earth was covered/flooded with deep water.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “When the flood waters came on the earth, Noah was 600 years old.” Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated “floodwaters” in Gen 6:17.
7:7	xwa2			וַ⁠יָּ֣בֹא נֹ֗חַ וּ֠⁠בָנָי⁠ו וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠נְשֵֽׁי בָנָ֛י⁠ו אִתּ֖⁠וֹ אֶל הַ⁠תֵּבָ֑ה	1	“{That is when} Noah/he and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went together into the ark/boat”. Noah and his family entered the ark on the same day that the floodwaters started coming (See verses 11-13). See how you translated a similar list of people in Gen 6:18.
7:7	tiry			מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י	1	“because of” or “to escape from” or “to keep them safe from” or “so that they would not die in”
7:7	go2s			מֵ֥י הַ⁠מַּבּֽוּל	1	“the floodwaters.” or “the flood.”
7:8	tg96			מִן הַ⁠בְּהֵמָה֙ הַ⁠טְּהוֹרָ֔ה וּ⁠מִן הַ֨⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵינֶ֖נָּ⁠ה טְהֹרָ֑ה	1	“{Also,} {every kind of} clean/pure animal and {every kind of} unclean/impure animal”. See how you translated “clean” and “unclean” animals in verse 2.
7:8	wqej			וּ⁠מִ֨ן הָ⁠ע֔וֹף	1	“and {every kind of} bird,”
7:8	ca9u			וְ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר רֹמֵ֖שׂ עַל הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “including every {kind of creature/animal} that moves/lives on land,” or “which includes every {kind of creature/animal} that moves/lives on land,” According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 emphasizes that the clean and unclean animals and birds (verses 2-3, 8) were all creatures that lived on land (which are the creatures that the flood affected). Or it could mean: (2) “as well as every {kind of} creature/animal that crawls/creeps along the ground”. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 refers to a fourth category of creatures besides the clean animals, unclean animals, and birds.
7:9	nob2			שְׁנַ֨יִם שְׁנַ֜יִם בָּ֧אוּ אֶל נֹ֛חַ אֶל הַ⁠תֵּבָ֖ה	1	“came to Noah in pairs {and came/went} into the ark/boat,” or “came in pairs and entered the ark/boat with Noah,”
7:9	nt73			זָכָ֣ר וּ⁠נְקֵבָ֑ה	1	“{They were} male and female pairs,” or “Each pair had one male and one female,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
7:9	vu6n			כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר צִוָּ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת נֹֽחַ	1	“which was exactly what God had commanded/told Noah/him {to take/bring along}.”
7:10	e3k7			וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י	1	“So it happened {that}” or “Then”. This phrase focuses attention on an important event (the beginning of the flood), and it builds suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.
7:10	v4ou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠שִׁבְעַ֣ת הַ⁠יָּמִ֑ים	1	“when the seven days {that God had spoken about} had passed,” or “after seven days,” This phrase refers to the seven days which God talked about in verse 4. It does not mean seven days after Noah and the animals went into the ark (verses 7-9); they went into the ark on the same day that the flood started (verse 13). Translate the beginning of this sentence in a way that makes that clear.
7:10	vud7			וּ⁠מֵ֣י הַ⁠מַּבּ֔וּל הָי֖וּ עַל	1	“the floodwaters started to come on/over” or “water started to flood/cover”
7:10	d4xi			הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“the {entire/whole} earth.”
7:11	h4ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֨ת שֵׁשׁ־מֵא֤וֹת שָׁנָה֙ לְ⁠חַיֵּי נֹ֔חַ	1	“When Noah was 600 years old,” Compare how you translated Noah’s age in verse 6.

Do what is natural in your language.
7:11	qs0m			בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֗ה	1	“on that {same/very} day” or “that is the day when”
7:11	k61q			כָּֽל מַעְיְנֹת֙	1	“all the springs” or “all the {underground} water sources”
7:11	v29r			תְּה֣וֹם רַבָּ֔ה	1	“in the deep ocean”
7:11	dtni		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	נִבְקְעוּ֙	1	“split/ripped open,” or “started gushing/pouring out water,” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier and say, “water started gushing/pouring out of all the fountains/springs in the deep ocean,” Do what is best in your language.
7:11	d3i9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲרֻבֹּ֥ת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יִם נִפְתָּֽחוּ	1	“and {all} the windows/floodgates in the heavens/sky were opened {by God},” or “{God also caused} the water in the heavens/sky to start coming/pouring down, as if he had opened {huge} windows/floodgates/faucets {in the heavens/sky},” This metaphor describes the beginning of a very heavy rainfall; it does not refer to actual windows.
7:12	uyzz			וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י הַ⁠גֶּ֖שֶׁם	1	“so that {torrential/heavy} rain fell/poured {continuously}” or “so that it rained {continuously}”

7:12	itlr			אַרְבָּעִ֣ים י֔וֹם וְ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֖ים לָֽיְלָה	1	“{for} forty days and nights.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 4.
7:13	enc3			בְּ⁠עֶ֨צֶם הַ⁠יּ֤וֹם הַ⁠זֶּה֙	1	“{So it was/happened that} on the {very} same day {that the flood/rain started},” This is the same day that is mentioned in verse 11, when the flood started. Verses 13-16 repeat what happened, in order to emphasize it. Make sure that a translation does not sound like this is the second (or third) time that Noah and his family and the animals entered the ark.
7:13	m0hx			נֹ֔חַ וְ⁠שֵׁם וְ⁠חָ֥ם וָ⁠יֶ֖פֶת בְּנֵי נֹ֑חַ וְ⁠אֵ֣שֶׁת נֹ֗חַ וּ⁠שְׁלֹ֧שֶׁת נְשֵֽׁי בָנָ֛י⁠ו אִתָּ֖⁠ם	1	“Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, along with his wife and his sons’ three wives {all}” or “Noah and his wife and his/their sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their three wives {all}”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 7.
7:13	q42f			בָּ֣א & אֶל הַ⁠תֵּבָֽה	1	“entered/boarded the ark/boat,”
7:14	u7hi			הֵ֜מָּה וְ⁠כָל	1	“They had/took with them every”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
7:14	qs6f			וְ⁠כָל הַֽ⁠חַיָּ֣ה לְ⁠מִינָ֗⁠הּ וְ⁠כָל	1	In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It could mean: (1) “every kind of living thing/creature, including every” or (2) “every kind of wild animal, and every”. The animal groups listed in verse 14 show that every kind of animal was to be brought onto the ark. Your language may have a different way of grouping animals. Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that all the different kinds of birds and land animals are included.
7:14	nbh7			וְ⁠כָל הַ⁠בְּהֵמָה֙ לְ⁠מִינָ֔⁠הּ	1	“every kind of livestock,” or “every kind of domestic/tame animal,”
7:14	cm34			וְ⁠כָל הָ⁠רֶ֛מֶשׂ הָ⁠רֹמֵ֥שׂ עַל הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ לְ⁠מִינֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	In the Hebrew text, this phrase is ambiguous. It could mean: (1) “and every {other} kind of creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land,” which seems to fit this context best; or (2) “and every kind of creature/animal that crawls on the ground,”
7:14	hfxm			וְ⁠כָל הָ⁠ע֣וֹף לְ⁠מִינֵ֔⁠הוּ כֹּ֖ל צִפּ֥וֹר כָּל כָּנָֽף	1	“and every kind of bird {and} everything {else} that has wings.” or “and every kind of bird {and} every {other} {kind of} creature that flies.” This phrase probably refers not only to birds, but also to other creatures that have wings and fly, such as bats and insects.
7:15	an75			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥אוּ אֶל נֹ֖חַ אֶל הַ⁠תֵּבָ֑ה	1	“They came to Noah {and went/came} into the ark,” or “They entered the ark with Noah,” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 9.

7:15	kzj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר בּ֖⁠וֹ ר֥וּחַ חַיִּֽים	1	“that breathes {air}.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 6:17. For some languages it may be better to change the order of the clauses in this verse and say, “Pairs of every {kind of} living thing that breathes {air} came to Noah {and went} into the boat.” Do what is best in your language.
7:16	ihzf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וְ⁠הַ⁠בָּאִ֗ים	1	“The pairs/animals that went/came into {the ark/boat}” or “Those animals”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use “went” or “came” here. Also consider again how you translated “went” in verses 7, 9, 13, and 15.

7:16	blj8			וַ⁠יִּסְגֹּ֥ר יְהוָ֖ה בַּֽעֲדֽ⁠וֹ	1	“After that, Yahweh shut them in/inside {the ark/boat}.” or “Then {after they were all inside,} Yahweh shut/closed the door {of the ark/boat} behind him/them.”
7:17	z3pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֧י הַ⁠מַּבּ֛וּל	1	“After that the floodwaters/water kept getting deeper and deeper” or “The floodwaters/water kept coming”. Some translations begin this sentence without a conjunction. Do what is natural in your language. Also, notice that verses 17-20 talk about the forty days and nights that the flood kept getting deeper and deeper.

7:17	xy2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַרְבָּעִ֥ים י֖וֹם	1	“{for} forty days {and forty nights},” For some languages it may be more natural to put this time phrase first in this sentence and say, “{For} forty days {and forty nights} the flood kept getting deeper and deeper {all} over the earth,” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 12.

The phrase “God remembered” is an idiom in the Bible that often means God was paying special attention to certain people and was about to do something. Make sure that the way you translate this phrase does not imply that God had forgotten about Noah.

8:9	fpmf			מָנ֜וֹחַ לְ⁠כַף רַגְלָ֗⁠הּ	1	“anywhere to land/perch and rest,” In Hebrew the word “dove” is grammatically a feminine noun (for both male and female doves), so some translations say “her feet … she returned …” here. For languages such as English that do not assign grammatical gender to nouns, it is more accurate to use “its” and “it” here, because it is not known whether this dove was male or female. Do what is best in your language.

8:14	r70v			יָבְשָׁ֖ה	1	“had dried off.” In this context “dry” means that the ground was dry enough to walk on and live on without getting stuck in mud. Make sure your translation does not imply that it was so dry that nothing would grow on it (like a desert).

8:19	la0w			רוֹמֵ֣שׂ עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“that moves/lives on the ground,” or “that lives on land,” This phrase refers here to the land, not the entire planet earth. See how you translated this phrase in verse 17.
8:19	s8uv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	יָצְא֖וּ מִן־הַ⁠תֵּבָֽה	1	“{also} went/came out of the ark/boat”. Consider again how you translated “go/come out” and “went/came out” and “bring/take out” in verses 16-19. Notice that your choices are affected by your perspective: whether the viewpoint is from inside the ark or whether the viewpoint is from outside the ark. Do what is natural in your language.
8:19	j4js			לְ⁠מִשְׁפְּחֹ֣תֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	“{grouped} by their kinds.” or “in groups of their own kind.” or “one family/kind after another.”
8:20	ap9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יִּ֥בֶן נֹ֛חַ מִזְבֵּ֖חַ	1	“Then Noah built/made an altar {out of large stones}” or “Then Noah built/made a {sacrifice} table/mound {with large stones}”. An altar was an elevated, often table-shaped structure made out of stones where certain animals and crops were burned as sacrifices to God.
8:20	c6ri			לַֽ⁠יהוָ֑ה	1	“{to offer sacrifices} to Yahweh,” or “{dedicated} to Yahweh,” or “to worship Yahweh,”
8:20	penu			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֞ח	1	“Then/Next he selected/chose”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
8:20	ehez			מִ⁠כֹּ֣ל הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֣ה הַ⁠טְּהוֹרָ֗ה וּ⁠מִ⁠כֹּל֙ הָ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠טָּהֹ֔ר	1	“{some/one} from/of every {kind of} clean/pure animal and {some/one of} every {kind of} clean/pure bird,” or “{some/one} from/of every {kind of} animal and bird that are acceptable to sacrifice”. In the Bible, a “clean” animal or bird is one that is acceptable to be sacrificed to God or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal or bird was physically. See how you translated this term in Gen 7:2, 8.
8:20	rdoh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַל עֹלֹ֖ת בַּ⁠מִּזְבֵּֽחַ	1	“and he {killed them and} offered/sacrificed them as burnt offerings {to Yahweh} on the altar.” or “and he {killed them and} burned {their bodies} on the altar as offerings/gifts {to Yahweh} {to worship/honor/thank him}.” When animals were sacrificed, they were killed first, not burned alive. Consider whether or not you need to make that information explicit in your translation.
8:21	rabn			וַ⁠יָּ֣רַח יְהוָה֮ אֶת רֵ֣יחַ הַ⁠נִּיחֹחַ֒	1	“Yahweh smelled the pleasant/sweet aroma/smell {of the sacrifices},” or “When Yahweh smelled the aroma {of the sacrifices}, he was pleased,”
8:21	pjky		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה אֶל־לִבּ֗⁠וֹ	1	“and/so he said/thought to himself,” Consider whether or not your language has this idiom or a similar idiom that would work well here.

8:21	chnf			כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִֽׂיתִי	1	“as I {just} did.” or “the way I {just} did.”

8:22	v2j4			וְ֠⁠קָצִיר	1	“and harvest {time/season},” or “the time/season for harvesting/gathering {crops}”
8:22	xw8i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠קֹ֨ר וָ⁠חֹ֜ם	1	“cold {weather/season} and hot {weather/season},” These terms form a parallelism with “summer and winter”. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation since each part has a different emphasis.
8:22	io1a			וְ⁠קַ֧יִץ וָ⁠חֹ֛רֶף	1	“summer and winter,” The seasons of summer and winter may be described differently depending on which part of the world your language area is located in. For example, some translations might use the terms “dry season” and “rainy/wet season,” depending on what best corresponds to summer and winter in that area.
8:22	zj8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לֹ֥א יִשְׁבֹּֽתוּ	1	“will never cease/stop.” or “will always continue {to happen/occur} {each year}.” It may be more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “As long as the earth exists, {each year} there will always be a season/time to plant seeds and a season/time to harvest {crops}, as well as cold {weather} and hot {weather}, winter and summer, and day and night.” Do what is best in your language.
9:1	w3js			וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֱלֹהִ֔ים אֶת נֹ֖חַ וְ⁠אֶת בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	“Then God showed favor to Noah and his sons” or “Then God caused Noah and his sons to prosper/flourish”. See how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28.
9:1	xsmx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֧אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֛ם	1	“by saying to them,” or “by saying,” or “He said,” The phrase “blessed … and said” is a Hebrew expression that refers to one event and emphasizes it. It does not refer to two separate events. The words of the blessing are in verses 1-7. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:28.
9:1	ptxq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּר֥וּ	1	“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children”
9:1	ise7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	וּ⁠רְב֖וּ	1	“so that you {and your descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many”. See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” in Gen 1:28.
9:1	wnmi			וּ⁠מִלְא֥וּ אֶת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“and fill the earth {with people}.” or “and inhabit the whole earth.” or “and live/spread all over the earth/world.”

For some languages it may be better to combine the phrase and say “very afraid/terrified”. Do what is best in your language.
9:2	vgnr			וְ⁠עַ֖ל כָּל ע֣וֹף	1	“including every bird {that flies} in the sky/air,” or “including all the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” The birds, moving creatures, and fish are all included in the general category of living creatures. Consider again how you translated “birds of the sky” in the book of Genesis; see Gen 1:26, 28, 30; 2:19-20; 6:7; 7:3, 23; 9:2.
9:2	kksa			בְּ⁠כֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּרְמֹ֧שׂ	1	“{along} with every creature/animal that moves/lives on land” or “as well as all creatures/animals that move/live on land,”

9:2	vx4q			וּֽ⁠בְ⁠כָל דְּגֵ֥י הַ⁠יָּ֖ם	1	“and all the fish in the sea/ocean.”
9:2	vs4q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֥ם נִתָּֽנוּ	1	“I have put them {all} under your authority.” or “I have put you in charge of them {all}.” The phrase “into your hand” means God was again giving mankind the responsibility to manage and control all the rest of what God had created. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here.
9:3	jhft			כָּל רֶ֨מֶשׂ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הוּא חַ֔י	1	“{From now on} every {kind of} living creature/thing that moves” or “{From now on} every creature/animal that is alive and moves”. See how you translated “every moving creature” in Gen 1:26, and see the note about that there. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways in different contexts.
9:3	qntp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לָ⁠כֶ֥ם יִהְיֶ֖ה לְ⁠אָכְלָ֑ה	1	“is yours {to eat} as food.” or “is available for you {to eat} as food.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “You may {now} have/eat any {kind of} living creature that moves, for food.” or “{I now permit} you to eat every/any {kind of} living creature that moves.” Do what is best in your language.
9:3	h0u4			כְּ⁠יֶ֣רֶק עֵ֔שֶׂב	1	“green plants {for food},” or “plants {to eat},” Consider again how you translated “green plants” in Gen 1:30, and how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29; 2:5; 3:18; 9:3.
9:3	lqhk			נָתַ֥תִּי לָ⁠כֶ֖ם אֶת כֹּֽל	1	“{now} I give/provide you everything {for food}.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat everything.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat both plants and animals.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase means that God is now permitting people to eat both plants and animals.
9:4	ifut		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	אַךְ	1	“However,” God is putting a limit on the way that people may eat meat.
9:4	lov7			בָּשָׂ֕ר & לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ	1	“you must never eat {animal} flesh/meat”
9:4	goma			בְּ⁠נַפְשׁ֥⁠וֹ דָמ֖⁠וֹ	1	“that still has its life {in it}, {which is in} its blood.” or “with its blood {in it}, which made it live.” or “that still has its lifeblood {in it}.” Since life is in the blood, God did not want people to eat meat that still had its blood in it. Rather he wanted them to drain it out first before they cooked it (also see Deuteronomy 12:16, 23). You could put that information in a footnote.
9:5	rp2l			וְ⁠אַ֨ךְ אֶת דִּמְ⁠כֶ֤ם לְ⁠נַפְשֹֽׁתֵי⁠כֶם֙ אֶדְרֹ֔שׁ	1	“Also, I will definitely require an accounting/reckoning for your lifeblood.” or “Also, I definitely require that anyone who murders someone must die.”
9:5	ok4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יַּ֥ד כָּל חַיָּ֖ה	1	“From every/any animal {that kills a person}” or “{In fact,} if any animal {kills a human being},” In this verse, the phrase “the hand of” refers to the animal or the person that is responsible for killing someone.
9:5	hzwk			אֶדְרְשֶׁ֑⁠נּוּ	1	“I will demand/require its blood/life,” or “I require it to be killed,” or “I demand/require that it must die,”
9:5	yt01			וּ⁠מִ⁠יַּ֣ד הָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	“{That is also true} for human beings:” or “and {that is also true} for human beings.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
9:5	e6fe			מִ⁠יַּד֙ אִ֣ישׁ	1	“If a man/person {kills/murders}” or “If anyone {kills/murders}”
9:5	puht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אָחִ֔י⁠ו	1	“his/a fellow human being,” or “another person,” This phrase is used here as a general reference to any human being, not just biological brothers.
9:5	wf23			אֶדְרֹ֖שׁ אֶת נֶ֥פֶשׁ הָֽ⁠אָדָֽם	1	“I require him to be executed/killed.” or “I demand/require that he must die.”
9:6	i3ix			שֹׁפֵךְ֙	1	“{That’s right,} whoever” or “{Yes/Indeed,} if anyone/someone”. The first half of verse 6 repeats and summarizes verse 5.
9:6	n8bs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שֹׁפֵךְ֙ דַּ֣ם	1	“{That’s right,} whoever spills the blood of” or “{Yes/Indeed,} if anyone/someone kills/murders” or “Whoever takes the life of”. The first half of verse 6 repeats and summarizes verse 5. The phrase “sheds the blood of” is an idiom that means to deliberately kill someone. Blood is an important concept in this passage and throughout the Bible so, if possible, it is best to keep this term in a translation. If that is not possible, you should put the literal text in a footnote.
9:6	tey3			הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	“a person,” or “another human being,” or “someone,”
9:6	xvtg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בָּֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם דָּמ֣⁠וֹ יִשָּׁפֵ֑ךְ	1	“people/you must execute him,” or “people/you must put him to death,” or “he must be executed,” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “{That’s right,} you must put to death anyone who murders a human being, because {I,} God, made human beings in my own image.” Do what is best in your language.
9:6	c56p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	כִּ֚י בְּ⁠צֶ֣לֶם אֱלֹהִ֔ים עָשָׂ֖ה אֶת הָ⁠אָדָֽם	1	“because {I,} God made/created mankind/people in my {own} image.” or “because I created human beings to be like myself.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is referring to himself in this clause. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 1:27.
9:7	uion			וְ⁠אַתֶּ֖ם	1	“And/Now {as for} you,” or “As for you,” In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “you” is emphatic and has an emphatic position in the sentence (before the verb) to introduce a new topic. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin a new paragraph like this.
9:7	mt4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּר֣וּ	1	“bear/have many children”. See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply” in verse 1.
9:7	mi6k			וּ⁠רְב֑וּ	1	“so that you {and your descendants} become {very} numerous/many.” or “so that you have many descendants.”
9:7	in4s			שִׁרְצ֥וּ בָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	“Spread out all over the earth” or “Live all over the earth”
9:7	s5nm			וּ⁠רְבוּ	1	“and multiply/increase {in numbers}” or “and become numerous”
9:7	jl94			בָֽ⁠הּ	1	“throughout it.” or “everywhere.”

9:8	bm0t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אֶל נֹ֔חַ וְ⁠אֶל בָּנָ֥י⁠ו אִתּ֖⁠וֹ לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	“to Noah and his sons {who were} with him, and said,” or “to Noah and his sons,” or “to them,” God is still speaking to the same people. This phrase emphasizes what he says next to them.
9:9	ycb0			וַ⁠אֲנִ֕י הִנְנִ֥⁠י	1	“Now listen {carefully} to me: I” or “Listen {carefully} to me: I” See how you translated “behold” in Gen 1:29, 4:14, 6:13, 17. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
9:9	pujm			מֵקִ֛ים	1	“am making/instituting” or “am setting up”. See how you translated “establish my covenant with” in Gen 6:18, and see the note about that there.
9:9	g76x			אֶת בְּרִיתִ֖⁠י אִתְּ⁠כֶ֑ם וְ⁠אֶֽת זַרְעֲ⁠כֶ֖ם אַֽחֲרֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	“my/a {special/peace} covenant/agreement with you and your offspring/descendants {who come/live} after you,” or “my/a covenant/agreement between me and you and your offspring/descendants,” Notice that the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural throughout verses 2-15, since God is speaking to Noah and his sons.
9:10	c62u			וְ⁠אֵ֨ת	1	“along with” or “{It is} also with” or “{The covenant/agreement is} also with”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up this long sentence and begin a new sentence here.
9:10	rys5			כָּל נֶ֤פֶשׁ הַֽ⁠חַיָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתְּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	“all the living creatures that {are} with you:”
9:10	o3v5			בָּ⁠ע֧וֹף בַּ⁠בְּהֵמָ֛ה	1	“including the birds, the livestock,”
9:10	tzzr			וּֽ⁠בְ⁠כָל חַיַּ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	“and all the {other} living things/creatures from/on the earth” or “and all the wild animals”

9:10	mxmq			מִ⁠כֹּל֙ יֹצְאֵ֣י הַ⁠תֵּבָ֔ה	1	“{That includes} all {those} that came/went out of the ark”. The words “from … to …” are used to emphasize that all the animals are included in God’s covenant. Consider what is the best way to express that in your language.
9:10	kqlk			לְ⁠כֹ֖ל חַיַּ֥ת	1	“and all the living things/creatures” or “and all the creatures/animals”
9:10	gq32			הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“{that live} on the earth.” or “{that will ever live} on the earth.”

9:11	jown			וְ⁠לֹֽא יִהְיֶ֥ה ע֛וֹד מַבּ֖וּל	1	“That’s right, never again will {I use/cause} a flood” or “{I promise that} I will never again use/cause a flood”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
9:11	mxo7			לְ⁠שַׁחֵ֥ת	1	“that destroys”. See how you translated “destroying” in Gen 6:13.
9:11	euoi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“{life/everything on} the earth.” or “{all living creatures on} the earth.” This phrase refers here to everything that lives on the earth.

For some languages it is more natural to leave this quote margin implied and just have a paragraph break. See what you did for a similar case in verse 8.
9:12	htun			זֹ֤את אֽוֹת הַ⁠בְּרִית֙ אֲשֶׁר אֲנִ֣י נֹתֵ֗ן	1	“This {is} the sign {which shows} {that I promise to always keep} the covenant/agreement that I am making/establishing” or “This is how I will show/remind {everyone} that I have made/established this covenant/agreement”

9:15	jg40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠זָכַרְתִּ֣י אֶת בְּרִיתִ֗⁠י	1	“then I will remember {and keep} my/the covenant/agreement” or “then I will not forget {to keep/fulfill} my/the covenant/treaty”. See how you translated “remember” in Gen 8:1. It may need to be translated differently in different contexts.
9:15	cl8q			אֲשֶׁ֤ר בֵּינִ⁠י֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ינֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	“that {I have established/made} between me and you” or “that I have established/made with you”

Make sure it is clear in your translation that this last clause in verse 15 is what God promised in his covenant. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
9:15	ha7y			כָּל־בָּשָֽׂר	1	“all life.” or “all living creatures.” or “all people and animals.”
9:16	msfb			וְ⁠הָיְתָ֥ה הַ⁠קֶּ֖שֶׁת	1	“So/Yes, whenever the/a rainbow appears/forms” or “{That is how it will be:} Whenever there is a rainbow”. In verse 16, God repeats and emphasizes what he said in verses 12-15.

See how you translated a similar clause in verse 12. In that verse God is explaining the rainbow for the first time, whereas here in verse 17, he is pointing back to what he just said about the rainbow in order to emphasize its importance. Also, consider again how you translated “covenant” in verses 9, 11-13, 15-17.

See Gen 6:12-13, 17; 7:21; 9:11, 15-17. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways in different contexts.

The pronoun “he” is emphatic here, emphasizing that Ham was the father of Canaan, who is probably mentioned here because he was well known as the ancestor of the Canaanites and the one whom the land/region of Canaan was named after.

If necessary, you could make that explicit here. Also, if grapes are not known in your language area, you could say “vines/plants with a fruit called grapes”, or you could put in a footnote information about grapes, including how they are squeezed and how the juice is fermented to make wine.
9:21	w1ox			וַ⁠יֵּ֥שְׁתְּ מִן הַ⁠יַּ֖יִן	1	“Then {one day} he drank {too much of} the wine,” or “{One day} he drank a lot of the wine,”

9:24	e13r			וַ⁠יֵּ֕דַע	1	“and he found out” or “and he heard {about}”. The text does not say how Noah found out about this, so it is best to not be too specific about that here in your translation.

9:25	dvbz			עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים	1	“the lowest slave/servant”. The Hebrew word here can mean either “slave” or “servant”. Slaves in the Old Testament were usually treated well and were not much different than servants, sometimes even becoming like members of their owner’s family. But they were of lower status than their masters, which is part of how Ham’s family is being cursed.
9:25	dnvn			לְ⁠אֶחָֽי⁠ו	1	“for his/Canaan’s relatives.” Verses 26 and 27 show that “his brothers” probably refers here to Shem and Japheth (who were Canaan’s uncles) and their descendants.

10:4	iwl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּתִּ֖ים וְ⁠דֹדָנִֽים	1	“the Kittites and the Dodanites.” or “the Kitt people {group} and the Dodan people {group}.” Most translation teams transliterate people group names in the Bible, but handle the suffix endings in different ways. For example, you could: (1) transliterate the Hebrew plural suffix “-im”; or (2) use a suffix that your language has for names of people groups (such as “-ites” in English); or (3) translate “-im” as “people” or “people/ethnic group.” Try to be consistent in how you handle people group names throughout this chapter and the rest of the book of Genesis.
10:5	swml			מֵ֠⁠אֵלֶּה	1	“From those/Japheth’s {descendants}”. This phrase probably refers to Japheth’s descendants (verses 2-4), especially since the descendants of his brothers Ham (verse 20) and Shem (verse 31) are summarized in a similar way.

Also, for some languages it may be clearer to change the order of the phrases in this verse and say, “Japheth’s descendants spread out and settled near/by the {Mediterranean} Sea. They all formed their own family groups, which {grew/multiplied and} became their own people groups that spoke their own languages and lived in their own territories/regions.” Do what is best in your language.

10:19	m5gx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠צִּידֹ֔ן	1	“from {the city of} Sidon {in the north},” or “from Sidon {City} {in the north},” Some languages have an affix or a word (that means “city”) that must be used every time the name of a city is mentioned or the first time a particular city is mentioned in a paragraph or section. Do what is natural in your language here and elsewhere throughout the Bible.
10:19	juim		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בֹּאֲ⁠כָ֥ה גְרָ֖רָ⁠ה עַד עַזָּ֑ה	1	“all the way {down/south} toward {the city of} Gerar to {the city of} Gaza,” or “{down/south} to Gaza {City}, which is on the road to Gerar {City},” The Canaanites’ border reached Gaza, but did not extend down to Gerar, which was farther south.

10:20	mrbd			אֵ֣לֶּה	1	“Those {are/were} {the names of}” or “Those {men/people} {are/were}”. The word “Those” refers back to the people listed in verses 6-19. Also, many translations that use “were” (and other past tense verbs) in verses 2-19 and 21-30 use “are” here (and in verses 31 and 32). Do what is best in your language.
10:20	w958			בְנֵי חָ֔ם	1	“the descendants of Ham” or “Ham’s sons/descendants”
10:20	ixjv			לְ⁠מִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	“according to their family groups,” or “and each one had his own clan/family,” or “and their {extended} families,” See how you translated “clans” in verse 5.

See how you translated verse 5, which has some of the same phrases as verse 20.
10:21	am4z			וּ⁠לְ⁠שֵׁ֥ם יֻלַּ֖ד גַּם	1	“Shem also fathered/had {some} sons”. In the Hebrew text, “to Shem” comes first in this sentence after “And”, to emphasize Shem. Do what is natural in your language.
10:21	x6vj			ה֑וּא אֲבִי֙ כָּל בְּנֵי עֵ֔בֶר	1	“He was the ancestor of all the descendants of Eber”
10:21	f29s			אֲחִ֖י יֶ֥פֶת הַ⁠גָּדֽוֹל	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “and his/Shem’s older brother was Japheth.” (2) “and he/Shem was Japheth’s older/oldest brother.”
10:22	t2s3			בְּנֵ֥י שֵׁ֖ם	1	“{The names of} Shem’s sons {were}” or “These {were} {the names of} Shem’s sons:”

Also, see how you spelled “Lud” in verse 13 (who is a different person with the same name). Be consistent with how you spell each name throughout the Bible.
10:23	ylhl			וּ⁠בְנֵ֖י אֲרָ֑ם	1	“{The names of} Aram’s sons {were}” or “These {were} {the names of} Aram’s sons:”
10:23	qqox			ע֥וּץ וְ⁠ח֖וּל וְ⁠גֶ֥תֶר וָ⁠מַֽשׁ	1	“Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.” The same person who is called “Mash” here, is referred to as “Meshech/Meshek” in 1 Chronicles 1:17. To prevent confusion, some translations use “Meshech/Meshek” here too, or they put that name in a footnote.
10:24	u3c2			וְ⁠אַרְפַּכְשַׁ֖ד יָלַ֣ד אֶת שָׁ֑לַח	1	“Arpachshad/Arphaxad fathered/had {a son named} Shelah,” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Arpachshad/Arphaxad” in verse 22.

10:25	ibtk			פֶּ֗לֶג	1	“Peleg, {which means “division/divide,”}” You can put the meaning of Peleg’s name in the text or in a footnote, so that it is clear why he was given his name. See what you did for a similar case (Noah’s name) in Gen 5:29.

10:25	po91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠שֵׁ֥ם אָחִ֖י⁠ו יָקְטָֽן	1	“His/Peleg’s {younger} brother’s name was Joktan.” or “{Eber’s second/other son} was named Joktan and was younger than Peleg.” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to in this sentence, especially after reading the previous two sentences.
10:26	eu4k			וְ⁠יָקְטָ֣ן יָלַ֔ד	1	“Joktan fathered/had {sons named}” or “Joktan fathered/had {the following sons:}” Notice that the list of Joktan’s sons continues through verse 29.

10:30	qhqk			בֹּאֲ⁠כָ֥ה סְפָ֖רָ⁠ה	1	“all the way to” or “as far as”
10:30	buoh			סְפָ֖רָ⁠ה	1	“{the city/town of} Sephar, {which is in/near}”. Sephar might refer to a city, a mountain, or a region (that was named after the city or mountain).
10:30	bl54			הַ֥ר הַ⁠קֶּֽדֶם	1	“the mountain range {that is} in the east.” or “the hill country in the east.” or “the eastern hill country.” The word “mountain{s}” is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It can be: (1) a collective noun that refers to mountains or hill country near the town of Sephar; or (2) a singular noun that refers to a specific mountain that was called Sephar.
10:31	v7ly			אֵ֣לֶּה	1	“Those {are/were} {the names of}” or “Those {men/people} {are/were}”. The word “Those” refers here to the people listed in verses 21-30. See how you translated verse 20, which is almost exactly the same as verse 31.
10:31	ffht			בְנֵי שֵׁ֔ם	1	“the descendants of Shem” or “Shem’s sons/descendants”
10:31	lpn7			לְ⁠מִשְׁפְּחֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	“and each one had his own clan/family.” See how you translated “clans” in verses 5 and 20.

Consider again how you translated “clans” in verses 5, 18, 29, 31-32.
10:32	bl71			לְ⁠תוֹלְדֹתָ֖⁠ם בְּ⁠גוֹיֵ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	“Each clan/family had its own genealogy/descendants and became its own people/ethnic group.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, compare how you translated similar phrases in verses 5, 20, and 31.
10:32	nh8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠מֵ⁠אֵ֜לֶּה נִפְרְד֧וּ הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֛ם בָּ⁠אָ֖רֶץ אַחַ֥ר הַ⁠מַּבּֽוּל	1	“From those {people} {came/descended} {all} the people/ethnic groups {who} spread out on/over the earth after the flood.” or “In fact, after the flood {all} the people groups on the earth descended from them and spread out everywhere.” Consider again how you translated “nations” in verses 5, 20, 31-32.
11:1	r2b8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י כָל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ שָׂפָ֣ה אֶחָ֑ת	1	“Now {at first,} everyone on the earth spoke/shared the same language” or “Now {for a while,} all {the people on} the earth spoke one language”. The events in chapter 11:1-9 happened before the people listed in chapter 10 had their own languages and before they spread out over the earth (Gen 10:5, 19-20, 30-32). You could include some of that information in a footnote.
11:1	l2n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וּ⁠דְבָרִ֖ים אֲחָדִֽים	1	“and {spoke/shared} the same words/vocabulary.” or “and spoke words everyone knew/understood.” or “so that everyone understood each other.” The phrases “one language” and “the same words” are very similar in meaning and emphasize the fact that everyone spoke the same language. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
11:2	ufks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י	1	“After a while, as/when” or “As/When” or “As time passed,” The phrase “it happened that” introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Some translations omit this phrase because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language.
11:2	phjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠נָסְעָ֣⁠ם	1	“they moved/traveled” or “the people migrated/moved”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun (“they”) or a noun phrase (“the people”) here.
11:2	kqit			מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	“from the eastern {regions},” or “{around} in the eastern {regions},” At first after the flood, people lived in the regions around the mountains of Ararat (where the ark had landed). As they began to migrate and spread out to different places (as God had told them to do), they must have headed south at some point since they ended up at the plain of Shinar, which was south of where the Ararat Mountains were. The reference to “the east” probably reflects the viewpoint of the author (Moses), since the Ararat mountains and the plain of Shinar were both far to the east of where he was living.
11:2	zdwp			וַֽ⁠יִּמְצְא֥וּ	1	“they discovered” or “they {eventually} came to” or “and {eventually} came to”. Make sure the way you translate this phrase fits with the way you translated the first half of this verse.
11:2	vygx			בִקְעָ֛ה בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ שִׁנְעָ֖ר	1	“a wide/spacious, flat valley/area in the land/region called Shinar”. This plain was a wide, flat area between mountains. Also be consistent here with how you translated “land of Shinar” in Gen 10:10.
11:2	dxfo			וַ⁠יֵּ֥שְׁבוּ שָֽׁם	1	“and lived/stayed there.” or “and began to live there.”
11:3	m2g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֞וּ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֗⁠הוּ	1	“Then {one day} they urged each other,” The events that are described below probably did not happen immediately after they arrived at the plain. Consider what is the best way to begin these events in your language.
11:3	jfqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הָ֚בָ⁠ה	1	“Come on,” Consider whether or not your language has an idiom like this that is used to urge or persuade someone to do something together.
11:3	uwu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נִלְבְּנָ֣ה	1	“let us {work together and} make” or “we should {work together and} make”. The pronoun “us” is inclusive here and refers to the people who are talking to each other.
11:3	wprr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְבֵנִ֔ים	1	“{some} {clay/mud} bricks/blocks” or “{some} bricks/blocks {from clay/mud}”

11:3	b4kx			לַ⁠חֹֽמֶר	1	“instead of mortar.” or “to hold/stick the bricks/blocks together.”
11:4	rlly			וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֞וּ	1	“Then they said {to each other},” or “Then they urged {each other},”
11:4	igxx			הָ֣בָ⁠ה	1	“Come on,” See how you translated this idiom in verse 3.
11:4	gfzh			נִבְנֶה	1	“let us {work together and} build” or “we should {work together and} build”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 3.

11:4	z87w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נַֽעֲשֶׂה לָּ֖⁠נוּ שֵׁ֑ם פֶּן נָפ֖וּץ	1	“{We should do that} to make ourselves famous and to keep us from spreading out” or “{That way} we will become well-known/famous, and we will not separate from each other {and live}”. The phrase “make a name for ourselves” is a idiom. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also see how you translated the word “scattered” in Gen 10:18, 32.
11:4	ytfe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַל פְּנֵ֥י כָל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“all over the earth/world.” or “around the world.”
11:5	f9ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֣רֶד יְהוָ֔ה	1	“Then/But {one day} Yahweh came down {from heaven}”
11:5	oe6q			לִ⁠רְאֹ֥ת אֶת הָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	“and looked at the city” or “and inspected the city”. The text implies that Yahweh actually looked at the city. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to make that explicit here.
11:5	pbs0			וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠מִּגְדָּ֑ל	1	“and the {very} tall building”. See how you translated this word in verse 4.
11:5	ujao			אֲשֶׁ֥ר & בְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠אָדָֽם	1	“that the people”
11:5	zcoi			בָּנ֖וּ	1	“were building.” or “had started building.” Make sure the way you translate this verb fits with the fact that the people had not yet finished building the city (verse 8).
11:6	zesy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	“And/Then he said (to himself),” or “He said,” Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language.
11:6	h94b			הֵ֣ן	1	“Look,” This term calls attention to what Yahweh says next. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.
11:6	q2ld			עַ֤ם אֶחָד֙	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “{they are} one people/ethnic {group},” or (2) “the/these people {are} one/united {in what they are doing},”
11:6	emr9			וְ⁠שָׂפָ֤ה אַחַת֙ לְ⁠כֻלָּ֔⁠ם	1	“and they all speak/share the same language.” See how you translated “have one language” in verse 1.
11:6	jn1z			וְ⁠זֶ֖ה הַחִלָּ֣⁠ם לַ⁠עֲשׂ֑וֹת	1	“This {is} {only} the beginning of what they can/will do {together}.”

Consider what is the best way to translate this in your language.
11:7	siye			הָ֚בָ⁠ה	1	“{So} come on,” or “{So}”
11:7	ab2t			נֵֽרְדָ֔ה & שָׁ֖ם	1	“we must go down there {now}” or “let us go to them”. Most Bible scholars think the plural pronoun “us” refers here to God and the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep this plural pronoun in your translation. See what you did for similar pronouns in Gen 1:26.
11:7	b6e9			וְ⁠נָבְלָ֥ה & שְׂפָתָ֑⁠ם	1	“and scramble their language” or “and mix up their language”
11:7	qlnr			אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ	1	“so that they will not {be able to} understand” or “so that they cannot understand”
11:7	yf9e			אִ֖ישׁ שְׂפַ֥ת רֵעֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	“what they say to each other.” or “each other.”
11:8	abaf			וַ⁠יָּ֨פֶץ יְהוָ֥ה אֹתָ֛⁠ם מִ⁠שָּׁ֖ם	1	“Then/So Yahweh {did that and} caused the people to leave from there and spread out” or “That is how Yahweh caused the people to leave from there and settle/live in different places”
11:8	m39c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַל פְּנֵ֣י כָל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“over the surface of the entire earth,” or “all over the earth/world,”

11:8	fvq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	“the city {and the tower}.” or “the city {and the tall building}.” For some languages it is better to change the order of clauses in this verse (so that events are in the order that they happened) and say, “In that way, Yahweh caused the people to stop building the city {and the tower} and to move away from each other, {so that eventually they lived} all over the world.” Do what is best in your language.
11:9	o1v3			עַל כֵּ֞ן	1	“That is why”
11:9	grok			קָרָ֤א שְׁמָ⁠הּ֙	1	“people named the/that city” or “the name of the/that city is” or “the/that city was named/called”. Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific.
11:9	flf8			בָּבֶ֔ל	1	“Babel, {which means “confused/mixed-up/scrambled,”}” If you include the meaning of “Babel” here in your translation or in a footnote, be consistent with the way you translate “confused” later in this verse and in verse 7.
11:9	go0s			כִּי שָׁ֛ם & יְהוָ֖ה	1	“because that is where Yahweh” or “because {it was} in that city {that} Yahweh”
11:9	cnun			בָּלַ֥ל	1	“mixed up” or “scrambled”
11:9	f8ye			שְׂפַ֣ת כָּל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“the language that everyone on the earth spoke/shared,”

11:9	onj2			עַל פְּנֵ֖י כָּל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“over the surface of the entire earth.” or “all over the earth/world.” See how you translated this phrase in verses 4 and 8.
11:10	k4zv			אֵ֚לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת שֵׁ֔ם	1	“This/Here is the record/list of Shem’s descendants:” or “This is Shem’s genealogy/family-line:”

Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Arpachshad/Arphaxad” in Gen 10:22.

Throughout this section, make sure that names and pronouns (like “he”) are used in a way that is accurate and natural in your language, so that it is always clear who is being referred to.

For some languages, it may be more natural to change the clause order of this sentence and say, “Shem lived 500 {more} years after Arpachshad/Arphaxad was born …” Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter.
11:11	e9d9			וַ⁠יּ֥וֹלֶד	1	“and he {also} fathered/had” or “He/Shem {also} fathered/had” or “He/Shem was {also} the father of”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this phrase and the following one in Gen 5:4.

Also, throughout this chapter, be consistent with how you have decided to handle numbers in the Bible. For example, many translation teams use words for single and double-digit numbers, but use numerals for larger numbers. This strategy helps prevent confusion with verse numbers. This is especially true in translations that use a large font size for verse numbers so that people doing group Bible study can easily see the numbers and be in the same verse together. See what you did in chapter 5.

In fact, Abram was not born until Terah was at least 130 years old (11:32, 12:4-5; Acts 7:4), and he was probably Terah’s youngest son. Abram is listed first (instead of Haran or Nahor) probably because of his importance as the one whom Yahweh made His covenant with. Some of this information could be put in a footnote.

This phrase refers to Abram and his descendants, including ultimately the Messiah. In other words, God’s promise in this verse is part of his wonderful news (the Gospel message) for all people (Galatians 3:8-9) and is a prophecy about the Messiah/Christ, who was one of Abraham’s descendants (Matthew 1:1, Genesis 22:18, Galatians 3:16). God blessed all people on earth by sending his Son Jesus (the Messiah/Christ) to die in their place and pay for all their sins (John 3:16-18, 1 Timothy 2:3-6), so that they could have a close relationship with him/God and be part of his family forever. God repeats this great promise in Genesis 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

For some languages it is more natural to make “son of his brother” or “his nephew” explicit in verse 4 (where Lot is first mentioned in this section) and leave it implied here in verse 5. Do what is best in your language.
12:5	af34			וְ⁠אֶת כָּל רְכוּשָׁ⁠ם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָכָ֔שׁוּ וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠נֶּ֖פֶשׁ אֲשֶׁר עָשׂ֣וּ	1	“everything that they owned, including slaves/servants {and everything else} they had acquired/gotten”. The word “possessions” is general here and includes slaves, animals, furniture, clothes, and money. See how you translated “slave” or “servant” in Gen 9:25-27.
12:5	v8yx			בְ⁠חָרָ֑ן	1	“in {the city of} Haran,” or “in Haran {City}

12:6	ep53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֤ר אַבְרָם֙	1	“Abram traveled/went” or “Abram {and his family} traveled/went” or “they traveled/went”. Abram is the only one named here because he is in focus. However, your translation should not sound like he traveled alone in verse 6. Also make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation fits with the way you ended verse 5.
12:6	o804			בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“through that land/region”. See how you translated “land” in verse 5.
12:6	ai2i			עַ֚ד	1	“until they arrived at” or “to”
12:6	klyk			מְק֣וֹם שְׁכֶ֔ם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “the city of Shechem,” or (2) “the/a {sacred} place at/near {the city of} Shechem,”
12:6	wf66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עַ֖ד אֵל֣וֹן מוֹרֶ֑ה	1	“to Moreh’s terebinth/oak tree.” or “to the terebinth/oak tree on Moreh’s land.” Moreh is probably the name of the person who owned the land where the terebinth tree was. A terebinth tree is a large, broadleaf, flowering tree in the cashew family that can grow to a height of 5 to 12 meters (16 to 40 feet). The Hebrew words for “oak” and “terebinth” are similar, so many translations (including LXX) translate this as “oak tree” here. Notice, however, that oak trees and terebinth trees are from two different families of trees.
12:6	aje0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֖י אָ֥ז בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“At/During that time the Canaanites {were still living} in that land/region,” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put the time phrase (“at that time”) first in this sentence.
12:7	nqjy			וַ⁠יֵּרָ֤א יְהוָה֙ אֶל אַבְרָ֔ם	1	“Then/but Yahweh came to Abram” or “but Yahweh visited Abram”. Yahweh’s promise in verse 7 to give Canaan to Abram’s descendants contrasts with the fact that the Canaanites were still occupying that region (verse 6). Also, notice that the text does not specify in what form or in what way God appeared to Abram, so your translation should not do that either.

However, for some languages it may be clearer and more natural to change the order of the clauses and say, “I will give this land to your offspring/descendants.” Do what is best in your language.

12:9	yypr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נֶּֽגְבָּ⁠ה	1	“{south} toward the Negev/Southern {Wilderness/Desert}.” or “{southward} until they reached the Negev/Southern {Wilderness/Desert}.”The Hebrew word “Negev” can mean “south” or “dry country,” so some translations translate the meaning. But most translations transliterate the Hebrew name (as “Negev” or “Negeb”) as they do with other names in the Bible.
12:10	glm2			וַ⁠יְהִ֥י	1	“Now there was”. This clause gives the setting for the rest of the sentence. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.
12:10	eik8			רָעָ֖ב	1	“a serious/extreme shortage/lack of food” or “a hungry/starving time when food was very/extremely scarce”. A “famine” is a prolonged period of time when people are starving because crops are failing, often due to a lack of rain or other severe weather conditions.
12:10	wayf			בָּ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“in that land/region/area,” or “in the Negev Wilderness/Desert,”

Also, the term “Pharaoh” is an Egyptian title that refers to the king or ruler over Egypt. However, in the Old Testament, it is treated as a name (that frequently occurs with the title “king of Egypt”), so translators often transliterate “Pharaoh” (which is how other names in the Bible are normally treated). Some languages require an honorific title with the names of kings, for example, “{King} Pharaoh”. Decide how you will handle this in your translation.

13:4	tq1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א שָׁ֛ם אַבְרָ֖ם בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥ם יְהוָֽה	1	“There {again} Abram/he {sacrificed animals on the/that altar and} addressed Yahweh by {his} name as he worshiped/praised him.” or “So Abram/he {again} {used that altar} there {and} worshiped/praised Yahweh by name.” or “… worshiped/praised Yahweh.” See how you translated “called on the name of Yahweh” in Gen 12:8.
13:5	mqte		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠גַם לְ⁠ל֔וֹט הַ⁠הֹלֵ֖ךְ אֶת אַבְרָ֑ם הָיָ֥ה	1	“Lot was traveling with {his uncle} Abram, and he {and his family} also had/owned”. The word “Now” introduces more background information for the new episode. For some languages it is more natural to leave “Now” implied and just use a paragraph break. Do what is best in your language.
13:5	r7v1			צֹאן וּ⁠בָקָ֖ר	1	“flocks {of sheep and goats} and herds {of cattle}” or “many sheep and cattle”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 12:16.
13:5	q7sx			וְ⁠אֹהָלִֽים	1	“and {many} tents.” or “as well as {many} tents.”
13:6	zhy2			וְ⁠לֹא־נָשָׂ֥א אֹתָ֛⁠ם הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	“As a result, there was not enough land to provide them {all} with enough food and water” or “In fact, there was not enough land to provide/have enough food and water for both families {and their livestock/animals}”

The phrase “their possessions” especially refers to their livestock, which required much land to graze on and much water to drink, and probably also includes their many servants. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
13:6	nfu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָֽכְל֖וּ לָ⁠שֶׁ֥בֶת יַחְדָּֽו	1	“they could not {all} live near each other.” or “it was not possible for them to {all} live in the same area/region.” See how you translated a similar phrase earlier in this verse. For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “In fact, they {each/both} owned so many servants and livestock/animals that they could not live in the same area. There was not enough land to provide/produce the amount of food and water that they {all} needed.” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “stayed together” earlier in this verse.
13:7	wfy2			וַֽ⁠יְהִי	1	“In fact,” or “As a result,”
13:7	qb77			וַֽ⁠יְהִי רִ֗יב	1	“there was conflict/arguing” or “arguments/quarreling erupted/started”. The Hebrew word for “strife” is general in meaning and can include arguing and fighting. Some languages have an idiom for this that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.

13:8	a1pw			וּ⁠בֵ֥ין רֹעַ֖⁠י וּ⁠בֵ֣ין רֹעֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	“or/nor between the men tending my livestock and the men tending your livestock,” or “or/nor between our herdsmen,” See how you translated “herdsmen” in verse 7.
13:8	d9nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי אֲנָשִׁ֥ים אַחִ֖ים אֲנָֽחְנוּ	1	“because/since we {are} men {who are also} brothers/relatives.” or “because/since we {are} close relatives.” Abram and Lot were close relatives, not actual brothers. Also, for some languages it may be better to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “Please, since we {are} close relatives, we need to do something so that you and I and our herdsmen will not argue.” Do what is best in your language.
13:9	sm7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֤א כָל הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙ לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“Look, the entire land is available to you {to choose from}.” or “You can {choose to} live anywhere in this entire land.” Abram is using a rhetorical question to emphasize his point. He does not expect an answer from Lot. If that is not clear, you can translate this as a statement.
13:9	ad9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הִפָּ֥רֶד נָ֖א מֵ⁠עָלָ֑⁠י	1	“Please {choose the land you want, and} let’s go our separate ways.” or “Please {choose where you want to live, and} let’s live in separate places.” Make sure it is clear in your translation of verse 9 that Abram is being kind to Lot, not mean or rude.
13:9	oj9a			אִם הַ⁠שְּׂמֹ֣אל	1	“If {you choose} {the land to} the left {of here},” or “if {you decide to live} {in the land to} our left,”

13:10	r14f			כְּ⁠גַן יְהוָה֙	1	“{It was lush and green} like the garden that Yahweh had planted,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated “garden” in Gen 3:23-24. This phrase refers to the Garden of Eden. You could put that information in a footnote.

Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use Lot’s name or a pronoun to refer to him here.
13:11	re87			מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “to/toward the east {to live there}” or “eastward” or (2) “from the east”
13:11	h78o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּפָּ֣רְד֔וּ אִ֖ישׁ מֵ⁠עַ֥ל אָחִֽי⁠ו	1	“So {in this way} they lived separately from each other.” or “That is how Abram and Lot ended up living in separate/different places.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also consider what is the best way to refer to Abram and Lot at this point in the paragraph.
13:12	eqvk			אַבְרָ֖ם יָשַׁ֣ב	1	“Abram settled/stayed {where he was}” or “Abram continued to live”

As Lot traveled, he probably lived in several different cities in the Jordan River Valley until he eventually settled in the city of Sodom (Gen 14:12).
13:12	tu8e			וַ⁠יֶּאֱהַ֖ל עַד	1	“He {eventually} pitched his tents in/near” or “and {eventually} moved his tents to/near”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

13:13	qquc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אַנְשֵׁ֣י סְדֹ֔ם	1	“But the people {who lived} in {the city of} Sodom”. The conjunction “Now/But” introduces background information that builds suspense for what happens to the people of Sodom later in Genesis (chapters 18-19). Consider what is the best way to begin this verse in your language. Also, this phrase probably has a general meaning here that includes all the people of Sodom, especially the men.
13:13	ussh			רָעִ֖ים & מְאֹֽד	1	“{were} extremely/very wicked/evil”
13:13	a8b1			וְ⁠חַטָּאִ֑ים לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה	1	“were {terrible} sinners against Yahweh.” or “were {always/constantly} sinning/rebelling against Yahweh.” Some translations treat the phrase “wicked and sinful” as a hendiadys that means “wicked sinners”, but it is best to keep the two parts of this phrase separate (like the Hebrew text does) to emphasize the people’s evil character and behavior.
13:14	cxs0			וַֽ⁠יהוָ֞ה אָמַ֣ר אֶל אַבְרָ֗ם אַחֲרֵי֙ הִפָּֽרֶד ל֣וֹט מֵֽ⁠עִמּ֔⁠וֹ	1	“After Lot had left Abram, Yahweh said to Abram,”
13:14	grqj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	שָׂ֣א נָ֤א עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	“Look around please/now” or “Look {all} around you”. See how you translated the idiom “lift … eyes” in verse 10. The Hebrew word for “please” is used to show politeness when making a proposal or to soften a command. It can also be translated “now” or omitted, depending on the context. Your translation here should not sound like God is begging.
13:14	pmid		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	מִן הַ⁠מָּק֖וֹם אֲשֶׁר אַתָּ֣ה	1	“from the place where you {live},” or “from where you {are standing},” For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase first in this quote and say, “From where you are standing, look {all} around you.

13:16	h6lr			כַּ⁠עֲפַ֣ר הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“as {numerous as} the {specks of} dust/dirt on the earth,” See how you translated “dust/dirt” in Gen 3:19.
13:16	rtyn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִם יוּכַ֣ל אִ֗ישׁ לִ⁠מְנוֹת֙	1	“Just as it is impossible to count” or “Just as no one is able to count”. The Hebrew text has a contrary-to-fact clause here which implies that it is impossible for anyone to count all the specks of dust. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
13:16	it85			אֶת־עֲפַ֣ר הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“all the dust/dirt specks/particles,” or “how many specks/particles of dust/dirt there are,” For some languages it is not natural to repeat “of/on the earth” here. Do what is best in your language.
13:16	tjyw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	גַּֽם זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ יִמָּנֶֽה	1	“so it will be impossible to count all your offspring/descendants {because they will be so numerous}.” or “no one will be able to count how many descendants you have.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of the last two clauses and say, “No one will be able to count how many offspring/descendants you have, just as no one can count how many {specks/particles of} dust/dirt there are.” Do what is best in your language.
13:17	hsbz			ק֚וּם הִתְהַלֵּ֣ךְ	1	“{Now} go walk” or “{So now,} start walking”. The phrase “get up” may imply that Abram was sitting down, but it probably just means that God is telling him to start walking through the land.
13:17	vbbt			בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“through/throughout the land {in all directions},”
13:17	hdl5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	לְ⁠אָרְכָּ֖⁠הּ וּ⁠לְ⁠רָחְבָּ֑⁠הּ	1	“including its length and its width, {and look it over,}” or “Walk/Go throughout the entire land {and look it over},” The phrase “its length … its width” also includes all the area of land in between. Consider what is the best way to translate this merism in your language. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
13:17	j72c			כִּ֥י לְ⁠ךָ֖ אֶתְּנֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	“because you {are the one} I am giving it to.” or “because I am giving it {all} to you.” In the Hebrew text, the phrase “to you” is before the verb to emphasize Abram. In your translation, communicate this emphasis in a way that is natural in your language.
13:18	evru			וַ⁠יֶּאֱהַ֣ל אַבְרָ֗ם	1	“Then Abram {did what Yahweh commanded} and moved his tents” or “Abram {obeyed Yahweh and} moved/relocated his tents”. Abram obeyed God, but we do not know if he did everything that God commanded in verse 17 before he moved his tents near Hebron (verse 18), or if moving his tents was the first step in obeying what God told him to do. It is best to keep this general in your translation (as the Hebrew text does). Also see how you translated the phrase “moved his tents” in verse 12.
13:18	uf3q			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֛א וַ⁠יֵּ֛שֶׁב	1	“and went to settle/live” or “and settled”

14:1	rxaj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-keyterms	אַמְרָפֶ֣ל מֶֽלֶךְ	1	“Amraphel {was} the king/ruler over” or “King Amraphel was ruling”. The term “king” refers to the highest ruler or leader over a kingdom, which at that time was often just a city, a small region or a people group. Translate this with the best word for that in your language. Also see how you translated “Shinar” in Gen 10:10; 11:2.
14:1	x729			שִׁנְעָ֔ר	1	“{the land/region of} Shinar,”
14:1	abfg			אַרְי֖וֹךְ מֶ֣לֶךְ	1	“Arioch {was} the king/ruler over” or “King Arioch was ruling”. It is not known whether Ellasar was the name of a city or the name of a kingdom that had one or more cities.

In Hebrew this king’s name is pronounced “Kedorlaomer”. However in many translations it is spelled “Chedorlaomer”. Be consistent with your choice throughout this chapter. Also, “Elam” refers to the land where the descendants of Shem’s son Elam lived (Gen 10:22).

The Salt Sea, also known as the Dead Sea, is about 31 miles (50 kilometers) long and 9 miles (15 kilometers) wide. Use a term in your language for a body of water that size.

The first alternate above would work for either meaning. See how you translated “wine” in Gen 9:21, 24.

Abram’s oath to Yahweh made Yahweh his witness who would hold him accountable and punish him if he were to break his oath.
14:22	j9qr			אֵ֣ל עֶלְי֔וֹן	1	“{who is} the highest/greatest God,” See how you translated this phrase in verses 18-20.
14:22	v040			קֹנֵ֖ה שָׁמַ֥יִם וָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“{and} the Owner/Creator of heaven and earth,” or “{and} the One who owns/created heaven and earth,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 19.
14:23	xn0s			אִם	1	“{that} I will not {keep/accept}”
14:23	lbqa			מִ⁠חוּט֙ וְ⁠עַ֣ד שְׂרֽוֹךְ נַ֔עַל	1	“even a thread/string or the strap from a sandal,” or “even {something as small/insignificant as} a {piece of} string or a sandal strap,”
14:23	wb28			וְ⁠אִם אֶקַּ֖ח מִ⁠כָּל	1	“No/Yes, I will not keep/accept anything”. This clause emphasizes Abram’s point. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
14:23	ah9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	“that {belongs} to you {or your people},” or “that is yours {or your people’s},” For some languages, it may be clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “{that} I will not keep/accept anything that {belongs} to you {or your people}, not even {something as small as} a {piece of} thread/string or the strap from a sandal.” Do what is best in your language.
14:23	hns6			וְ⁠לֹ֣א תֹאמַ֔ר	1	“That way you can never say,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
14:23	xhbz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲנִ֖י הֶעֱשַׁ֥רְתִּי אֶת אַבְרָֽם	1	“I {am the one who} made Abram rich/wealthy!” or “that you {were the one who} made me rich.” The Hebrew pronoun that refers here to the king of Sodom is emphatic. Consider what is the best way to communicate that emphasis in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote.
14:24	kk1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	בִּלְעָדַ֗⁠י רַ֚ק	1	“{So} I {will} not {keep/accept} anything, except” or “{So} I {will} only {keep/accept}”. Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this exception sentence.
14:24	kaz7			אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָֽכְל֣וּ הַ⁠נְּעָרִ֔ים	1	“what my servants {who fought with me} have eaten” or “what my men/warriors ate”. These young men were Abram’s trained servants or warriors who are mentioned in verses 14-15.
14:24	pp7i			וְ⁠חֵ֨לֶק֙ הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָלְכ֖וּ אִתִּ֑⁠י עָנֵר֙ אֶשְׁכֹּ֣ל וּ⁠מַמְרֵ֔א	1	“and the share/part {of the plunder} that Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre deserve for being my allies/partners.” or “and what Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre deserve for helping me in the battle.”
14:24	h54m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הֵ֖ם יִקְח֥וּ	1	“{Please} let them take/have” or “{Please} give them”. Abram is being polite, but make sure in your translation that he does not sound like he is begging, especially since he is a mighty warrior.
14:24	umi6			חֶלְקָֽ⁠ם	1	“their share/part {of the plunder}.” or “their share/part {of what we recovered}.”
15:1	gh9e			אַחַ֣ר הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה	1	“After those things/events {happened},” or “After that,”

Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like what Abram saw was unreal; what he saw and heard actually happened.
15:1	qg0x			אַל תִּירָ֣א אַבְרָ֗ם	1	“Abram, do not be afraid!”
15:1	a97c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָנֹכִי֙ מָגֵ֣ן לָ֔⁠ךְ	1	“I {am} your shield/protector,” or “I protect you {like} a shield,” or “I will shield/protect you,” God is like a shield to Abram since he protects him. Consider what is the best way to translate this metaphor in your language.
15:1	dbve			שְׂכָרְ⁠ךָ֖ הַרְבֵּ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “{and} your reward {from me} will be very great.” or “{and} I will give you a very great/valuable reward/gift.” (2) “{and} {I am} your very great/valuable reward.” The context (verse 2) shows that the first interpretation is what Abram understood God to be saying.
15:2	vwfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָ֗ם	1	“Then Abram said/lamented {to him},” or “But/Then Abram asked {him},” The way you translate this quote margin may depend on how you translate the following rhetorical question.
15:2	n8qe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	אֲדֹנָ֤⁠י יֱהוִה֙	1	“My Master Yahweh,” or “Yahweh my Lord/Master,” The phrase “My Lord” means that Yahweh owns Abram and has complete authority over him, just as a master (at that time) had complete authority over his servant.
15:2	ep5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה תִּתֶּן לִ֔⁠י	1	“what {reward} will/can you give to me {that would benefit me},” or “{I don’t understand} how a reward from you {would benefit/help} me,” or “even if you reward me {greatly}, {that will not benefit/help me,}” Abram uses this rhetorical question to show that he is lamenting that he has no children. Make sure in your translation that he does not sound rude.
15:2	ifre			וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֖י הוֹלֵ֣ךְ עֲרִירִ֑י	1	“since I remain childless” or “I still have no children”
15:2	dltw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠בֶן מֶ֣שֶׁק	1	“so that {when/after I die,} the inheritor/heir of” or “So {when I die,} the one who will inherit/own”. The phrase “son of the inheritance” is used here as an idiom that means “inheritor” or “heir”; it does not refer to an actual son. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
15:2	gn01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בֵּיתִ֔⁠י	1	“my estate/property” or “all/everything that I have/own”. This phrase refers here to all Abram’s belongings.
15:2	nc22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	דַּמֶּ֥שֶׂק אֱלִיעֶֽזֶר	1	“{is} {my foreign servant} Eliezer from Damascus” or “{is} {my servant} Eliezer {who is} {a foreigner} from {the city of} Damascus”. In the Hebrew text, Abram emphasizes the fact that Eliezer was from Damascus, which means he was a foreigner from a foreign city, not a blood relative. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “{the city of} Damascus” in Gen 14:15.
15:3	jv86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָ֔ם	1	“Then he continued/added,” Some languages omit these words, because the same speaker is still speaking to the same audience. Do what is best in your language.
15:3	im0k			הֵ֣ן	1	“Look/Indeed,” Some translations omit this phrase to prevent Abram from sounding rude. Do what is best in your language.
15:3	o4j4			לִ֔⁠י לֹ֥א נָתַ֖תָּה זָ֑רַע	1	“you have not given me any children,” In the Hebrew text “to me” is before “you have not given” to emphasize Abram. Do what is natural in your language.
15:3	w212			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	“so that now {when/after I die},”
15:3	zvm0			בֶן בֵּיתִ֖⁠י	1	“a servant from my household” or “one of my household servants”
15:3	ojds			יוֹרֵ֥שׁ אֹתִֽ⁠י	1	“will be my heir!” or “will inherit/get everything I own!”
15:4	nsoi			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	“But immediately” or “Immediately”
15:4	os3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	דְבַר יְהוָ֤ה אֵלָי⁠ו֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1	“Yahweh said/replied to him/Abram,” See how you translated this idiom in verse 1. It may be necessary to translate it differently here because of the different context.
15:4	mxfc			זֶ֑ה	1	“{No,} that man/servant” or “{No,} your servant {Eliezer}”
15:4	lns8			לֹ֥א יִֽירָשְׁ⁠ךָ֖ & כִּי אִם֙	1	“will not inherit/get your estate/property, rather”
15:4	o38q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-Idiom	אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֵצֵ֣א מִ⁠מֵּעֶ֔י⁠ךָ ה֖וּא	1	“a son whom you father” or “it will be your very own {biological} son who”. The phrase “comes from your bowels” is an idiom that refers to fathering a child. Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that Abram would give birth to a son.
15:4	hr4c			יִֽירָשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	“will inherit/own your estate/property.” or “will inherit/own it.”
15:5	ww36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יּוֹצֵ֨א אֹת֜⁠וֹ	1	“Then Yahweh took/led him/Abram”. Consider what is the best way in your language to refer to Yahweh and Abram at this point in the paragraph.
15:5	gdld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠ח֗וּצָ⁠ה	1	“outside {his tent}”. Abram was probably inside a tent, not inside a house. But if possible, it is best to leave this implied in a translation (as the Hebrew text does).
15:5	p6yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	“and said {to him},”
15:5	vwsk			הַבֶּט נָ֣א	1	“Please/Now look {up}” or “Look {up}”. See how you translated “please” in Gen 13:14. Make sure your translation does not sound like God is begging.
15:5	zhiv			הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֗יְמָ⁠ה	1	“into the heavens” or “at/into the {night} sky”
15:5	i9uf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	וּ⁠סְפֹר֙ הַ⁠כּ֣וֹכָבִ֔ים אִם תּוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠סְפֹּ֣ר אֹתָ֑⁠ם	1	“and {try to} count how many stars there are, if {in fact,} anyone could {possibly} count {all of} them.” or “There are so many stars that no one could {ever/possibly} count them {all}.” God’s point here is that there are so many stars that no one could ever count that high. He is not questioning Abram’s ability to count. Consider what is the best way to translate this contrary-to-fact statement in your language.
15:5	uudh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר ל֔⁠וֹ	1	“{While Abram was looking at the stars,} Yahweh said to him/Abram,” or “{So Abram looked up at the stars,} and Yahweh continued speaking to him,” Throughout this chapter make sure it is clear in your translation who is speaking to whom. Always use pronouns and nouns in a way that is clear and natural in your language.
15:5	fv94			כֹּ֥ה יִהְיֶ֖ה זַרְעֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	“That is how {numerous/many} your offspring/descendants will be.” or “That is how many offspring/descendants you will have.”
15:6	obq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הֶאֱמִ֖ן	1	“He/Abram trusted/believed Yahweh,” or “He/Abram believed what Yahweh said,” Many translations omit the conjunction “And” here. Do what is best in your language. Also, make sure it is clear in your translation that Abram is the subject here, not Yahweh (who was the last subject in verse 5).
15:6	nhkm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּחְשְׁבֶ֥⁠הָ לּ֖⁠וֹ צְדָקָֽה	1	“and {so} Yahweh counted/credited it/that to him {as} righteousness.” or “and because of that, Yahweh considered/reckoned him/Abram to be righteous.” or “so Yahweh considered him/Abram to have a right relationship with him.” Notice that Yahweh is now the subject again. Make sure it is clear in your translation who is speaking to whom here and throughout this section.
15:7	il2v			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר אֵלָ֑י⁠ו	1	“Then Yahweh said to him/Abram,”
15:7	jwqc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	אֲנִ֣י יְהוָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֤ר הוֹצֵאתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ מֵ⁠א֣וּר	1	“I {am} Yahweh who brought/led you {here} from {the city of} Ur”
15:7	j8wd			כַּשְׂדִּ֔ים	1	“which is ruled/inhabited by the Kasdim/Chaldeans” or “that the Kasdim/Chaldeans rule” or “where the Kasdim/Chaldeans live”. See how you translated “Ur of the Kasdim/Chaldeans” in Gen 11:28, 31, and see the note about that there.
15:7	vfmv			לָ֧⁠תֶת לְ⁠ךָ֛ אֶת הָ⁠אָ֥רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֖את	1	“to give this land to you”
15:7	g9jd			לְ⁠רִשְׁתָּֽ⁠הּ	1	“to own.” or “as your homeland.” or “to be your own/home.”
15:8	vtol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	“Then/But Abram said/replied {to him},” or “Then/But he/Abram asked {him},” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Abram is the one speaking here, not Yahweh.
15:8	yj8m			אֲדֹנָ֣⁠י יֱהוִ֔ה	1	“My Lord/Master Yahweh,” or “Yahweh my Lord/Master,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 2.
15:8	i68u			בַּ⁠מָּ֥ה אֵדַ֖ע	1	“how will/can I know {for sure}” or “how will/can I be certain/sure”
15:8	auft			כִּ֥י אִֽירָשֶֽׁ⁠נָּה	1	“that I will possess/own this land/territory?” or “that this land will be mine?”
15:9	m3dc			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֗י⁠ו	1	“Yahweh said/replied to him/Abram,” or “Yahweh replied,”
15:9	i00p			קְחָ֥⁠ה לִ⁠י֙	1	“Bring me”

15:9	x5l7			וְ⁠אַ֣יִל מְשֻׁלָּ֑שׁ	1	“and a male sheep that is three years old”. For some languages it may be more natural to shorten this list of animals and say, “Bring to me a {young} cow, a female goat, and a male sheep, each of which is three years old,” Do what is best in your language.
15:9	h03l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠תֹ֖ר וְ⁠גוֹזָֽל	1	“as well as a turtledove/dove and a young pigeon.” Turtledoves and pigeons are common, closely related birds that look similar and are often gray or grayish brown in color. One of the main differences is that turtledoves are smaller than pigeons. Compare how you translated “dove” in Gen 8:8.
15:10	haes			וַ⁠יִּֽקַּֽח	1	“So {the next/following day} Abram brought/took”. It was nighttime in verse 5 when Abram looked at the stars. Now in verses 10-11 it was probably daytime, which is when birds of prey fly (verse 11). Then in verse 12 it became night again. Consider what is the best way to begin this verse in your translation.
15:10	rm6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ל֣⁠וֹ אֶת כָּל אֵ֗לֶּה	1	“all those {animals} to him/Yahweh {and slaughtered/killed them}.” Some languages need to make explicit that Abram killed the animals first, before cutting them in half. Do what is best in your language.
15:10	lz42			וַ⁠יְבַתֵּ֤ר אֹתָ⁠ם֙	1	“Then/Next Abram cut/divided the animals’ bodies”
15:10	qlm4			בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ	1	“in half lengthwise” or “into two parts lengthwise”. Abram probably cut the animals down the middle lengthwise, which means that each half had one front leg, and one back leg.
15:10	zyln			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֥ן אִישׁ־בִּתְר֖⁠וֹ לִ⁠קְרַ֣את רֵעֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	“and placed/arranged each half a short distance/space across from the/its other half {in two rows},” or “and laid/arranged the right half of each animal opposite/across from its left half {in two rows},”
15:10	g80e			וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠צִפֹּ֖ר לֹ֥א בָתָֽר	1	“but he did not cut/divide {the bodies of} the birds in two/half.” or “except for the birds, which he did not cut in two/half.” See how you translated “cut … in two” earlier in verse 10.
15:11	dhk0			וַ⁠יֵּ֥רֶד הָ⁠עַ֖יִט	1	“Then {some} birds of prey landed” or “Then {some} vultures flew/swooped down {and landed}” or “Then {some} meat-eating birds”. This phrase refers to large birds that eat dead animal meat. Examples of these birds include vultures, buzzards, condors, eagles, and crows.
15:11	p4wl			עַל־הַ⁠פְּגָרִ֑ים	1	“the {dead} animal bodies/parts {to eat them},” or “the dead animals {to eat them},”
15:11	xeat			וַ⁠יַּשֵּׁ֥ב אֹתָ֖⁠ם אַבְרָֽם	1	“but Abram chased/scared them away.” or “but Abram made them go away.”
15:12	e39m			וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	“Then it happened {that}” or “Later”. This phrase adds suspense and makes the reader wonder what will happen next. Many translations leave it out, but if possible it is best to keep it in your translation.
15:12	d33t			הַ⁠שֶּׁ֨מֶשׁ֙ לָ⁠ב֔וֹא	1	“as/when the sun was going down” or “as/when it was starting to become dark/night”
15:12	l3t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠תַרְדֵּמָ֖ה נָפְלָ֣ה עַל אַבְרָ֑ם	1	“Abram fell/went into a deep/sound sleep,” or “Abram went soundly asleep,” See how you translated a similar idiom in Gen 2:21.
15:12	f59z			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	“and suddenly,” or “Then suddenly,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

15:13	pj1f			זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֗	1	“your descendants”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 5.
15:13	wscw			גֵ֣ר יִהְיֶ֣ה	1	“will live as foreigners/sojourners”. The word “strangers” refers to people who live temporarily in a city, country, or region, but they do not settle there permanently.
15:13	cm9l			בְּ⁠אֶ֨רֶץ֙	1	“in a country”
15:13	sd2n			לֹ֣א לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	“that is not their own.” or “that is not their home/homeland.”
15:13	d6oi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠עֲבָד֖וּ⁠ם	1	“They will serve the people {of/in that land/country} {as slaves},” or “They will be servants/slaves for the people {who live in that land/country},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, make sure that your translation of these pronouns clearly communicates who is being referred to.
15:13	kntb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠עִנּ֣וּ אֹתָ֑⁠ם	1	“and those people will oppress/mistreat them” or “and those people will treat them cruelly/badly”. Notice that here the pronoun “they” refers to the people who were living in the country where Abram’s descendants will be sojourning and “them” refers to Abram’s descendants. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
15:13	hx9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָֽה	1	“{for} 400 years.” or “{for a period of} 400 years.” This phrase refers to how long Abram’s descendants would live in a land that is not theirs, not how long they would be oppressed, which was less than half of those 400 years. To make that clear in your translation, you could move this phrase earlier and say: “I want you to know that for 400 years your offspring/descendants will live in a land/country that is not their own, and the people of that country will oppress them.”
15:14	r32f			וְ⁠גַ֧ם	1	“But” or “But/And you can also be certain/sure that”
15:14	kuy4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת הַ⁠גּ֛וֹי	1	“{the people of} that nation/country” or “the/those people”
15:14	tbec			אֲשֶׁ֥ר יַעֲבֹ֖דוּ	1	“whom they serve {as slaves}” or “who made them slaves”
15:14	dvzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	דָּ֣ן אָנֹ֑כִי	1	“I will punish,” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “But I will also judge/punish {the people of} the nation that they serve”. Do what is natural in your language.
15:14	rxgp			וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי כֵ֥ן	1	“After that,” or “Then”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
15:14	bwpf			יֵצְא֖וּ	1	“your offspring/descendants will leave {that land/country}”
15:14	hshe			בִּ⁠רְכֻ֥שׁ גָּדֽוֹל	1	“with many possessions.” or “with great/much wealth.” or “and take many possessions/riches with them.” See how you translated “possessions” in Gen 14:16, 21.
15:15	lnj7			וְ⁠אַתָּ֛ה	1	“Now/But {as for} you,” or “As for you,” In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “you” is emphatic and has an emphatic position in the sentence (before the verb) to change the topic. Do what is clear and natural in your language.
15:15	yeva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	תָּב֥וֹא אֶל אֲבֹתֶ֖י⁠ךָ בְּ⁠שָׁל֑וֹם	1	“you will be at peace when you {die and} join your forefathers/ancestors {who have died/gone before you}”. This clause is a euphemism that refers to Abram’s death. However, it is best to translate the clause as literally as possible, since it implies the important information that people are still alive after they have died on earth. Also, notice that the term “fathers” refers here to ancestors who have died, not those who are still alive on earth.
15:15	wwh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	תִּקָּבֵ֖ר בְּ⁠שֵׂיבָ֥ה טוֹבָֽה	1	“{In fact,} you will not die until you have lived a good/blessed, long life.” or “{In fact,} you will live a good/blessed, long life before you die.” This clause is a euphemism that refers to Abram’s death. Make sure in your translation that it does not sound like he will be buried alive. For some languages it may be more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “after you have lived a good/blessed long life, you will die peacefully and join your ancestors {who have died before you}.” Do what is best in your language.
15:16	pycy			וְ⁠ד֥וֹר רְבִיעִ֖י	1	“Then four generations later,” or “Then after four generations {have passed},”
15:16	vmew			יָשׁ֣וּבוּ הֵ֑נָּה	1	“your descendants will return here {to live},” or “your descendants will come back to this land {and live here},”

Consider whether or not to include that implied information in your translation or in a footnote. Also, see how you translated the names of people groups in Gen 10:13-18.
15:17	pz6x			וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	“Then it happened {that}”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 12, and see the note about that there.
15:17	epqp			הַ⁠שֶּׁ֨מֶשׁ֙ בָּ֔אָה	1	“when/after the sun had gone down,” or “when/after the sun had set,” The sun had started to go down in verse 12. Here it had completely set.
15:17	s3qr			וַ⁠עֲלָטָ֖ה הָיָ֑ה	1	“it was/became {very} dark”. This Hebrew word for “darkness” implies that it was darker than normal, so that not even light from the moon and stars was visible.
15:17	gctf			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	“and suddenly,” or “Then suddenly,” For some languages it is better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

15:18	trnn			בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֗וּא	1	“On that {very} day” or “At that time”. It is still nighttime at this point (See: verse 17), so the word “day” refers generally here to a 24-hour day; it does not refer to daytime.
15:18	fchr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-Idiom	כָּרַ֧ת יְהוָ֛ה	1	“Yahweh established/made”
15:18	zmuv			אֶת אַבְרָ֖ם בְּרִ֣ית	1	“a {special/peace} covenant/agreement with Abram”. See how you translated “covenant” in Gen 9:9, 11-13, 15-17.

15:18	nifa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֗ נָתַ֨תִּי֙ אֶת הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֔את	1	“I am giving your offspring/descendants this land,” or “I hereby give this land to your offspring/descendants,” In the Hebrew text “to your offspring/descendants” is first in this quote to emphasize Abram’s descendants. Do what is natural in your language.
15:18	g5es			מִ⁠נְּהַ֣ר מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	“{which extends} from Egypt’s river {in the south}”. This phrase probably refers to the Wadi El-Arish (not the Nile River), which is on the border between Egypt and Israel. It is best in a translation to leave this general as the Hebrew text does.
15:18	wiap			עַד הַ⁠נָּהָ֥ר הַ⁠גָּדֹ֖ל נְהַר פְּרָֽת	1	“to the great/big Euphrates River {in the north},”
15:19	dwlz			אֶת	1	“{including} {the land which is owned/inhabited by}” or “{That is/includes} {the land which belongs to}”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
15:19	ba00			אֶת הַ⁠קֵּינִי֙ וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠קְּנִזִּ֔י וְ⁠אֵ֖ת הַ⁠קַּדְמֹנִֽי	1	“the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,” or “Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,” In a list of people group names like this (verses 19-21), for some languages it is more natural to leave out “and” and “the” most of the time. Do what is natural in your language.
15:20	t17t			וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠חִתִּ֥י וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠פְּרִזִּ֖י וְ⁠אֶת הָ⁠רְפָאִֽים	1	“the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim/Rephaites,” or “Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaim/Rephaites,” Be consistent here with how you translated “the Hittites” in Gen 10:15, “the Perizzites” in Gen 13:7, and “the Rephaim/Rephaites” in Gen 14:5.
15:21	tiio			וְ⁠אֶת הָֽ⁠אֱמֹרִי֙ וְ⁠אֶת הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֔י וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠גִּרְגָּשִׁ֖י וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠יְבוּסִֽי	1	“the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.” or “Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.” Be consistent here with how you translated “the Amorites” in verse 18 and “Amorites”, “Canaanites”, “Girgashites”, and “Jebusites” in Gen 10:15-18.
16:1	j5rh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שָׂרַי֙ אֵ֣שֶׁת אַבְרָ֔ם	1	“Sarai, Abram’s wife,” or “Now Abram’s wife Sarai”. This verse begins a new topic and gives background information about Sarai. Some languages have a special conjunction for this. Other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is best in your language.
16:1	itjv			לֹ֥א יָלְדָ֖ה ל֑⁠וֹ	1	“{still} had not had {any} children for him,” or “had {still} not given birth {to any children} for him,” Sarai’s barrenness is first mentioned in Gen 11:30.
16:1	ck1v			וְ⁠לָ֛⁠הּ	1	“but she owned” or “but she did have”
16:1	oni8			שִׁפְחָ֥ה מִצְרִ֖ית	1	“an Egyptian slave/servant woman” or “a female slave/servant from {the country of} Egypt”. See how you translated “female slaves/servants” in Gen 12:16.
16:1	gj9y			וּ⁠שְׁמָ֥⁠הּ הָגָֽר	1	“whose name was Hagar.” or “named Hagar.”
16:2	hcuf			וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר שָׂרַ֜י אֶל אַבְרָ֗ם	1	“So she told Abram,” or “Then Sarai/she told Abram,”
16:2	hjtg			הִנֵּה נָ֞א	1	“Listen please/now:” or “Please listen {to me/this}:” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 12:11.

16:2	pxu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	בֹּא נָא֙ אֶל	1	“please sleep with” or “please have {marital/sexual} relations with”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the previous sentence. Also, see how you translated the idiom “went to” in Gen 6:4.
16:2	b34m			שִׁפְחָתִ֔⁠י	1	“my slave/servant woman {Hagar}.” See how you translated “maidservant” in verse 1.
16:2	u5c8			אוּלַ֥י	1	“Maybe” or “{so that} perhaps/maybe”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
16:2	mcq5			אִבָּנֶ֖ה מִמֶּ֑⁠נָּה	1	“I can build/have a family through her {children}.” or “she can have children for me so that I can build/have a family.”
16:2	klj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֥ע אַבְרָ֖ם לְ⁠ק֥וֹל שָׂרָֽי	1	“Abram agreed to do what Sarai/she requested/suggested.” or “So Abram listened to Sarai.”
16:3	kkb6			וַ⁠תִּקַּ֞ח שָׂרַ֣י אֵֽשֶׁת אַבְרָ֗ם	1	“So/Then Abram’s wife Sarai took/brought” or “Then Sarai took/brought”. In the Hebrew text, the phrase “Abram’s wife” is repeated (in verses 1 and 3) to emphasize Sarai’s relationship to Abram in contrast to Hagar. For some languages it is overly redundant to repeat that phrase, and so they leave it implied here. However, if possible, it is best to keep this repetition in your translation.
16:3	hq9o			אֶת הָגָ֤ר הַ⁠מִּצְרִית֙ שִׁפְחָתָ֔⁠הּ	1	“her Egyptian servant woman Hagar,” or “her servant Hagar,” The word “Egyptian” is repeated (in verses 1 and 3) to emphasize the fact that Hagar was a foreigner. If possible, it is best to keep this repetition in your translation.
16:3	c5qd			מִ⁠קֵּץ֙ עֶ֣שֶׂר שָׁנִ֔ים לְ⁠שֶׁ֥בֶת אַבְרָ֖ם בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1	“after Abram {and Sarai} had lived in the land/region of Canaan for ten years,”

16:4	z3yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥א אֶל הָגָ֖ר	1	“Then/So Abram slept with Hagar,” or “Then/So Abram/he had {marital} relations with Hagar,” Consider whether it is better in your language to refer to Abram by his name or by a pronoun here at the beginning of this paragraph. See how you translated the idiom “go to” in verse 2.
16:4	zkod		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תַּ֑הַר	1	“and {as a result,}” or “and {so}”
16:4	onr6			וַ⁠תַּ֑הַר	1	“and {as a result,} she became pregnant.” or “and {so} she became pregnant.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase will not be embarrassing or offensive to people, especially when it is read aloud.
16:4	j6gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תֵּ֨רֶא֙ כִּ֣י הָרָ֔תָה	1	“And/But {when} she/Hagar saw/realized that she was pregnant,” The word “saw” is used here as an idiom that means “realized” or “perceived”. Consider whether or not you have a similar idiom in your language that would work well here.
16:4	kp9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תֵּקַ֥ל גְּבִרְתָּ֖⁠הּ בְּ⁠עֵינֶֽי⁠הָ	1	“she despised/disrespected her mistress/owner {Sarai}.” or “she regarded/treated her mistress/owner {Sarai} with contempt/disdain.” or “she started to look down on her mistress {Sarai}.” The phrase “despised in her eyes” is an idiom that refers here to Hagar’s attitude and disrespectful actions toward Sarai. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. Also consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language.
16:5	cvvc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר שָׂרַ֣י אֶל אַבְרָם֮	1	“Then/So Sarai complained to Abram,”
16:5	l7q0			חֲמָסִ֣⁠י עָלֶי⁠ךָ֒	1	“I am suffering because of you!” or “I am being mistreated because of you!” or “It is your fault that I am being treated wrongly/badly!” or “It is your fault that I am suffering!”

Make sure that your translation of this clause is not offensive.
16:5	ouxe			וַ⁠תֵּ֨רֶא֙ כִּ֣י הָרָ֔תָה	1	“but {now that} she knows/realizes that she is pregnant,”
16:5	dadx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וָ⁠אֵקַ֖ל בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	“she despises/disrespects me!” or “she treats me with contempt/disdain”. Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. Also see how you translated a similar clause in verse 4.
16:5	igre		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִשְׁפֹּ֥ט בֵּינִ֥⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֶֽיׄ⁠ךָ	1	“I ask Yahweh to judge/decide between you and me {who is responsible for this}!” or “I ask Yahweh to judge/decide who is right/wrong, you or me!” or “May Yahweh judge whether it is you or I who is responsible {for this}!” As the head of the household, it was Abram’s responsibility to rebuke Hagar and require her to respect Sarai. You could put that information in a footnote.
16:6	mgqu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר אַבְרָ֜ם אֶל שָׂרַ֗י	1	“But Abram said/replied to Sarai/her,” or “Abram said/replied,”

16:6	onw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שִׁפְחָתֵ⁠ךְ֙ בְּ⁠יָדֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	“your slave/servant woman is under your authority/control.” or “you have authority over your slave/servant.” or “you are in charge of your servant.” The phrase “in your hand” is an idiom that refers to having control or authority over someone. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. Also see how you translated “maidservant” in verses 1-3, 5.
16:6	ns17			עֲשִׂי לָ֖⁠הּ	1	“Do with her” or “{So} {you can/may} do to/with her”
16:6	orxc			הַ⁠טּ֣וֹב בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑יִ⁠ךְ	1	“what{ever} you think/decide is good/right/best.” or “what{ever} pleases you.” The phrase “in your eyes” is an idiom that refers to Sarai’s opinion. See how you translated a similar idiom (“in her eyes”) in verses 4 and 5.
16:6	yvhx			וַ⁠תְּעַנֶּ֣⁠הָ שָׂרַ֔י	1	“Then/So Sarai oppressed/mistreated her/Hagar, and/so” or “Then/So Sarai treated her/Hagar so harshly/badly that”. See how you translated “afflict” in Gen 15:13.
16:6	a1qw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תִּבְרַ֖ח מִ⁠פָּנֶֽי⁠הָ	1	“she/Hagar ran away from her.” or “she/Hagar ran away {from home to get away} from her/Sarai.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Hagar is the one who fled, not Sarai.
16:7	ziyg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַֽ⁠יִּמְצָאָ֞⁠הּ מַלְאַ֧ךְ יְהוָ֛ה	1	“Then/But an angel/messenger {sent} from Yahweh found Hagar” or “Then/But one of Yahweh’s angels/messengers came to Hagar”. Make sure that the way you translate “found” does not sound like the angel had come across Hagar accidentally. Rather, he knew where she was and had gone to her intentionally. Also, this messenger from Yahweh was an angel, not a human being.
16:7	urd3			עַל עֵ֥ין הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם	1	“by/beside a spring of water” or “by/beside a spring”
16:7	b4xd			בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּ֑ר	1	“in the desert”. See how you translated “wilderness” in Gen 14:6.
16:7	grd7			עַל הָ⁠עַ֖יִן	1	“{She was} at the spring” or “{It was} the spring”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
16:7	xce6			בְּ⁠דֶ֥רֶךְ שֽׁוּר	1	“{that was} beside/by the road {that goes} to {the city of} Shur.” or “{that was} beside/by the road near {the city of} Shur.”
16:8	aajb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֗ר	1	“And the angel/messenger said {to her},” or “The angel/messenger asked {her},” The angel asked Hagar a question, so for some languages it is better to use a word like “asked” here. Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language.
16:8	sc3u			הָגָ֞ר שִׁפְחַ֥ת שָׂרַ֛י	1	“Hagar, Sarai’s slave/servant,” or “Hagar, who serves Sarai,”
16:8	ogxo			אֵֽי מִ⁠זֶּ֥ה בָ֖את וְ⁠אָ֣נָה תֵלֵ֑כִי	1	“where are you coming from, and where are you headed?”
16:8	yltk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר	1	“She/Hagar said/replied {to him},” or “She/Hagar answered {him},”
16:8	ya1g			מִ⁠פְּנֵי֙ שָׂרַ֣י גְּבִרְתִּ֔⁠י אָנֹכִ֖י בֹּרַֽחַת	1	“I am running away from my mistress/owner Sarai.” See how you translated “fled from … face” in verse 6 and how you translated “mistress” in verse 4.
16:9	symc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר לָ⁠הּ֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֔ה	1	“But/So Yahweh’s angel/messenger told her/Hagar,” or “Then/But he told her/Hagar,” Consider what is the best way to begin this verse in your translation, after what Hagar said in verse 8.
16:9	ceyk			שׁ֖וּבִי אֶל גְּבִרְתֵּ֑⁠ךְ	1	“Go back {home} to your mistress/owner {Sarai}”. See how you translated “mistress/owner” in verses 4 and 8.

16:10	wpc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר לָ⁠הּ֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֔ה	1	“Then the angel/messenger told/promised her,” or “Then he added/continued,” Some languages do not include the quote margins here and in verse 11, because the angel is still talking to Hagar. However, the repeated quote margins could be there to emphasize what the angel says next and/or to show that he paused or that he is changing the topic.
16:10	un14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַרְבָּ֥ה אַרְבֶּ֖ה אֶת זַרְעֵ֑⁠ךְ	1	“I {Yahweh} will greatly increase/multiply {the number of} your offspring/descendants, so that” or “{This is what Yahweh says/promises to you:} “I will give you so many offspring/descendants that” ” or “{Yahweh promises to you that} he will give you many descendants, so that”. The pronoun “I” refers to Yahweh here. So either the angel was representing Yahweh and speaking Yahweh’s words to Hagar or it was Yahweh himself who had taken on the form of an angel.
16:10	py6e			וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִסָּפֵ֖ר	1	“no one will be able to count them all,” or “there will be too many to count,”
16:10	vljc			מֵ⁠רֹֽב	1	“because of their large number.” or “because there will be so many of them.”
16:11	e1h4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר לָ⁠הּ֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֔ה	1	“Then/Finally the angel/messenger {also} said/prophesied to her,” or “Then/Finally he {also} told her,” or “Then the angel/messenger added/continued,”
16:11	c3yg			הִנָּ֥⁠ךְ הָרָ֖ה וְ⁠יֹלַ֣דְתְּ בֵּ֑ן	1	“Look/Listen, {as you know,} {you are} expecting a child/baby. You will bear/have a son, and/then” or “Look/Listen, you are pregnant with a son. After/When he is born,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Hagar already knew that she was pregnant, but did not know she was having a son or what she should name him.
16:11	mecd			וְ⁠קָרָ֤את שְׁמ⁠וֹ֙	1	“give him the name” or “name him”
16:11	tezq			יִשְׁמָעֵ֔אל	1	“Ishmael, {which means “God listens/hears,”}” Some translation teams make the meaning of Ishmael’s name explicit in their translation. Other teams put the meaning of his name in a footnote. See what you did for similar cases in Gen 3:20, 4:1, 16, 25; 6:29, 10:25, 11:9.
16:11	q8bz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּֽי שָׁמַ֥ע יְהוָ֖ה אֶל	1	“because Yahweh heard” or “because Yahweh paid attention to”. If you include the meaning of Ishmael’s name earlier in this verse, make sure it fits with how you translate this clause.
16:11	aus7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָנְיֵֽ⁠ךְ	1	“your {cries of} misery/suffering {and has helped you}.” or “you when you were suffering {and has helped you}.” The word that means “listened to” implies here that God also took action to help Hagar.
16:12	rnzx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֤וּא	1	“{When Ishmael grows up,} he” or “As for Ishmael, {when he grows up,} he”. The pronoun “he” is emphatic here, to emphasize Ishmael. Make sure that your translation refers here to Ishmael, not Yahweh.
16:12	p7hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִהְיֶה֙ פֶּ֣רֶא אָדָ֔ם	1	“will be {proud and free} {like} a wild/untamed donkey” or “will be {like} a wild/untamed donkey {that no one can control/rule}” or “will not be ruled by anyone else”. The angel compares Ishmael to a wild donkey. Consider whether or not your language can use a similar metaphor or a simile here.
16:12	ihvp			יָד֣⁠וֹ בַ⁠כֹּ֔ל וְ⁠יַ֥ד כֹּ֖ל בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“He will fight against everyone, and everyone will fight against him.” or “He will be enemies with everyone.”
16:12	y6tx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠עַל־פְּנֵ֥י & יִשְׁכֹּֽן	1	“In fact, he will {even} be hostile toward” or “Yes/Indeed, he will {also/even} fight against”. The rest of this verse forms a parallelism with the first half, emphasizing what Ishmael (and his descendants) will be like. Try to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation, since each part has a different focus and the second part adds important information. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
16:12	sdus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָל אֶחָ֖י⁠ו	1	“all of his {own} relatives.” or “all of his {own} family members.” The word “brothers” is used here to refer to relatives in general. Consider what is the best way to translate this synecdoche in your language.

Decide what is best in your language.
16:13	nxa3			כִּ֣י אָֽמְרָ֗ה	1	“{She named him that,} because she {had} said/exclaimed {to herself},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your translation.
16:14	jkis			עַל כֵּן֙	1	“That is why”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 11:9.
16:14	x357			קָרָ֣א לַ⁠בְּאֵ֔ר	1	“the/that well is/was called/named” or “people call that well” or “the name of the/that well is”. Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific. Also, this well is the same as the spring in verse 7. For some languages, it may be necessary to translate these words the same way so that it is clear that they refer to the same place. Do what is best in your language.
16:14	hkkl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּאֵ֥ר לַחַ֖י רֹאִ֑י	1	“Beer Lahai Roi, {which means, “Well of the Living One, who sees me.”}”

16:16	xkvq			בְּ⁠לֶֽדֶת הָגָ֥ר אֶת יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל לְ⁠אַבְרָֽם	1	“when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael for him.” or “when Hagar had Ishmael for him.” See how you translated “bore … for Abram” in verse 15. Also, be consistent here with how you spelled “Hagar” in chapter 16 (verses 1, 4, 6-11, 13), and how you spelled “Ishmael” in verses 11, 12 and 15.
17:1	a4g7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י אַבְרָ֔ם בֶּן־תִּשְׁעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה וְ⁠תֵ֣שַׁע שָׁנִ֑ים	1	“{Years} later, when Abram was ninety-nine/99 years old,” Thirteen years have passed between the last verse of chapter 16 and the first verse of chapter 17. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new section. See how you translated “was a son of … years” in Gen 5:32.
17:1	b3u2			וַ⁠יֵּרָ֨א יְהוָ֜ה אֶל אַבְרָ֗ם	1	“Yahweh appeared/came to him” or “Yahweh visited him”. See how you translated this clause in Gen 12:7.
17:1	zcp6			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָי⁠ו֙	1	“and told him,”
17:1	ph7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֲנִי אֵ֣ל שַׁדַּ֔י	1	“I {am} Almighty God.” or “I {am} the all-powerful God.” or “I {am} God {who is} all-powerful.” Most translation teams translate the meaning of God’s title here (“God Almighty”). A few teams transliterate the title as “El Shaddai” (as if it were a personal name) and put the meaning of the title in a footnote. Abram already knew that God’s personal name is Yahweh (Gen 12:8; 15:7-8), so he would have understood that God was using a title here (not a personal name). The title “God Almighty” emphasizes God’s authority and power. You could include a transliteration of this title in a footnote.
17:1	z65o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idioms	הִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ לְ⁠פָנַ֖⁠י	1	“Walk/Live in my presence” or “Live according to my will” or “Live in a way that pleases me”. This phrase is an idiom that means to habitually live according to God’s will.
17:1	mxfa			וֶ⁠הְיֵ֥ה	1	“{yes, you must} be” or “so that you will be”
17:1	bv2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תָמִֽים	1	“without fault.” or “blameless/upright.” See how you translated this idiom in Gen 6:9. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
17:2	dsx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וְ⁠אֶתְּנָ֥ה בְרִיתִ֖⁠י	1	“I will establish/institute my covenant/agreement”. Some translations begin this sentence without a conjunction. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “cut/make/establish … covenant” in Gen 15:18, where the verb is different from here but has a similar meaning (“establish/seal” or “put into effect”).
17:2	ig4c			בֵּינִ֣⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	“with you,”
17:2	unnk			וְ⁠אַרְבֶּ֥ה אוֹתְ⁠ךָ֖ בִּ⁠מְאֹ֥ד מְאֹֽד	1	“and I will cause you to have very many descendants.” or “and I will increase {the number of} your descendants so that they are exceedingly/very numerous.”
17:3	iqyn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּפֹּ֥ל אַבְרָ֖ם עַל־פָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	“Then Abram prostrated himself {before God} {to show him respect},” or “{When} Abram {heard that, he} bowed with his face to the ground {before God} {to show respect},” Make sure that the translation of this clause does not sound like Abram fell down accidentally. Rather, he intentionally threw himself to the ground out of deep respect for God.
17:3	ia2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אִתּ֛⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	“and God spoke with/to him and said,” or “and God continued speaking with/to him/Abram,” or “and God continued/added,” Some translations omit “saying” here because it is not natural in those languages. Do what is best in your language.
17:4	opjt			אֲנִ֕י הִנֵּ֥ה בְרִיתִ֖⁠י אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ וְ⁠הָיִ֕יתָ	1	“Listen/Look, this is my part/responsibility in my covenant/agreement with you: I will cause you to be/become” or “Listen/Look, this is what I will do to fulfill my covenant/agreement with you: I will make you” In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “me” is emphatic both in form and in sentence position to emphasize that Yahweh is the one doing this.
17:4	jhlo			לְ⁠אַ֖ב	1	“the ancestor of”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 4:20, 21; 10:21.
17:4	to54			הֲמ֥וֹן	1	“a large number of” or “many”
17:4	bvqg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	גּוֹיִֽם	1	“people/ethnic groups.” See how you translated this term in Gen 10:5, 20, 31, 32.

17:5	ju00			כִּ֛י & נְתַתִּֽי⁠ךָ	1	“because I will make you” or “because you will be”. The form of the Hebrew verb in this clause is completed aspect (“have made”) and shows certainty that God will do this. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
17:5	gvn8			אַב הֲמ֥וֹן גּוֹיִ֖ם	1	“the ancestor of many people/ethnic groups.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 4.
17:6	d68r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠הִפְרֵתִ֤י אֹֽתְ⁠ךָ֙ בִּ⁠מְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֔ד	1	“Yes, I will make you extremely/exceedingly fruitful,” or “I will give you very many offspring/descendants,” This verse repeats and elaborates on the last part of verse 5; it does not refer to different events. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language.
17:6	p8wc			וּ⁠נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ לְ⁠גוֹיִ֑ם	1	“so that you will be/become {the father/ancestor of} {many} people/ethnic groups,” or “and I will cause your descendants to become {many} people/ethnic groups,”
17:6	vqo1			וּ⁠מְלָכִ֖ים מִמְּ⁠ךָ֥ יֵצֵֽאוּ	1	“In fact, there will be kings who descend from you.” or “In fact, some of your descendants will be/become kings.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “king” in Gen 14:1-5.

See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2. The pronouns “you” and “your” are singular in this clause and also later in this verse.
17:7	dj4k			וּ⁠בֵ֨ין זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֧ אַחֲרֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1	“and {all} your offspring/descendants {who live/come} after you” or “as well as {all} your offspring/descendants”
17:7	s1qx			לְ⁠דֹרֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	“for {all} generations to come” or “for {all} future generations”
17:7	cyi2			לִ⁠בְרִ֣ית עוֹלָ֑ם	1	“It will be a covenant/agreement that never ends,” or “It will be a covenant/agreement that lasts forever,” For some languages it is better to break up this long sentence and begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
17:7	ds2h			לִ⁠הְי֤וֹת לְ⁠ךָ֙ לֵֽ⁠אלֹהִ֔ים וּֽ⁠לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ אַחֲרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	“that I will be your God and {the God} of {all} your descendants.” or “that I will be the God who takes care of you and {all} your descendants.” or “that I will be the God whom you and {all} your descendants worship/serve.”
17:8	nyz3			וְ⁠נָתַתִּ֣י לְ֠⁠ךָ וּ⁠לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֨ אַחֲרֶ֜י⁠ךָ	1	“I will also give to you and your offspring/descendants”

17:8	bvrb			לַ⁠אֲחֻזַּ֖ת עוֹלָ֑ם	1	“It will be their land/property forever,” or “They will own it forever,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
17:8	udkv			וְ⁠הָיִ֥יתִי לָ⁠הֶ֖ם לֵ⁠אלֹהִֽים	1	“and I will be their God.” or “and I will be the God who takes care of them.” or “I will be the God whom they worship/serve.” See how you translated the phrase “be God to you” in verse 7.
17:9	qzbp			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	“Then God continued,” Some languages leave out this quote margin, because God is still speaking to the same person. See what you did for similar cases in Gen 16:10-11.
17:9	ognl			וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה	1	“As for you,” or “Now as for your part/responsibility {in this/my covenant/agreement},” or “Your part/responsibility {in this/my covenant/agreement} is that”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “you” is emphatic both in form and in sentence position to shift the focus from talking about God’s part in the covenant (verses 4-8) to talking about Abraham’s part. Translate this phrase in a way that shows this change in focus.
17:9	zstx			אֶת בְּרִיתִ֣⁠י תִשְׁמֹ֑ר	1	“you must keep/obey {the requirements/rules of} my covenant/agreement,” or “you must obey me,”
17:9	r3ok			אַתָּ֛ה וְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֥	1	“{both/including} you and” or “{That includes} you and” or “{That applies to} you as well as”. For some languages it is better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

17:9	uumy			לְ⁠דֹרֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	“for/including {all} generations to come.” or “for/including {all} future generations.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 7, and a similar phrase in verse 8.
17:10	grqg			זֹ֣את בְּרִיתִ֞⁠י	1	“This is {what I require in} my covenant/agreement” or “This is {one of the requirements of/in} my covenant/agreement”
17:10	mdxu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּשְׁמְר֗וּ	1	“which you {all} must obey,” Notice that the pronoun “you” is plural here.
17:10	esro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בֵּינִ⁠י֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ינֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וּ⁠בֵ֥ין	1	“{the covenant/agreement that is} between me and you {all}, including” or “{the covenant/agreement I have made} with {all of} you, including”. The pronoun “you” is plural here and probably refers to Abraham and his family or household.
17:10	bxe0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ אַחֲרֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	“your descendants {who will live} after you:” or “{all} your descendants:” Notice that the pronouns “your” and “you” are singular here and refer to Abraham. Also, it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of some of the clauses in this sentence and say, “This is {what I require in} my covenant/agreement with you and your descendants {who will live after you}, which you {all} must keep/obey:” Do what is best in your language.
17:10	pe10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	הִמּ֥וֹל לָ⁠כֶ֖ם כָּל זָכָֽר	1	“You must circumcise all males {who live} among/with you.” or “You must cut off the {male} foreskin of every boy and man {who lives} among you.” Circumcision involves cutting the foreskin off the penis of a boy or man. Translate this clause in a way that does not offend or embarrass people. Some languages may need to be more discreet and say something general like “must cut off the {male} skin” or “must follow the {male} skin-cutting custom.” It may be necessary to include a footnote and/or an explanation in the glossary about this so that people understand what circumcision is, especially in areas where people cut their skin on other parts of the body for other reasons.
17:11	mhww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וּ⁠נְמַלְתֶּ֕ם אֵ֖ת בְּשַׂ֣ר עָרְלַתְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“Yes, {all the males among} you must have your/their foreskins cut off,” or “Indeed/Yes, you must circumcise the foreskin of {all the males among} you”. Notice that in the Hebrew text, the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural in this verse. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “circumcise” in verse 10.
17:11	c80d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠הָיָה֙ לְ⁠א֣וֹת בְּרִ֔ית בֵּינִ֖⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	“and that {custom/practice} will serve as the sign {that reminds you} of this/my covenant/agreement {I made} with {all of} you.” or “and that {custom/practice} will remind/show {you all} that {I made} this/my covenant/agreement with you.” The pronoun “you” is plural here.
17:12	pl8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בֶן שְׁמֹנַ֣ת יָמִ֗ים יִמּ֥וֹל	1	“{Every} eight-day-old baby boy must be circumcised {by you},” or “So you must circumcise {every} eight-day-old baby boy,” Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language.
17:12	c7zl			כָּל זָכָ֖ר	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “{and} every {other} male” or “{as well as} all {other} males” or (2) “{yes,} every male {child}”. The following context suggests that this phrase includes males of all ages, not just babies, since male slaves who were bought would especially include adult males.
17:12	rvqc			לָ⁠כֶ֛ם	1	“among your people”
17:12	n2rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לְ⁠דֹרֹתֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“for all {future} generations,” It may be more natural to put this phrase at the beginning of this verse and say, “For all {future} generations you must circumcise {every} baby boy who is eight days old, {as well as} all {other} males among your people …” Do what is best in your language.
17:12	qqux			יְלִ֣יד בָּ֔יִת	1	“{including} those/males {who are} born in your household/family” or “{That includes} those/males from your own household/family”. This phrase refers to Abraham’s future sons, including Isaac (Gen 21:4) and his concubines’ sons (25:6), and may also refer to the sons of Abraham’s servants. Also, for some languages it may be better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

17:13	bi24			הִמּ֧וֹל יִמּ֛וֹל	1	“{That’s right,} they must definitely be circumcised,” or “{Yes,} you must surely/definitely circumcise {all of} them,” This verse repeats and emphasizes what was just said in verse 12. Consider what is the best way to communicate this emphasis in your language.
17:13	zibc			יְלִ֥יד בֵּֽיתְ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠מִקְנַ֣ת כַּסְפֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	“{including} those/males who are born in your household as well as those/males whom you buy {as a slave/servant}.” or “{regardless of whether} they are sons/males from your own household/family or slaves/servants whom you have bought.” See how you translated these phrases in verse 12. It may be best to translate them in a slightly different way here because of the repetition. Do what is best in your language.
17:13	ojc7			וְ⁠הָיְתָ֧ה בְרִיתִ֛⁠י	1	“That is how {the sign of} my covenant/agreement will/must be marked” or “That is how you must mark my covenant/agreement”
17:13	yepf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בִּ⁠בְשַׂרְ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	“on your bodies”. The word “flesh” refers here to the body in general. Translate this in a way that is clear and natural in your language.
17:13	we4s			לִ⁠בְרִ֥ית עוֹלָֽם	1	“to show that it is an everlasting/permanent covenant/agreement.” or “to show that it is a covenant/agreement that never ends.” See how you translated “an eternal covenant” in verse 7.
17:14	sp1v			וְ⁠עָרֵ֣ל זָכָ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹֽא יִמּוֹל֙ אֶת בְּשַׂ֣ר עָרְלָת֔⁠וֹ	1	“But {as for} any/every male/man who is not circumcised,” or “In fact, if a/any man refuses to let you circumcise him,” or “If a/any man refuses to be circumcised,” In this context, “male” refers to men who refuse to be circumcised, not baby boys.

The phrase “cut off from his people” is an idiom which means that the person is an outcast of society and can no longer associate closely with other people in that society. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that would work well here.
17:14	x4d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הֵפַֽר	1	“{because} he has not kept/obeyed” or “{because} he has disobeyed”. This phrase has the opposite meaning of “keep” or “obey” in verse 9. Consider whether or not your language has an idiom like “broken” that means to not do what has been agreed upon or to disobey what was commanded.
17:14	r1ku			אֶת בְּרִיתִ֖⁠י	1	“{the requirements/rules of} my covenant/agreement.” or “{what I require in} my covenant/agreement.”
17:15	b4k2			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	“Later God {also} said to Abraham,” or “God {also} told Abraham,”
17:15	d7gc			שָׂרַ֣י אִשְׁתְּ⁠ךָ֔	1	“{As for} your wife Sarai,” This phrase is first in this quote to change the focus to Sarai and emphasize her. Consider what is the best way to do this in your language.
17:15	zovk			לֹא תִקְרָ֥א אֶת שְׁמָ֖⁠הּ שָׂרָ֑י	1	“do not call her Sarai {anymore},” or “her name will no longer be Sarai,”

Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that fits well here.
17:17	d074		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠לְּ⁠בֶ֤ן מֵאָֽה שָׁנָה֙ יִוָּלֵ֔ד	1	“How can a hundred-year-old man {like me/myself} father a son/child?” or “Certainly it is not possible for a hundred-year-old man {like me} to father a son/child!” or “Certainly a hundred-year-old man {like myself} cannot father a son/child, can he?” Abraham uses the rhetorical questions in verse 17 to express strong disbelief. If that is not clear in your language, you could translate the rhetorical questions as statements, with or without a tag question.
17:17	ld4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אִ֨ם שָׂרָ֔ה הֲ⁠בַת תִּשְׁעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה תֵּלֵֽד	1	“And how can Sarah who is 90 years old {still} have a baby/child?” or “And certainly it is not possible for a 90-year-old woman like Sarah to {still} bear/have a baby/child!” or “And certainly a 90-year-old woman like Sarah cannot {still} give birth to a baby/child, can she?”

17:19	e0ka			אֲבָל֙	1	“No, rather” or “Yes, but/however”. Consider whether it is best in your language to begin God’s response to Abraham here with a “No” or a “Yes”. Although God agrees that he will bless Ishmael (verse 20), he disagrees with Abraham’s request to allow Ishmael to be the one God establishes his covenant with.
17:19	vvis			שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתְּ⁠ךָ֗	1	“{as I said,} your wife Sarah {is the one} {who}” or “{it is} your wife Sarah {who}”. Here God emphasizes what he said in verse 16 about Sarah.

17:20	ya9m			שְׁנֵים עָשָׂ֤ר נְשִׂיאִם֙	1	“twelve {sons who become} chiefs,” or “twelve {sons who will be} {great/powerful} leaders,” Many translations have “princes” here, but these Ishmaelite rulers were not actually sons of a king, so it is better to use a more general term in your translation.
17:20	tlf0			וּ⁠נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ו לְ⁠ג֥וֹי גָּדֽוֹל	1	“and I will make him {the father/ancestor of} a great/large people/ethnic group.” or “and I will make him {and his descendants} become a great/large people/ethnic group.”
17:21	ni6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וְ⁠אֶת בְּרִיתִ֖⁠י אָקִ֣ים	1	“But I will establish/make my covenant/agreement”. In the Hebrew text, the phrase “my covenant” is put before the verb in order to change the topic to God’s covenant. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Also consider again how you translated “covenant” in verses 2, 4, 7, 9-11, 13-14, 19, 21.
17:21	ata9			אֶת יִצְחָ֑ק	1	“with {your son} Isaac,”
17:21	nbs6			אֲשֶׁר֩ תֵּלֵ֨ד לְ⁠ךָ֤ שָׂרָה֙	1	“whom Sarah will give birth to for you” or “Sarah will give birth to him”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated “is bearing … for you” in verse 19.
17:21	e5iw			לַ⁠מּוֹעֵ֣ד הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה בַּ⁠שָּׁנָ֖ה הָ⁠אַחֶֽרֶת	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “by/at this time/season next year.” or (2) “at the appointed/set time next year.”
17:22	e61u			וַ⁠יְכַ֖ל לְ⁠דַבֵּ֣ר אִתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“When/After he/God had finished speaking/talking with/to Abraham,” See how you translated “spoke with him” in verse 3.

Do what is clear and natural in your language.

17:24	q91v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠אַ֨בְרָהָ֔ם	1	“Now Abraham” or “Abraham”. The information in verses 24 and 25 is background information.

17:24	cjb4			בֶּן תִּשְׁעִ֥ים וָ⁠תֵ֖שַׁע שָׁנָ֑ה	1	“was ninety-nine/99 years old”. See how you translated “a son of … years” in verse 1.

Some Jewish scholars think it was Shem and some others think Abraham did it himself. However, the Hebrew text does not say who did it, so in your translation it is best to also not specify who did it. Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language.
17:25	vbof			וְ⁠יִשְׁמָעֵ֣אל בְּנ֔⁠וֹ	1	“and his son Ishmael” or “His son Ishmael”. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.

17:26	d2d2			בְּ⁠עֶ֨צֶם֙ הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה	1	“{So it was,} on that very/same day”. Verses 26 and 27 repeat what happened in verse 23 to emphasize what happened. Make sure in your translation that it does not sound like Abraham and Ishmael were circumcised twice. See how you translated “on that very/same day” in verse 23.
17:26	ipkz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִמּ֖וֹל אַבְרָהָ֑ם וְ⁠יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל בְּנֽ⁠וֹ	1	“{both} Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised.” or “Abraham was circumcised, and {he circumcised} his son Ishmael.” Abraham is the one who circumcised his son Ishmael (verse 23). See how you translated “he was circumcised” in verse 24.
17:27	mh99			וְ⁠כָל אַנְשֵׁ֤י	1	“And all the {other} males in/from his/Abraham’s household,” or “All the males in/from his/Abraham’s household,”

Also, consider again how you translated “circumcised” in verses 10-14, 23-27.
18:1	xaic			וַ⁠יֵּרָ֤א אֵלָי⁠ו֙ יְהוָ֔ה	1	“Then {one day} Yahweh appeared/came {again} to him/Abraham” or “One day Yahweh visited Abraham {again}”. See how you translated “appeared” in Gen 12:7 and 17:1. Also, consider whether it is better to refer to Abraham here with a pronoun or with his name in your language.
18:1	yyba			בְּ⁠אֵלֹנֵ֖י מַמְרֵ֑א	1	“at/near Mamre’s terebinth/oak trees,” or “beside the terebinth/oak trees on Mamre’s land,” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 13:18, 14:13, and a similar phrase in Gen 12:6.
18:1	qyjw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֛וּא יֹשֵׁ֥ב	1	“while/as Abraham was sitting”
18:1	grq0			פֶּֽתַח הָ⁠אֹ֖הֶל	1	“{at/in} the entrance/doorway of his tent” or “{by} the front of his tent”. The entrance to the tent was an opening that could be closed by a large piece of cloth or animal skin. It did not have a solid wood door like a house has. See how you translated “tent” in Gen 4:20.
18:1	x2ic			כְּ⁠חֹ֥ם הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	“during the hot/hottest time/part of the day.”
18:2	febu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֤א עֵינָי⁠ו֙ וַ⁠יַּ֔רְא	1	“He/Abraham looked up/around”. See how you translate this phrase in Gen 22:13.
18:2	lfa5			וְ⁠הִנֵּה֙ שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה אֲנָשִׁ֔ים נִצָּבִ֖ים	1	“and saw/noticed that there were three men standing” or “and was surprised to see three men standing”
18:2	ceux			עָלָ֑י⁠ו	1	“a short distance away.” or “not too far away from him.” Translate this phrase in a way that fits with the fact that the men were far enough away from Abraham that he could run over to them (as he did in the next sentence).
18:2	waan			וַ⁠יַּ֗רְא	1	“When he saw {them},” or “As soon as he saw {them},”
18:2	vco6			וַ⁠יָּ֤רָץ & מִ⁠פֶּ֣תַח הָ⁠אֹ֔הֶל	1	“he got/jumped up from where he was and ran/hurried” or “he {jumped/got up and} ran/hurried {to them}”

18:3	unrc			וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	“and said {to them},”
18:3	i1yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics	אֲדֹנָ֗⁠י	1	“My masters,” or “Sirs/Gentlemen,” Abraham uses “lords” here as a polite address to the three men. The Hebrew word “lord” can also be a reference to God, but notice that at this point Abraham probably thought he was talking to men or angels. It wasn’t until later that he realized that one of them was Yahweh (verse 14).
18:3	f44a			אִם נָ֨א מָצָ֤אתִי חֵן֙ בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“if you are pleased/satisfied with me,” or “if you consider me worthy {to be your host},” or “if you would favor/honor me {with your presence},” The pronoun “your” is singular here in the Hebrew text, and also in the next clause. It could be that Abraham is addressing each of the three men simultaneously, or that he is addressing their leader or spokesman.
18:3	qzez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אַל נָ֥א תַעֲבֹ֖ר מֵ⁠עַ֥ל עַבְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	“please do not leave here without letting me serve you {as my guests}.” or “please stay here for a while as my guests.” Abraham refers to himself as a servant here in order to show respect to his guests.
18:4	s8jr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יֻקַּֽח נָ֣א מְעַט מַ֔יִם	1	“Please let me bring {you} some water,” or “Let my servants bring {you} some water,” Saying “a little” was a polite way of showing generosity. Make sure your translation does not sound here like Abraham was only offering the men a tiny bit of water; he or his servants were going to bring them enough water to wash their feet.
18:4	ygvl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠רַחֲצ֖וּ רַגְלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“That way you {all} can wash {the dust off} your feet”. People wore sandals and their feet would get dusty when they traveled. So it was customary to offer guests water to wash the dust off their feet. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. Also, notice that the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural here in the Hebrew text.
18:4	pywd			וְ⁠הִֽשָּׁעֲנ֖וּ	1	“and then rest/relax {here}”
18:4	cf27			תַּ֥חַת הָ⁠עֵֽץ	1	“under {the shade of} this tree.”
18:5	dabs			וְ⁠אֶקְחָ֨ה	1	“I will also bring/get {you}” or “Let me also bring/get {you}”
18:5	w6hc			פַת	1	“a little bit of” or “some”. Saying “a morsel” was a polite way of showing generosity. Make sure your translation does not sound here like Abraham was only offering the men a tiny bit of bread; he was going to give them plenty of food to eat.
18:5	qih5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֶ֜חֶם	1	“bread/food {for you} {to eat}.” Since bread was a common staple of their diet, it is often used in the Bible to refer to food in general.
18:5	e1nm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠סַעֲד֤וּ לִבְּ⁠כֶם֙	1	“Then you can be refreshed/strengthened” or “That way you can regain your strength”. Notice that the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural in this quote in the Hebrew text and refer to Abraham’s three guests.
18:5	vde1			אַחַ֣ר תַּעֲבֹ֔רוּ	1	“and then continue on your way,” or “before you continue traveling,”
18:5	gvtq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי־עַל־כֵּ֥ן עֲבַרְתֶּ֖ם עַֽל עַבְדְּ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“now that you have come to me.” or “since you are here with me.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause at the beginning of this verse and say, “Since you are here with me, let me {also} bring some food …” Do what is best in your language.
18:5	hxgd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ	1	“Then/So they said {to him},” or “The men replied {to him},”
18:5	wdtf			כֵּ֥ן	2	“Okay,” or “Very well,” or “That is good/fine,” The word used here in the Hebrew text shows agreement or acceptance. Do what is natural in your language.
18:5	zxbs			תַּעֲשֶׂ֖ה כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּֽרְתָּ	1	“do what you have proposed/suggested.”

18:6	i8g7			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“and said {to her},” or “and told her,”
18:6	eknx			מַהֲרִ֞י	1	“Quickly {get/use}” or “Quickly {prepare}”
18:6	vfdt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שְׁלֹ֤שׁ סְאִים֙	1	“three {large} measures/scoops/batches”. It is not certain how much “three seahs” was, but it is thought that it was more than 20 quarts/liters. It was enough flour to make bread for many people, just as the calf (verse 7) provided enough meat for many people and showed generous hospitality. Besides Abraham’s guests, others in his household may have also joined in eating the feast.
18:6	yzn0			קֶ֣מַח סֹ֔לֶת	1	“of {good/high} quality flour.” or “of the/our best flour.”
18:6	ygf6			ל֖וּשִׁי וַ⁠עֲשִׂ֥י עֻגֽוֹת	1	“Knead {the dough} and make it into loaves/bread.” or “and bake {some} loaves of {flat} bread.” or “and bake/make {some} bread.” The Hebrew word for “loaves” here is often translated “cakes”, which probably refers to their flat, round shape (similar to biscuits). However, make sure your translation of this word does not sound like a dessert, because this bread was not sweet. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
18:7	bsyq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וְ⁠אֶל־הַ⁠בָּקָ֖ר רָ֣ץ אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	“Then Abraham/he hurriedly {left the tent and} went to his herd {of cattle}” or “Next Abraham/he quickly went/hurried {outside} to his herd {of cattle}” or “Then he ran {outside} to his herd {of cattle}”
18:7	hxpb			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֨ח	1	“and chose” or “and picked out”
18:7	z2ik			בֶּן בָּקָ֜ר רַ֤ךְ וָ⁠טוֹב֙	1	“one of his best/choice calves that would be good/tasty to eat.”
18:7	jtgs			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֣ן	1	“Then he took/brought the calf” or “Then he turned it over”. The word “gave” means Abram brought the calf to his servant and put him in charge of preparing its meat for a meal. Make sure your translation does not sound like the calf was a gift.
18:7	zqcc			אֶל הַ⁠נַּ֔עַר	1	“to one of his servants”
18:7	vnc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְמַהֵ֖ר לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת אֹתֽ⁠וֹ	1	“and the/his servant quickly prepared it.” or “who quickly slaughtered/butchered it and cooked/roasted it.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that this clause refers to the servant, not Abraham.
18:8	pb0g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֨ח	1	“Then he/Abraham brought/got”. Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Abraham, not his servant.
18:8	meiu			חֶמְאָ֜ה	1	“{some} curds/yogurt/cheese”. This term refers to churned, fermented milk that has curdled.
18:8	dhgo			וְ⁠חָלָ֗ב	1	“along with milk” or “as well as milk”
18:8	iwky			וּ⁠בֶן הַ⁠בָּקָר֙	1	“and {the meat from} the calf” or “and the meat”

18:8	tlvu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֖ן לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	“and he served {all of} it/that to the {three} men {to eat}.” or “and he set/put it {all} before his {three} guests {to eat}.” Since verse 2 was the last time the three men were mentioned, it may be clearer and more natural to make them explicit here. Do what is best in your language.
18:8	a2nj			וְ⁠הֽוּא עֹמֵ֧ד עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֛ם	1	“Then he stood nearby them” or “Then he stood near/nearby”
18:8	i0dm			תַּ֥חַת הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	“{where they were sitting} under the tree”
18:8	oc6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאכֵֽלוּ	1	“{and waited on them} while they ate.” or “{and served them} while they ate.” As the host, Abraham stood nearby his guests in order to wait on them and make sure they had everything that they needed.
18:9	xl7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵׄלָׄ֔יׄ⁠וׄ	1	“Then {one of} the men asked him/Abraham,” The Hebrew text uses a plural pronoun here (“they”) to refer to one of the three men who spoke to Abraham on behalf of them all (See verse 10). Many languages can use “they” or “the men” in the same way. Make sure your translation of this quote margin does not sound like all three of the men spoke at the same time.
18:9	n7q4			אַיֵּ֖ה שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	“Where {is} your wife Sarah?”
18:9	frnv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	“He/Abraham answered {them/him},” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Abraham is the one speaking here.
18:9	c5q0			הִנֵּ֥ה בָ⁠אֹֽהֶל	1	“{She is} there in/inside the tent.”
18:10	b369			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“Then the/that man”. This phrase refers to the man in verse 9 who spoke on behalf of himself and the other two men. We find out in verse 13 that the man was actually Yahweh. However, at this point Abraham and Sarah probably did not yet know who he was, so it is better to not specify who he was here, in order to keep that suspense in your translation.
18:10	qpv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“said/responded {to him/Abraham},” or “spoke again {to Abraham},”
18:10	aib9			שׁ֣וֹב אָשׁ֤וּב	1	“I will certainly/definitely come back”
18:10	bdy4			אֵלֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	“to you {here}” or “{here} to visit you”
18:10	s103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּ⁠עֵ֣ת חַיָּ֔ה	1	“at/about this time/season next year,” or “next year at/around this time/season,” For some languages it may be more natural to move this time phrase to the beginning of this quote and say, “Next year at this time I will surely/definitely return …” Do what is best in your language.
18:10	usku			וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	“and when I do,” or “When I do,” or “At that time,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
18:10	yh3k			בֵ֖ן לְ⁠שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	“your wife Sarah will have a {baby} son/boy {with her}.” or “your wife Sarah will {already} have a {baby} son/boy.” This means that Sarah would have a son with her when Yahweh returns. It does not mean that she would give birth at that time.
18:10	kp1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠שָׂרָ֥ה שֹׁמַ֛עַת	1	“Now Sarah was listening/eavesdropping” or “Sarah was listening/eavesdropping”. This sentence gives information about something that was happening while the man was talking. Translate this in a way that makes that clear in your language.
18:10	btll			פֶּ֥תַח הָ⁠אֹ֖הֶל	1	“inside the entrance/doorway of the tent,” See how you translated “the entrance of the tent” in verse 1.
18:10	vtqh			וְ⁠ה֥וּא אַחֲרָֽי⁠ו	1	“which was {right} behind”. Notice that the pronoun “it” refers to the entrance to the tent (where Sarah was).
18:10	g6tq			אַחֲרָֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun “him” is ambiguous here. It can refer to: (1) “the man” or (2) “Abraham”
18:11	oz4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֤ם וְ⁠שָׂרָה֙	1	“Abraham and Sarah/she” or “Sarah/She and Abraham”. This verse gives background information that is important to what happens next. Some languages use a conjunction such as “Now” here to introduce this kind of information, while other languages omit the conjunction, especially if “Now” is used to begin the last sentence in verse 10. Do what is best in your language.
18:11	rsbl			זְקֵנִ֔ים בָּאִ֖ים בַּ⁠יָּמִ֑ים	1	“were {already} very/quite old/aged” or “{were} very elderly”
18:11	pdfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	חָדַל֙ לִ⁠הְי֣וֹת לְ⁠שָׂרָ֔ה אֹ֖רַח כַּ⁠נָּשִֽׁים	1	“so that Sarah/she was much older than the normal age for bearing children.” or “so that Sarah/she was {far} past the age/time that she could bear/have children.” The Hebrew text has an idiom here that is a polite way of saying that Sarah had reached menopause and so was not able to have children. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Make sure your translation of this clause will not offend or embarrass people when it is read aloud in public.
18:12	plyn			וַ⁠תִּצְחַ֥ק שָׂרָ֖ה בְּ⁠קִרְבָּ֣⁠הּ	1	“So Sarah/she laughed to herself {in disbelief}”. See how you translated “laughed” in Gen 17:17 where Abraham also laughed to himself.

18:32	lk3d			אַל נָ֞א יִ֤חַר לַֽ⁠אדֹנָ⁠י֙	1	“My Lord/Master, please do not be angry {with/at me},” See how you translated this sentence in verse 30. Consider again how you translated “my Lord” in verses 27, 30-32. Contrast that to verse 3, where Abraham probably used the term before he realized that he was talking to Yahweh.
18:32	kpb0			וַ⁠אֲדַבְּרָ֣ה אַךְ הַ⁠פַּ֔עַם	1	“rather, let me say one more thing:” or “and/but let me ask {you} just one more/last thing/question:”

Also see how you translated “my lord” in Gen 18:3. At this point, Lot probably did not know that these were angels, because they looked like men.
19:2	uv8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	ס֣וּרוּ נָ֠א אֶל	1	“Please come to” or “Please stop in at”. Lot is being urgent here (using “please” twice), probably because he knows how dangerous the city is. Translate this quote in a way that communicates this urgency.
19:2	ya0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בֵּ֨ית עַבְדְּ⁠כֶ֤ם וְ⁠לִ֨ינוּ֙	1	“my house so that I can serve you”. Lot refers to himself as “your servant” here to show respect to the two men and to politely offer to host them as his guests.
19:2	n4bd			וְ⁠לִ֨ינוּ֙ וְ⁠רַחֲצ֣וּ רַגְלֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	“and you can lodge for the night {there}. {That way} too {you can} wash {the dust off} your feet.” or “You can wash {the dust off} your feet and lodge/stay for the night {there}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “wash your feet” in Gen 18:4.
19:2	jib0			וְ⁠הִשְׁכַּמְתֶּ֖ם	1	“Then {tomorrow morning} you can get up early” or “Then early {in the morning} you can get up”

19:2	bnmm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	לֹּ֔א כִּ֥י	1	“No, {thank you,} rather” or “Thank you, but” or “That is kind of you, but”. The angels’ reply should sound polite and respectful in your translation, not rude or disrespectful. For example, in some cultures it is not polite to say “No” too directly.
19:2	nmtj			בָ⁠רְח֖וֹב נָלִֽין	1	“we will {just} stay/sleep in the public/city square tonight.” or “we plan to spend/stay the night in the street/square.” This refers to a public, outdoor place inside the city, perhaps the open place inside the city gate where people would meet.
19:3	ck6p			וַ⁠יִּפְצַר בָּ֣⁠ם מְאֹ֔ד	1	“But he/Lot insisted urgently” or “However he/Lot continued to urge/invite them earnestly” or “However he/Lot continued to urgently invite them”

19:3	yh3g			וַ⁠יַּ֤עַשׂ לָ⁠הֶם֙ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה	1	“Then/There he/Lot prepared/made a big/hearty meal for them,” or “Then/There Lot had a big/hearty meal prepared for them,” Lot probably had his wife or servants prepare the meal (as Abraham did in Gen 18:6-7). It is common in the Bible to say that a leader or head of household (as here) did something, when in reality he had it done by someone else who was under his authority.
19:3	pv7b			וּ⁠מַצּ֥וֹת אָפָ֖ה	1	“including {some} bread without yeast/leavening {in it},” or “including {some} flat bread,”

Consider what is the best way to translate this phrase in your language.
19:4	pth7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל הָ⁠עָ֖ם מִ⁠קָּצֶֽה	1	“{In fact,} all the people from every section/part {of the city} {were there}.” or “{so that} people from the entire city {were there}.” or “{In fact,} everyone/people from all parts of the city {had come there}.” This phrase is hyperbole or exaggeration, to emphasize that a very large number of people from the city were there. Consider whether or not your language can do the same thing. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
19:5	yafr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּקְרְא֤וּ	1	“Then the crowd/mob {of men/people} called out to Lot/him,” or “Then the crowd/mob {of men/people} shouted to Lot/him,” Consider what is the best way to refer to these people at this point in the paragraph in your translation.

19:5	o8pw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠נֵדְעָ֖ה אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	“so that we can have relations/sex with them!” In Hebrew the verb “know” is often used as an idiom that means “have sex with” (as in Gen 4:1, 25). Here it refers to homosexual activities and raping the two men. Translate this in a way that is not too offensive to be read aloud in public.
19:6	t2yg			וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֧א אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֛ם ל֖וֹט הַ⁠פֶּ֑תְחָ⁠ה	1	“But Lot went outside near the entrance/doorway {to talk} to them,”

19:7	sw0r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	“Then he said {to them},” or “and/Then he pleaded {with them},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
19:7	fcre		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	נָ֥א אַחַ֖⁠י	1	“{No,} please, my brothers/friends,” or “I beg you, my brothers/friends,” or “{No,} my brothers/friends, please”. The phrase “my brothers” is used here as a polite address that implies a close relationship. Lot uses this idiom to try to get the men of Sodom to not harm his guests. The men were not his actual brothers. For some languages it is more natural to put “my brothers” (or “my friends”) first in this quote. Do what is best in your language.
19:7	ie42			אַל & תָּרֵֽעוּ	1	“do not do this evil!” or “do not do such an evil/wicked thing!”
19:8	r4h6			הִנֵּה נָ֨א	1	“Listen {to me/this} please:” or “Please listen {to me/this}:” See how you translated this phrase in verse 2.

19:9	v2qe			הָ⁠אֶחָ֤ד בָּֽא	1	“This guy came {here}”. The phrase “this one/guy” shows disdain and disrespect for Lot. If possible, use a similar term in your language here.
19:9	tah3			לָ⁠גוּר֙	1	“to live temporarily,” or “as a foreigner/outsider,” See how you translated “sojourn” in Gen 12:10. Here it has the negative meaning that Lot does not belong there.
19:9	pdcc			וַ⁠יִּשְׁפֹּ֣ט שָׁפ֔וֹט עַתָּ֕ה	1	“and now he wants/dares to judge/condemn {us}!” or “and now he thinks that he can judge {us}!”

Decide whether or not that needs to be explicit in your translation.

19:12	hx9v			בָּ⁠עִ֑יר	1	“in this city,” or “in Sodom?” or “here,” The punctuation you use here depends on whether or not you began a new sentence earlier in this quote.
19:12	l25l			הוֹצֵ֖א	1	“{then} {quickly} take/get {them} out/away”. Whether or not you begin a new sentence here will depend on whether you began a new sentence earlier in this quote.
19:12	h0sr			מִן הַ⁠מָּקֽוֹם	1	“from this city,” or “from here,” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase fits well with the ways that you refer to the city of Sodom earlier in this verse and in the next verse. It may help to read the entire verse aloud to make sure everything is clear and sounds natural in your language.
19:13	gxxj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	כִּֽי מַשְׁחִתִ֣ים אֲנַ֔חְנוּ	1	“because we are about/going to destroy”. The pronoun “we” refers here only to the two angels, not Lot or anyone else.

See how you translated “outcry” in Gen 18:20-21. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Also, make sure that your translation of “their outcry” refers to the people of Sodom, not Lot’s relatives who were the last ones referred to (verse 12).

19:14	i021			וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	“and he said {to them},” or “and he warned/urged {them},” or “He told them,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

19:16	f2ww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠חֶמְלַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה עָלָ֑י⁠ו	1	“because Yahweh was being merciful/kind to him/them,” For some languages it may be better to put this phrase last in verse 16 so that it does not interrupt the flow of the sentence. Or it may be better to put this phrase earlier in the sentence and say, “Lot hesitated, but Yahweh was being merciful/kind to him, so the {two} men/angels took hold of Lot’s hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and took/led them out of the city.” Do what is best in your language.

19:17	fqrc			הָ⁠הָ֥רָ⁠ה	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “to the mountains/hills” or “to the hill country” or “to the/that mountain {range}” or (2) “to the/that mountain”. This phrase is ambiguous because often the Hebrew text uses a singular form to refer to something that is plural.

19:19	brtm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מָצָ֨א עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֣ חֵן֮ בְּ⁠עֵינֶי⁠ךָ֒	1	“{I,} your servant, have been treated well/kindly by you,” or “You have treated me well/kindly even though I am unimportant,” The phrase “your servant” does not mean that Lot is actually a servant for the angels, but rather, it is a humble way for Lot to refer to himself and show respect to them. See how you translated that phrase in verse 2. Also see how you translated the idiom “found favor in … eyes” in Gen 6:8 and 18:3.
19:19	u1nu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠תַּגְדֵּ֣ל חַסְדְּ⁠ךָ֗ אֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשִׂ֨יתָ֙ עִמָּדִ֔⁠י	1	“and you have shown me great mercy/kindness” or “and you have been very merciful/kind to me”. This is the first occurrence in the Bible of the important Hebrew word “khesed,” which is translated as “mercy,” “kindness,” or “lovingkindness” and often implies that it was not deserved. Compare how you translated a different word that has a similar meaning (“mercy” or “compassion”) in verse 16.
19:19	r6kn			לְ⁠הַחֲי֖וֹת אֶת נַפְשִׁ֑⁠י	1	“and saved my life.”

See how you translated “the mountain{s}” in verse 17.
19:19	swvd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	פֶּן תִּדְבָּקַ֥⁠נִי הָ⁠רָעָ֖ה וָ⁠מַֽתִּי	1	“before the disaster catches up with me and kills me.” or “before the disaster strikes/occurs and kills me.” The word “disaster” is personified here, that is, it is talked about as if it can act in human ways. Consider whether or not it would be clear and natural to do that here in your language.
19:20	scbl			הִנֵּה נָ֠א	1	“{So} listen {to this} please:” Consider again how you translated “Behold, please” in verses 2, 8, 19-20. It may be necessary to translate it in slightly different ways, depending on the context.
19:20	v9tb			הָ⁠עִ֨יר הַ⁠זֹּ֧את & שָׁ֖מָּ⁠ה	1	“That town up ahead” or “That town over there”. The Hebrew word for “town” here (and in verses 21-23) can refer to either a city or a town, depending on the context. Many translations have “town,” or even “village,” here because the place was very small (verses 20, 22). Many other translations have “city” here instead, but that does not fit the context.
19:20	rts1			קְרֹבָ֛ה לָ⁠נ֥וּס	1	“{is} near/close {enough} to flee/run to {in time},”
19:20	mw43			וְ⁠הִ֣יא מִצְעָ֑ר	1	“and it {is} {just/only} a little/small {town}.” or “and it {is} little/small.”

19:20	dubz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֥א מִצְעָ֛ר הִ֖וא	1	“{After all,} it is {only/just} a little/small place/town.” or “{After all,} it is very small.” This rhetorical question implies that it will not matter if such a small town like Zoar is not destroyed. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question works well here in your language.
19:20	nhzf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וּ⁠תְחִ֥י נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	“Then I/we will/can stay alive.” or “{If you let us go there,} then {my family and} I will live.” or “{If you allow that,} our lives will be saved/spared.” Lot says “my life,” but he is probably also including his family who is with him.
19:21	f6h0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	“The angel said/replied”. This phrase probably refers to the same angel who spoke to Lot in verse 17. Make sure it does not sound like Lot is the one speaking here.
19:21	v4mr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	“to Lot,”
19:21	zrvn			הִנֵּה֙	1	“Listen,” or “Alright,” or “Here {is what I will do}:”

19:21	m6y3			לְ⁠בִלְתִּ֛י הָפְכִּ֥⁠י	1	“and/so I will not overturn/destroy”
19:21	yu2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֶת הָ⁠עִ֖יר אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּֽרְתָּ	1	“the {little/small} town that you mentioned.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in the sentence and say, “I will allow you to go to the {small} town that you are talking about, and I will not destroy it.” Do what is best in your language.
19:22	z9fr			מַהֵר֙	1	“{But} hurry up {now} {and}” or “{But} go quickly {now} {and}”
19:22	dzir			הִמָּלֵ֣ט שָׁ֔מָּ⁠ה	1	“flee/run there,” or “escape/flee to that town,” Consider again how you translated “escape” in verses 17, 19-20, 22.
19:22	p51q			כִּ֣י לֹ֤א אוּכַל֙ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֣וֹת	1	“because I am not allowed to do/destroy anything” or “because I must wait to do/destroy anything” or “because {God} will not allow/permit me to do/destroy anything”. This clause implies that Yahweh will not allow the angel to destroy anything until Lot and his family arrive safely in the town of Zoar.
19:22	iw13			עַד בֹּאֲ⁠ךָ֖ שָׁ֑מָּ⁠ה	1	“until you get/reach there {safely}.” or “until you are {safely} there.”
19:22	vgig			עַל כֵּ֛ן	1	“That is why” or “Since Lot said the town was little/small,” This phrase refers back to what Lot said in verse 20, not what the angel just said.
19:22	nll4			קָרָ֥א שֵׁם הָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	“the town was called” or “they/people called that town” or “the name of the town is”. See how you translated “they called the name” in Gen 11:9 and 16:14.
19:22	hrvo			צֽוֹעַר	1	“Zoar, {which means “little/small.”}” If this implied information is included in your translation or in a footnote, be consistent here with how you translated the word “little” or “small” in verse 20.
19:23	nppm			הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖מֶשׁ יָצָ֣א עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“The sun was rising”. Make sure that the way verse 23 begins in your translation fits with the way verse 15 begins, which refers to the same day.
19:23	lo6p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וְ⁠ל֖וֹט	1	“as/when Lot {and his family}”. In that culture the father was often the only one mentioned and the other family members were assumed to be with him.
19:23	o3z7			בָּ֥א צֹֽעֲרָ⁠ה	1	“arrived at/in {the town of} Zoar.” or “reached{the town of} Zoar.”
19:24	attr			וַֽ⁠יהוָ֗ה הִמְטִ֧יר עַל סְדֹ֛ם וְ⁠עַל עֲמֹרָ֖ה גָּפְרִ֣ית וָ⁠אֵ֑שׁ	1	“Then Yahweh rained/poured down burning sulfur/rocks and fire on {the cities of} Sodom and Gomorrah” or “Then Yahweh caused fire and burning sulfur/rocks to rain/pour down on {the cities of} Sodom and Gomorrah”. The word “brimstone” refers to sulfur, which is a type of rock that is highly flammable. When it burns, it produces smoke, intense heat, and a bad smell like rotten eggs.
19:24	z1eq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	מֵ⁠אֵ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה מִן הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	“from himself in heaven,” or “from out of the heavens/sky,” Some translations omit the phrase “from Yahweh” since Yahweh is already mentioned earlier as the one doing this. Also, for some languages it may be better to change the order of phrases in this verse and say, “Then Yahweh caused fire and burning sulfur/rocks to fall/pour like {heavy} rain from the heavens/sky on {the cities of} Sodom and Gomorrah.” Do what is best in your language.
19:25	rfr1			וַֽ⁠יַּהֲפֹךְ֙	1	“and (so) he/Yahweh {completely} destroyed” or “In that way, he/Yahweh {completely} destroyed ” or “That is how he/Yahweh {completely} destroyed”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated a phrase with a similar meaning (“swept away”) in verses 15 and 17.
19:25	zwuj			אֶת הֶ⁠עָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔ל	1	“those {two} cities”
19:25	euza			וְ⁠אֵ֖ת כָּל הַ⁠כִּכָּ֑ר	1	“and the entire/whole plain/valley,” or “and the rest of the plain/valley,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were also in the plain/valley, not separate from it.
19:25	ao52			וְ⁠אֵת֙ כָּל יֹשְׁבֵ֣י הֶ⁠עָרִ֔ים	1	“including all the people who lived in the cities {of/in that plain/valley}” or “including everyone who lived in the cities {there}”. This phrase refers to Sodom and Gomorrah and at least two other cities in the valley (Deuteronomy 29:23).
19:25	rrut			וְ⁠צֶ֖מַח	1	“and {even} {all} the vegetation/plants”
19:25	g2sq			וְ⁠צֶ֖מַח הָ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	“{that were growing} on the ground/land.” or “of/in the/that area/region.”

19:26	q9a5			וַ⁠תְּהִ֖י	1	“and {immediately} she turned into” or “and {immediately} her body turned into” or “and {immediately} {God/Yahweh} turned her into”
19:26	trht			נְצִ֥יב מֶֽלַח	1	“a column/statue of {solid} salt {rock} {and she died}.” or “salt {rock} that was in the shape of a pillar/column.”
19:27	t3yb			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּ֥ם אַבְרָהָ֖ם בַּ⁠בֹּ֑קֶר	1	“{Meanwhile,} Abraham got up early that {same} morning” or “Early that same morning, Abraham got up”. Some translations translate this as the next morning, but it is more likely that this was the same day when Lot arrived in Zoar and Yahweh destroyed the cities in the valley (verse 23).
19:27	qmne			אֶל הַ֨⁠מָּק֔וֹם	1	“and returned to the place/spot”
19:27	i49j			אֲשֶׁר עָ֥מַד & אֶת פְּנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	“where he had stood/been with Yahweh {the previous day},” or “where he had stood in Yahweh’s presence {the day before}.”
19:28	z2pg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּשְׁקֵ֗ף	1	“Then he/Abraham looked down” or “He looked down”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, make sure it is clear that Abraham, not Yahweh, is being referred to here.

Also, be consistent with how you spelled “Zoar” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:10; 14:2, 8; 19:22-23, 30.

19:34	ezgg			וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ מִֽ⁠מָּחֳרָ֔ת	1	“The next day, this is what happened:” or “The next day”. The phrase “Then it happened” introduces and emphasizes important information which the following narrative builds on. It also creates suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Some translations leave this phrase out, but doing that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language.

20:1	hy06			מִ⁠שָּׁ֤ם	1	“from the place where he/they were living” or “from near {the city of} Hebron”. Abraham and Sarah had been living by the trees of Mamre, near the city of Hebron (Gen 13:18; 18:1).

20:1	wu3o			וַ⁠יָּ֖גָר בִּ⁠גְרָֽר	1	“and they stayed/lived {there} for a while {as foreigners}, in {the city of} Gerar.” or “and they stayed/lived in {the city of} Gerar for a while.” See how you translated “sojourn” in Gen 12:10.

Some languages use special words for “sister” and “brother” in Gen 12:13, 19; 20:2, 5, 12-13, 16, to distinguish when someone is younger or older than his or her sibling. Do what is best in your language.

For some languages it is necessary to use an honorific title for a king each time (or most of the time) that he is referred to by name, in order to show him proper respect. Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter.
20:3	ompr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הַ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה	1	“{during} the night” or “by/at night” or “that night”.

20:3	votc			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר ל֗⁠וֹ	1	“and told/warned him,”
20:3	tkin			הִנְּ⁠ךָ֥ מֵת֙	1	“Listen {to me}, you are a dead man” or “Listen {to me}, you are about to die” or “Behold, {I have sentenced} you to die”. Make sure that the way you translate this clause does not make it sound like King Abimelech is already dead. God is telling King Abimelech what is about to happen to him.
20:3	couv			עַל הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֣ה אֲשֶׁר לָקַ֔חְתָּ וְ⁠הִ֖וא	1	“because the woman whom you have taken {to be your wife}”. See how you translated “took” in verse 2.

See how you translated a different phrase in Gen 19:31 (“come to us”) that has the same meaning.
20:4	giez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֕ר	1	“so he asked {God},” The way you translate this quote margin will depend on how you translate the rhetorical question that follows it.
20:4	ewc1			אֲדֹנָ֕⁠י	1	“My Master,” or “Lord/Master,” See how you translated this title of respect for God in Gen 18:27, 30-32.
20:4	on63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ג֥וֹי גַּם & תַּהֲרֹֽג	1	“will/would you kill {me and} my people {group} even if/though” or “please do not kill/destroy {me and} my people {group}, since”. King Abimelech uses a rhetorical question here to express his desperate concern. Abimelech is saying in a dramatic way that if God kills him, he will destroy the nation that Abimelech leads as their king. Make sure in your translation that he does not sound angry or rude. Also, see how you translated “nation” in Gen 18:18.
20:4	d8vu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	צַדִּ֖יק	1	“{we are} innocent?” or “{we are} {actually} righteous/innocent!” Consider again how you translated the word “righteous” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 6:9, 7:1, 18:23-26, 28; 20:4. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

20:6	ucn6			וָ⁠אֶחְשֹׂ֧ךְ גַּם־אָנֹכִ֛י אֽוֹתְ⁠ךָ֖ מֵ⁠חֲטוֹ־לִ֑⁠י	1	“and in fact, it is I who kept/prevented you from doing this sin against me.” or “In fact, I {am the one who} kept/prevented you from sinning against me.” In the Hebrew text, “I” is an emphatic pronoun. Try to communicate that emphasis in a natural way in your translation. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
20:6	fi98			עַל כֵּ֥ן	1	“That is why”
20:6	lhkk			לֹא נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	“I did not permit you to” or “I did not let you”

Also, for some languages it may be better to change the order of these clauses and say, “I {am the one who} did not allow/permit you to touch her so that you would not sin against me.” Do what is best in your language.
20:7	a0pv			וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	“Now then,”
20:7	zdzu			הָשֵׁ֤ב אֵֽשֶׁת הָ⁠אִישׁ֙	1	“give back the man’s wife” or “you must give Abraham’s wife back {to him}” or “return her/Sarah to her husband {Abraham}”
20:7	wp12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	כִּֽי נָבִ֣יא ה֔וּא	1	“He {is} a prophet/spokesman {for me},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, a prophet is someone who speaks for someone else. In this case, Abraham serves as an intercessor and speaks for God and prays what God wants him to say (verses 7,17). Avoid a translation of this term that focuses on telling the future, which is only one of the things that a prophet might do.
20:7	i31n			וְ⁠יִתְפַּלֵּ֥ל בַּֽעַדְ⁠ךָ֖	1	“and/so he will ask me to be merciful/kind to you,”

Make sure that is clear in your translation.
20:8	nr08			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם אֲבִימֶ֜לֶךְ בַּ⁠בֹּ֗קֶר	1	“So the next morning {King} Abimelech got up early” or “Early the next morning {King} Abimelech got up”

20:9	o1nm			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֲבִימֶ֜לֶךְ	1	“Then {King} Abimelech summoned Abraham” or “Then the king called Abraham in {to see him}” or “Then he had Abraham brought to him”. Consider what is the best way in your language to refer to King Abimelech at this point in the paragraph.
20:9	d4p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר ל֜⁠וֹ	1	“and asked him,” or “scolded him {by saying},” The way you translate this quote margin will depend on how you translate the rhetorical question that follows it.
20:9	n4ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מֶֽה עָשִׂ֤יתָ לָּ֨⁠נוּ֙	1	“Why have you treated us like this?” or “What you have done to us is not right!” or “You have treated us very badly!” Abimelech uses two rhetorical questions here to express his anger and to scold Abraham for what he had done. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question is the best way to communicate that in your language.
20:9	gqys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מֶֽה חָטָ֣אתִי לָ֔⁠ךְ כִּֽי	1	“What did I do wrong to you so that” or “I never did anything wrong to you, and/but yet”

20:10	y1ly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֲבִימֶ֖לֶךְ אֶל אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	“Finally, {King} Abimelech asked him,” For some languages it is more natural here to omit this quote margin, because the same person is still talking to the same person. However, the words emphasize what King Abimelech says next and may indicate that there was a pause between what he said in verse 9 and in verse 10. Do what is best in your language.

It is a complex term that means to recognize how holy and powerful God is and to deeply respect and honor him by obeying and worshiping him. Also, consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote.

Rather people paid each other with shekels of silver or gold shekels, which was a weight measurement. A thousand shekels of silver was about 25 pounds (11.5 kilos) of silver. Many translation teams like to keep the same numbers that are in the Hebrew text in their translation, and then in a footnote give the equivalent amount in their own currency. Other teams put the equivalent amount in the text and put the literal phrase in a footnote.

20:18	n7dw			עַל דְּבַ֥ר	1	“on account of” or “because he had taken” or “to punish him for taking”
20:18	lzt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	שָׂרָ֖ה אֵ֥שֶׁת אַבְרָהָֽם	1	“Sarah, Abraham’s wife.” or “Abraham’s wife Sarah.” For some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence (which begins in verse 17) and say, “{Before this,} Yahweh had completely closed up every womb in the household of {King} Abimelech because he had taken Abraham’s wife Sarah. Then Abraham prayed …” If the order is changed, it will be necessary to combine these two verses and to put the verse numbers “17-18” in front of the sentence. Some translation teams have decided that they will never combine verses like that. Other teams have decided that occasionally it is acceptable to do that if it makes the meaning clearer.

The same idiom is used in 1 Samuel 2:21 and Luke 1:68.
21:1	kuv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יַּ֧עַשׂ יְהוָ֛ה לְ⁠שָׂרָ֖ה	1	“Yes, Yahweh/he did for her” or “That’s right, Yahweh/he did for her”. The two halves of verse 1 form a parallelism to emphasize what God did for Sarah. In your translation it is best, if possible, to keep both parts of the parallelism, since each part has a different emphasis.
21:1	b6xq			כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבֵּֽר	1	“{just} as he had said {he would do}” or “{exactly} what he had promised {to do},”

Do what is best in your language.
21:4	hw25			וַ⁠יָּ֤מָל אַבְרָהָם֙	1	“And Abraham/he {also} circumcised”. Abraham may have circumcised Isaac (verse 4) on the same day that he named him (verse 3). See how you translated “circumcised” in Gen 17:10-14.

21:17	p37b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל תִּ֣ירְאִ֔י כִּֽי שָׁמַ֧ע אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶל ק֥וֹל הַ⁠נַּ֖עַר בַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוּא שָֽׁם	1	“Do not be afraid, because God has heard the cries/sobs of the boy/youth where he is lying {and will take care of him}.” or “Do not be afraid. God has heard the boy/youth crying over there {and will take care of him}.” or “God has heard the boy/youth crying over there, so do not be afraid {because he will take care of you both}.” The phrase “has listened to” means that God heard the boy and that he will help him.
21:18	xxt8			ק֚וּמִי שְׂאִ֣י אֶת הַ⁠נַּ֔עַר	1	“{So} go help the boy/youth to get/stand up,” or “{So now,} go to your son, help him get/stand up,”
21:18	cazv			וְ⁠הַחֲזִ֥יקִי אֶת יָדֵ֖⁠ךְ בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“and hold/lead him by the hand {to help him walk},” or “and take care of him,”
21:18	l3mg			כִּֽי & אֲשִׂימֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	“because I {Yahweh} will make him become {the ancestor of}” or “because Yahweh will make his descendants become”. The pronoun “I” refers to Yahweh here. So either Yahweh had taken on the form of an angel, or the angel was representing Yahweh and speaking for him. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 16:10. Also, see how you translated “make … into a great nation” in verse 13. Also see 18:18, which is similar.
21:18	yl2m			לְ⁠ג֥וֹי גָּד֖וֹל	1	“an important/large people/ethnic group.” See how you translated “nation” in verse 13.

21:19	hole			בְּאֵ֣ר מָ֑יִם	1	“a water well.” or “a well.” See how you translated “well” in Gen 16:14.
21:19	omv9			וַ⁠תֵּ֜לֶךְ	1	“So/Then she went/walked over {to the well},”
21:19	a7ik			וַ⁠תְּמַלֵּ֤א אֶת הַ⁠חֵ֨מֶת֙ מַ֔יִם	1	“filled the/her {water} container/bag {with} water,” See how you translated “skin” in verses 14-15.
21:19	k9hm			וַ⁠תַּ֖שְׁקְ אֶת הַ⁠נָּֽעַר	1	“and gave her son some water to drink.” or “and gave Ishmael a drink {from it}.”
21:20	t51d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְהִ֧י אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֶת הַ⁠נַּ֖עַר	1	“God was with the boy/youth {and helped/blessed him},” This clause means that God guided, helped, protected, and blessed Ishmael, that is, he took care of him. Consider whether or not your language has an idiom that fits well here. Also consider again how you translated “boy/youth” in verses 12, 17-20.
21:20	x2tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יִּגְדָּ֑ל וַ⁠יֵּ֨שֶׁב֙	1	“as he grew up/older.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse and say, “As the boy/youth grew up/older, God was with him {and helped/blessed him}.” Do what is best in your language.
21:20	s0rv			וַ⁠יֵּ֨שֶׁב֙ בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּ֔ר	1	“And he lived in the wilderness/desert {of Paran}” or “He lived in the {Paran} Wilderness/Desert”. For some languages it is more natural to specify here in verse 20 that the name of the wilderness is Paran, rather than wait until verse 21, so that it is clear that both verses refer to the same wilderness. See how you translated “the wilderness” in verse 14.
21:20	n9h4			וַ⁠יְהִ֖י רֹבֶ֥ה קַשָּֽׁת	1	“and became a skilled/expert bowhunter/archer.” or “and learned to hunt skillfully with a bow {and arrows}.”

21:21	vi5d			מֵ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם	1	“{who was/came} from the country of Egypt.” or “who was Egyptian.” See how you translated “the land of Egypt” in Gen 13:10.

Do what is best in your language.
21:22	zrmj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֱלֹהִ֣ים עִמְּ⁠ךָ֔ בְּ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר אַתָּ֖ה עֹשֶֽׂה	1	“{I have noticed that} God {is} with you {and helps/blesses you} in everything that you do.” See how you translated a similar phrase (“God was with …”) in verse 20.
21:23	dapc			וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	“So now, {please}” or “Now then, {please}”. King Abimelech’s words to Abraham should sound polite and respectful in your translation, not rude or demanding. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 20:7.
21:23	k01e			הִשָּׁ֨בְעָ⁠ה לִּ֤⁠י בֵֽ⁠אלֹהִים֙ הֵ֔נָּה	1	“swear/vow to me here in God’s presence” or “solemnly promise me here with God as your witness”. To “swear … by God” means that Abraham would be accountable to God, asking him to be his witness and to punish him if he breaks his oath/vow/promise to King Abimelech. It does not mean that Abraham used swear words or other foul language. If this custom is not familiar to many people in your language area, you could put this information in a footnote. See how you translated a similar sentence in Gen 14:22.
21:23	w3li			אִם תִּשְׁקֹ֣ר לִ֔⁠י וּ⁠לְ⁠נִינִ֖⁠י וּ⁠לְ⁠נֶכְדִּ֑⁠י	1	“that you will never {again} deceive me or my children or my descendants.”

21:23	vmpq			אֲשֶׁר גַּ֥רְתָּה בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	“where you are sojourning/living.” or “where you are living/staying {as a foreigner/outsider}.”

21:25	ngd9			אֶת אֲבִימֶ֑לֶךְ	1	“{King} Abimelech”. For some languages, it is necessary to include the title “King” every time that Abimelech (or any other king) is referred to by name. For other languages, it is more natural to use the title only occasionally (especially when the focus is on him), or perhaps only the first time he is referred to in a section (so that his status is clear). Do what is best in your language throughout this section.
21:25	osf1			עַל אֹדוֹת֙	1	“about/regarding”
21:25	p4mg			בְּאֵ֣ר הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם	1	“a well of water” or “a/the water well” or “a/the well”. See how you translated “well of water” in verse 19.

21:31	r5gz			עַל כֵּ֗ן	1	“That is why” or “Therefore/So” or “{Abimelech accepted the lambs,} so”
21:31	ace1			קָרָ֛א לַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	“Abraham called/named that place” or “they/people call that place” or “that place was/is called”. The phrase “he called” often means that people in general gave a city or other place a certain name. Here it could be that Abraham named the place Beersheba, and then later other people called it the same name, and it became well known by that name. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 19:22.
21:31	h7pp			בְּאֵ֣ר שָׁ֑בַע	1	“Beersheba, {which means “Well of the Seven” or “Well of the Vow/Oath,”}” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Beersheba” in verse 14. Also, if you include the meaning of the name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure that the way you translate “vow” or “oath” here matches the way you translate “oath” later in this verse.
21:31	py2p			כִּ֛י שָׁ֥ם	1	“because it was there that” or “because that is where”
21:31	khcp			שְׁנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	“they both” or “he/Abraham and Abimelech both”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 27.

21:32	idhd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּכְרְת֥וּ בְרִ֖ית בִּ⁠בְאֵ֣ר שָׁ֑בַע	1	“After Abraham and {King} Abimelech made/established their {peace} treaty/agreement at Beersheba,” Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun or nouns here to refer to these men. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for “they” that fits well here. Also, see how you translated the idiom “cut … covenant” in verse 27.
21:32	usgz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֣קָם אֲבִימֶ֗לֶךְ וּ⁠פִיכֹל֙ שַׂר צְבָא֔⁠וֹ	1	“Abimelech and Phicol, his army commander/captain, left {from there}” or “Abimelech and his army commander/captain Phicol left {Abraham}”. See how you translated “got up” in verse 22.
21:32	ql0j			וַ⁠יָּשֻׁ֖בוּ	1	“and went back”
21:32	qzuk			אֶל אֶ֥רֶץ פְּלִשְׁתִּֽים	1	“to the land/territory where the Philistines lived.” or “to {their homes in} the Philistines’ land/territory {that Abimelech ruled over}.” Abimelech and Phicol probably returned to their homes in the city of Gerar (Gen 20:2), which at that time was the Philistines’ capital city, where Abimelech ruled from. The place in the desert where Abimelech and Abraham made their covenant (Beersheba) was probably located on the border of the Philistines’ territory.
21:33	txwk			וַ⁠יִּטַּ֥ע	1	“Then Abraham planted”
21:33	aoys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶ֖שֶׁל	1	“a salt-cedar tree” or “an {evergreen} tree {called/named} tamarisk/salt-cedar”. The tamarisk tree (also known as salt-cedar) is a small-leaved evergreen tree that grows up to 30 feet (9 meters) high and provides shade. It grows well in desert areas that have salty soil. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
21:33	y7os			בִּ⁠בְאֵ֣ר שָׁ֑בַע	1	“at {the place called} Beersheba,”
21:33	nqr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֨קְרָא שָׁ֔ם בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥ם יְהוָ֖ה	1	“and he worshiped/praised Yahweh by name there,” or “and he addressed Yahweh there by {his} name as he worshiped/praised him,” or “and there he worshiped/praised Yahweh,” See how you translated this clause in Gen 12:8 and a similar clause in 13:4.
21:33	kg6a			אֵ֥ל עוֹלָֽם	1	“{who is} the Eternal/Ever-existing God.” or “{who is} the God who lives forever.” or “{who is} the God who has always existed.” This phrase means that God has no beginning and no end. In other words, he has always existed and he will continue to exist forever.
21:34	fwun			וַ⁠יָּ֧גָר אַבְרָהָ֛ם	1	“After that, Abraham/he lived/stayed {there}”. See how you translated “sojourning” in verse 23.
21:34	iij4			בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ פְּלִשְׁתִּ֖ים	1	“in the land/territory that was ruled/occupied by the Philistines” or “in the land/territory where the Philistines lived/ruled” or “in Philistines’ territory”
21:34	rc8r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יָמִ֥ים רַבִּֽים	1	“for many years.” Abraham lived in the Philistines’ territory for around 25 years, so keep that in mind as you translate this phrase. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this time phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “… lived {there} for many years in the land …” Do what is best in your language.
22:1	oi54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י אַחַר֙ הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה	1	“Sometime after those things happened” or “Sometime later” or “Several years later”. This is the beginning of a new episode that takes place around twelve years after Abraham and King Abimelech made their treaty (chapter 21). See how you translated “after those events” in Gen 15:1; it may be necessary to translate this phrase in a slightly different way here because of the different context.
22:1	y0sj			וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים נִסָּ֖ה אֶת אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	“God {wanted/decided to} test Abraham.” Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like the test was over. Rather it introduces what the following episode is about.
22:1	krqu			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו אַבְרָהָ֖ם	1	“So {one day} he called to him, “Abraham!” ” or “He called to him, “Abraham!” ” or “{This is what happened:} He/God called to him, “Abraham!” ”
22:1	ed64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר	1	“Abraham replied/responded {to him},” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is speaking here.
22:1	padv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִנֵּֽנִ⁠י	1	“I’m listening, {Lord/Master}.” or “Yes, {Lord/Master}?” or “What is it, {Lord/Master}?” Abraham’s reply is respectful and means that he is listening and ready to do what God wants him to do. Consider what is the best way to say this phrase in your language.
22:2	kuxt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֡אמֶר	1	“Then God said {to him},” or “Then God commanded/told {him},” Translate this quote margin in a way that fits this context well.
22:2	yhh1			קַח נָ֠א אֶת בִּנְ⁠ךָ֨	1	“Take your son {with you},” See how you translated “please” when God is talking to a person in Gen 13:14; 15:5. Your translation of “take” here should not imply the use of force. See how you translated “took” in Gen 11:31 and 12:5.
22:2	b5q0			אֶת יְחִֽידְ⁠ךָ֤ אֲשֶׁר אָהַ֨בְתָּ֙ אֶת יִצְחָ֔ק	1	“{yes/indeed,} your only {son} Isaac whom you love,” This phrase repeats part of the previous phrase in order to emphasize it. Do what is natural in your language.
22:2	zek7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֶךְ לְ⁠ךָ֔	1	“and go/travel {with him}”. It is understood that he was to take Isaac with him. If this is not clear in your language, you could make that information explicit.
22:2	fsxs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶל אֶ֖רֶץ הַ⁠מֹּרִיָּ֑ה	1	“to the region of/called Moriah,” or “to the Moriah Region,”
22:2	fvbp			וְ⁠הַעֲלֵ֤⁠הוּ שָׁם֙ לְ⁠עֹלָ֔ה	1	“and sacrifice/offer him there {to me} as a burnt offering” or “There you are to burn him up {on an altar} as a sacrifice/offering {to me},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 8:20.
22:2	yxpj			עַ֚ל אַחַ֣ד הֶֽ⁠הָרִ֔ים	1	“on {top of} one of the mountains” or “on {top of} a mountain”
22:2	c0gi			אֲשֶׁ֖ר אֹמַ֥ר אֵלֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	“that I will show to you.” or “that I will point out to you.”
22:3	rmr5			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם אַבְרָהָ֜ם בַּ⁠בֹּ֗קֶר	1	“So the next morning, Abraham got up early” or “Early the next morning Abraham got up”. See how you translated “got up early in the morning” in Gen 20:8.
22:3	r4ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וַֽ⁠יַּחֲבֹשׁ֙ אֶת חֲמֹר֔⁠וֹ	1	“and put a {pack} saddle on his donkey {to get it ready} {for the trip}.” or “and got his donkey ready {for the trip}.” A donkey is like a small horse that people used to carry loads (as here).
22:3	cnmv			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֞ח אֶת שְׁנֵ֤י נְעָרָי⁠ו֙ אִתּ֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠אֵ֖ת יִצְחָ֣ק בְּנ֑⁠וֹ	1	“He took/brought two of his servants with him and his son Isaac,” or “Then he took/got his son Isaac and two of his servants,”
22:3	kxn0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְבַקַּע֙ עֲצֵ֣י	1	“and he chopped/split {some} {fire}wood {with them}” or “and they chopped {some} {fire}wood {together}”. The reason Abraham is the only one mentioned in this clause and in the next sentence is that he is in focus. He did not travel alone and he probably did not chop the wood alone. Decide whether or not you need to make that explicit in your translation.
22:3	pd14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עֹלָ֔ה	1	“{to use} for the burnt offering {and loaded it on the donkey}.” or “that they would use to burn the sacrifice/offering {and loaded it on the donkey}.” Some languages must translate this noun phrase using a verb. Do what is natural in your language. See what you did in verse 2.
22:3	tot6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֣קָם וַ⁠יֵּ֔לֶךְ אֶל הַ⁠מָּק֖וֹם	1	“Then he set out {with them} for/toward the place/mountain” or “Then they started traveling toward/to the place/mountain”. In this context, “got up” is used as an idiom that means Abraham started an activity. It does not mean that he was sitting down and literally stood up.
22:3	uasj			אֲשֶׁר אָֽמַר ל֥⁠וֹ הָ⁠אֱלֹהִֽים	1	“that God had told/commanded him/Abraham {to go to}.”

22:4	o9zt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֨א אַבְרָהָ֧ם אֶת עֵינָ֛י⁠ו	1	“Abraham/he looked up/ahead”. See how you translated the idiom “lifted his eyes” in Gen 18:2. It may be necessary to translate it differently here, because of the different context.
22:4	ql9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֶת הַ⁠מָּק֖וֹם מֵ⁠רָחֹֽק	1	“and he could see the place/mountain {where they were headed} in the distance.” or “and in the distance he could see the place/mountain {where they were headed/going}.” Consider where it is best in your language to put the location phrase “from a distance” or “in the distance”.
22:5	a4ha			וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֶל נְעָרָ֗י⁠ו	1	“Then Abraham/he told his servants,” Be consistent here with how you translated “young men” in verse 3.

22:5	dec5			וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י וְ⁠הַ⁠נַּ֔עַר נֵלְכָ֖ה	1	“while the young man and I go” or “while my son and I go”. See how you translated “the boy” in Gen 21:12, 17-20. We do not know for sure how old Isaac was at this time, but estimates range between 18 and 37 years old. Make sure your translation of “boy” allows for that fact.
22:5	g7di			עַד כֹּ֑ה	1	“over there {to that mountain}” or “{to the mountain} over there”
22:5	qx9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠נִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖ה	1	“and bow down {to worship God}.” or “and worship {God}.” In that culture, people had the custom of bowing down to worship God. Make sure it is clear in your translation why Abraham and Isaac would bow down.
22:5	xg6u			וְ⁠נָשׁ֥וּבָה אֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	“Then we will return to you {here}.” or “After that, we will come back {here} to you.”

22:6	opxt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֨שֶׂם֙ עַל יִצְחָ֣ק בְּנ֔⁠וֹ	1	“and loaded/put {it} on his son Isaac{’s shoulder/back} {to carry},” or “and gave {it} to his son Isaac to carry,” The Hebrew text does not specify exactly where Abraham put the wood on Isaac. Only specify that in a translation if it is necessary in your language.
22:6	jggs			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֣ח בְּ⁠יָד֔⁠וֹ	1	“and/while he himself carried” or “He himself carried”. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.
22:6	b8n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת הָ⁠אֵ֖שׁ	1	“a fire {pot} {with hot coals/embers in it}” or “the {other} things to make/start a fire”. The “fire” can either refer to hot coals (in a pot) or to a flint stone and wood chips that they would use to start the fire on the altar. Make sure that your translation of this phrase does not mean that Abraham was holding fire or hot coals in his bare hands.
22:6	h7lb			וְ⁠אֶת הַֽ⁠מַּאֲכֶ֑לֶת	1	“and a knife {to kill the sacrifice}.” or “and a {sacrifice} knife.”

22:9	k8uv			וַֽ⁠יַּעֲרֹ֖ךְ אֶת הָ⁠עֵצִ֑ים	1	“and laid/put the wood {on top of it}.” Abraham arranged the wood on top of the altar so that it would burn well. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like he lit the fire yet; he did not do that until verse 13 when he sacrificed the ram.
22:9	i4fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲקֹד֙ אֶת יִצְחָ֣ק בְּנ֔⁠וֹ	1	“Then he bound/tied his son Isaac{’s arms and legs} {with rope}”.

Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun or a pronoun to refer to Abraham here. See how you translated “knife” in verse 6.
22:10	ycq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ⁠שְׁחֹ֖ט אֶת בְּנֽ⁠וֹ	1	“{in order} to kill his son {before sacrificing/burning his body on the altar}.” In the process of sacrificing, the first step was to kill the sacrifice and then burn up the body on the altar. If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or in a footnote.
22:11	m7u5			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א & מַלְאַ֤ךְ יְהוָה֙	1	“But {before he/Abraham could use the knife,} an angel from Yahweh called/shouted” or “But {just then} one of Yahweh’s angels called/shouted”. Make sure in your translation that it does not sound like Abraham killed Isaac. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 21:17.
22:11	emlx			אֵלָ֜י⁠ו & מִן הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֣ם אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	“to him/Abraham from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” ” The angel repeats Abraham’s name to communicate urgency and that he wants him to stop and listen. Make sure your translation does not sound like the angel was angry or criticizing Abraham.
22:11	ea4o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	2	“Abraham replied {to the angel},”
22:11	bges		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִנֵּֽנִ⁠י	1	“I’m listening, {Lord/Master}.” or “What is it, {Lord/Master}?” or “Yes, {Lord/Master}?” See how you translated “Behold me” in verse 1.
22:12	u0h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“Then the angel said,” or “Then the angel told him,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the angel is speaking here, not Abraham.
22:12	htic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַל תִּשְׁלַ֤ח יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֙ אֶל	1	“Do not lay your hands on” or “Do not harm/kill”. Consider whether your language has an idiom that has the same meaning as the Hebrew idiom here.
22:12	vytx			הַ⁠נַּ֔עַר	1	“the young man” or “your son”. See how you translated this in verse 5.
22:12	qdxh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠אַל תַּ֥עַשׂ ל֖⁠וֹ מְא֑וּמָּה	1	“Do not do anything to {harm} him” or “You must not do anything to {harm} him” or “You must not harm him in any way”. The angel repeats the previous command (using different words) in order to emphasize that Abraham should not hurt Isaac. Most languages can do something similar. Do what is natural in your language.
22:12	dilb			כִּ֣י עַתָּ֣ה יָדַ֗עְתִּי	1	“Now I know/see” or “You have shown me”. Yahweh is the one talking here, represented by the angel who speaks on his behalf, or perhaps God is appearing to Abraham as an angel.
22:12	fr8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	כִּֽי יְרֵ֤א אֱלֹהִים֙ אַ֔תָּה	1	“that you fear/revere me” or “that you deeply respect me”. See how you translated “fear” in Gen 20:11.

22:13	q7w3			וְ⁠הִנֵּה אַ֔יִל אַחַ֕ר	1	“and suddenly he saw a ram behind {him}” or “and there behind {him} he saw a ram”. A ram is an adult male sheep or goat. See how you translated this term in Gen 15:9.
22:13	t9hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נֶאֱחַ֥ז בַּ⁠סְּבַ֖ךְ בְּ⁠קַרְנָ֑י⁠ו	1	“that had caught/tangled its horns in the thicket/bushes.” or “that had its horns caught/stuck in a bush.”

Do what is best in your language.
22:13	p6og		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּעֲלֵ֥⁠הוּ לְ⁠עֹלָ֖ה	1	“{Then he killed/slaughtered the ram} and burned it on the altar as a sacrifice/offering {to God}”. Animals that were sacrificed to God as burnt offerings were killed first before they were burned on an altar. Make sure your translation does not sound like the ram was burned alive. If that is not clear, you could make some of the above implied information explicit in your translation.
22:13	bk1e			תַּ֥חַת בְּנֽ⁠וֹ	1	“in place of his son.” or “as a substitute for his son.”
22:14	hiz5			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א אַבְרָהָ֛ם שֵֽׁם־הַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	“That is why Abraham called/named that place” or “{Because God provided the ram,} Abraham called/named that place”. Make sure it is clear that what Yahweh did in verse 13 is the reason that Abraham gave that place the name “Yahweh-Yireh” in verse 14.
22:14	fs0p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יְהוָ֣ה יִרְאֶ֑ה	1	“Yahweh-Yireh, {which means “Yahweh will see/provide,”}” or “Yahweh Will See/Provide,” If you include the meaning of this name in your translation text or in a footnote, be consistent with how you translate the verb “see/provide” in verse 8 (and later in verse 14), which the name is based on.
22:14	scaj			אֲשֶׁר֙ יֵאָמֵ֣ר הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	“{Even} today/now people {still} say,” This refers to the time period when Moses was writing this book. If that is not clear, you could put that information in a footnote.

22:14	v6oq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יֵרָאֶֽה	1	“it will be provided {by him}.” or “he will see to it {that we have what we need}.” or “he will provide what we/you need.” See how you translated this idiom in verse 8.

22:17	ufpq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠כוֹכְבֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	“{as many/numerous} as the stars in the heavens/sky”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is comparing the number of stars and grains of sand to the number of descendants Abraham will have. There will be so many that no one can count them all (as in Gen 13:16 and 15:6).
22:17	bf0s			וְ⁠כַ⁠ח֕וֹל אֲשֶׁ֖ר עַל שְׂפַ֣ת הַ⁠יָּ֑ם	1	“and {as many/numerous} as the {grains of} sand on the seashore,”

The gates in the walls were the only way to go in or out of a city. The idiom “possess the gates of … enemies” refers to taking control of the cities and conquering the people living there. Consider what is the best way to translate this idiom in your language.
22:18	ropw			בְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	“In/Through your offspring/descendants” or “Because of your offspring/descendants” or “By means of your offspring/descendants”. See how you translated “offspring” in verse 17.

22:18	emd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עֵ֕קֶב אֲשֶׁ֥ר שָׁמַ֖עְתָּ בְּ⁠קֹלִֽ⁠י	1	“because you heeded/obeyed my command.” or “{I will do that} because you obeyed me.” Make sure your translation of “my voice” refers to what God commanded Abraham. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
22:19	nybt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֤שָׁב אַבְרָהָם֙	1	“After that, Abraham returned {with Isaac}” or “Afterwards/Then Abraham {and Isaac} went back”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham returned alone (without Isaac).
22:19	tr07			אֶל נְעָרָ֔י⁠ו	1	“to his/the {two} servants”. Be consistent here with how you translated “young men” in verses 3 and 5.

So in your translation, it should not sound like Beersheba was a new destination; they were returning home.
22:19	q7m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב אַבְרָהָ֖ם בִּ⁠בְאֵ֥ר שָֽׁבַע	1	“and Abraham {and his family} stayed there.” or “and Abraham continued to live there {with his family}.” or “where Abraham {and his family} continued to live.” Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham was living alone in Beersheba apart from his family.

22:21	wmd4			אֶת ע֥וּץ בְּכֹר֖⁠וֹ וְ⁠אֶת בּ֣וּז אָחִ֑י⁠ו וְ⁠אֶת קְמוּאֵ֖ל	1	“{including} their firstborn/oldest son Uz, then Buz and Kemuel,” or “The first/oldest son/one {is} Uz, {the second is} Buz, and {the third is} Kemuel,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
22:21	rvcd			אֲבִ֥י אֲרָֽם	1	“{who is} the father of Aram.” or “who fathered Aram.” or “whose son is Aram.”
22:22	szt9			וְ⁠אֶת	1	“{They} also {have sons named}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that the people listed in verse 22 were sons of Nahor and Milcah, not sons of Kemuel (verse 21). Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
22:22	zhtn			כֶּ֣שֶׂד וְ⁠אֶת חֲז֔וֹ וְ⁠אֶת פִּלְדָּ֖שׁ וְ⁠אֶת יִדְלָ֑ף וְ⁠אֵ֖ת בְּתוּאֵֽל	1	“Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” Consider whether it is best in your language to use a conjunction between each name in this list (like Hebrew does), or only before the last name in the list. See what you did for a similar list of names in Gen 10:26-29.
22:23	hgj2			וּ⁠בְתוּאֵ֖ל יָלַ֣ד אֶת רִבְקָ֑ה	1	“Bethuel was the father of Rebekah.” or “Bethuel had {a daughter named} Rebekah.” Some translations put this sentence in parentheses to show that it is a separate comment by the author and not part of the previous quote. Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated “fathered” in Gen 11:27.

23:1	xsnc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	שְׁנֵ֖י חַיֵּ֥י שָׂרָֽה	1	“{Yes,} that is how long she lived” or “That is how old she lived to be”. Consider whether it is better in your language to combine the last part of verse 1 with the beginning of verse 2 and say, “That is how old she was when she died in Kiriath Arba …”
23:2	gq6y			וַ⁠תָּ֣מָת שָׂרָ֗ה	1	“Then she died” or “before she died”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the previous sentence.
23:2	uigf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠קִרְיַ֥ת אַרְבַּ֛ע	1	“in {the city of} Kiriath Arba,” or “in {the city of} Kiriath-arba,” You can spell this name as two words, as in the Hebrew text, or combine them into one word with or without a hyphen. Be consistent with how you spell this name throughout the Bible.
23:2	zc7g			הִ֥וא חֶבְר֖וֹן	1	“which {is also/now called/named} Hebron,” or “also/now known as Hebron,” or “that is, Hebron,” The city of Kiriath Arba was later named Hebron (Joshua 14:15).
23:2	ptzp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1	“in the land/region of/called Canaan.” For some languages it is more natural to put a general location before a specific location and say, “in the land of Canaan, in {the city of} Kiriath Arba, which {is} Hebron.” Do what is best in your language.
23:2	y3fa			וַ⁠יָּבֹא֙ אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	“Then Abraham went/came {to her}” or “Abraham went/came {to her side}”

Do what is best in your language.
23:3	ad8l			וַ⁠יָּ֨קָם֙ אַבְרָהָ֔ם מֵ⁠עַ֖ל פְּנֵ֣י	1	“Later he got/stood up from {mourning} beside” or “After a while, Abraham/he left”

Consider what is the best way to refer to them here in your language. Also, for some languages it is necessary to make it explicit here in verse 3 that Abraham went to the city gates to meet with the Hittites, rather than wait until verse 10 for that information. Do what is best in your language.
23:4	s4tz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אָנֹכִ֖י	1	“I {am coming to you as}” or “{As you know,} I {am}” or “{Since} I {am}”. The leaders of the city already knew that Abraham was a foreigner, so make sure your translation of this sentence does not sound like he is telling them something that they did not know.
23:4	i6f1			גֵּר וְ⁠תוֹשָׁ֥ב	1	“a foreigner/outsider who has settled” or “a foreigner/outsider who is living”. See how you translated “foreigner” in Gen 15:13.
23:4	rxen		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עִמָּ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“among you {and I have no land/property of my own}.” or “in your land {and/so I do not own any property here}.” It is implied by Abraham and understood by the Hittites that Abraham’s status as a foreigner means he owns no property. Consider whether or not to make this implied information explicit in your translation.
23:4	ck58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	תְּנ֨וּ לִ֤⁠י	1	“{Please} give/sell me” or “{Please} let me buy”. Make sure that the way you translate this phrase sounds polite, not rude or demanding.

Rather, the Hittites are addressing him in a respectful manner. Also, for some languages it is more natural or respectful to put the form of address “My lord” or “Sir” first in this quote. Do what is best in your language.
23:6	dlnm			נְשִׂ֨יא אֱלֹהִ֤ים אַתָּה֙	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “You {are} a powerful/important leader/man” or (2) “You {are} a leader/man of/from God”. The interpretation that you do not follow in your translation could be put in a footnote.
23:6	i7x9			בְּ⁠תוֹכֵ֔⁠נוּ	1	“{living} among us.” or “{who lives} among our people.”
23:6	i3yv			קְבֹ֖ר	1	“{So} {you may} bury/put”. Make sure that the reply of the Hittites sounds polite here in your translation.

23:6	p2vf			מֵתֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	“your dead/deceased {wife}.” or “{the body of} your wife who has died.” or “her.” Consider what is the best way in your language to refer to Sarah’s dead body here since it was just mentioned in the previous sentence.
23:7	x7ub			וַ⁠יָּ֧קָם אַבְרָהָ֛ם	1	“So Abraham got/stood up” or “Abraham got/stood up”. The verb “got up” reflects the fact that Abraham and the leaders/elders of the Hittites were all sitting as they talked to each other.
23:7	erok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ	1	“and bowed {in respect}” or “and bowed down/low {to the ground} {in respect}” or “and kneeled and touched his forehead to the ground {in respect}”. We do not know how far Abraham bowed down. He may have bowed his upper body from a standing position, or he may have knelt down and touched his forehead to the ground with his arms outstretched.
23:7	rwqv			לְ⁠עַם הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ לִ⁠בְנֵי חֵֽת	1	“in front of {the leaders/elders of} the Hittites, who owned the land {in the area}” or “before the leaders/elders over the Hittites”. The phrase “people of the land” is a term that refers to the leaders of that region who owned land in the area and were the ones to decide whether a foreigner could acquire land.
23:8	hd9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אִתָּ֖⁠ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“and said to them,” or “Then he said to them,” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to have two verbs or just one verb in this quote margin.

23:10	rq1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יַּעַן֩ אֶת אַבְרָהָם֙	1	“so/and he replied to Abraham”

23:10	w1wf			לְ⁠כֹ֛ל בָּאֵ֥י שַֽׁעַר־עִיר֖⁠וֹ	1	“including everyone who had gathered {there} at their/the city gate,” The pronoun “his” refers back to “everyone” who had gathered at the city gate, not just one person. Also, in that culture, the leaders of a city would hold their meetings at the city gates, where they would make decisions on important matters such as the one Abraham brought before them. You could include that information in a footnote.
23:10	r2ii		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	“He said,” or “This is what he said:” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

See how you translated “in the ears of” in verse 10.

23:13	ul13			אִם אַתָּ֥ה ל֖וּ	1	“if you are willing,” or “since you are willing {to let me have the field},” In verses 9-15, Abraham and Ephron are bargaining indirectly with each other according to the customs of that culture and time. Keep that in mind as you translate their conversation.

Rather people paid each other with shekels of silver or gold, which was a weight measurement. Four hundred shekels of silver was about 10 pounds (4.5 kilos) of silver. Many translation teams like to keep the same numbers that are in the Hebrew text in their translation, and then in a footnote give the equivalent amount in their own currency. Other teams put the equivalent amount in the text and put the literal phrase in a footnote. See how you translated “shekels of silver” in Gen 20:16.

23:15	uilj			וְ⁠אֶת מֵתְ⁠ךָ֖ קְבֹֽר	1	“So {go ahead and} bury your dead/deceased {wife} {there}.” Consider again how you translated “bury … dead” in verses 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, and 15.

23:17	x93p			אֲשֶׁ֖ר לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י מַמְרֵ֑א	1	“east of {the city of} Mamre,” or “near {the city of} Mamre,” Mamre was another name for the city of Hebron (verse 19). The name probably came from Abraham’s friend and ally who lived there (Gen 13:18; 14:13).

23:20	ujmp			וַ⁠יָּ֨קָם הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֜ה וְ⁠הַ⁠מְּעָרָ֧ה אֲשֶׁר־בּ֛⁠וֹ לְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֖ם	1	“So {that is how} that field, including the cave that {was} in the field, was/were {officially/legally} sold to Abraham” or “So {in that way,} the field {of Ephron}, including …” Verse 20 is a concluding summary of chapter 23 and repeats parts of verses 17-18. Make sure that the way you translate this does not sound like Abraham bought another property from the Hittites.
23:20	z30w			לַ⁠אֲחֻזַּת קָ֑בֶר מֵ⁠אֵ֖ת בְּנֵי חֵֽת	1	“by the Hittites as a burial place/site.” or “by the Hittites, so that he had a place where he could bury {his wife who had died}.” Consider again how you translated “a burial place” in verses 4, 9, and 20, and how you translated “the sons of Heth” in verses 3, 5, 7, 10, 16, 18, and 20.
24:1	wzyg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֣ם זָקֵ֔ן בָּ֖א בַּ⁠יָּמִ֑ים	1	“Abraham had lived a long time and was {now} {very} old,” or “Abraham was very old now. He had lived many years,” or “Now Abraham had become very old,” Verse 1 gives the setting for the new episode and begins with a doublet that emphasizes how old Abraham was. Try to preserve this emphasis in a way that is natural in your translation.
24:1	saka			וַֽ⁠יהוָ֛ה בֵּרַ֥ךְ אֶת אַבְרָהָ֖ם	1	“and Yahweh had blessed him” or “and Yahweh had caused him to prosper”. See how you translated “bless” in Gen 12:2-3.

24:2	b4i8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֗ם אֶל	1	“{One day} Abraham/he told”. Consider what is the best way to introduce the first event in this episode in your language.
24:2	joaf			עַבְדּ⁠וֹ֙ זְקַ֣ן בֵּית֔⁠וֹ	1	“the oldest servant in his household,” or “his senior/chief household servant,”
24:2	k6ua			הַ⁠מֹּשֵׁ֖ל בְּ⁠כָל	1	“who managed everything that he owned,” or “who took care of his entire estate for him,”
24:2	onzf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	שִֽׂים נָ֥א יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ תַּ֥חַת יְרֵכִֽ⁠י	1	“Please put your hand under my thigh/leg {to show that you will do what I ask}”. You can make the meaning of this custom explicit in your translation, or you can put that information in a footnote. What Abraham asks his servant to do here is part of the vow-making process in verse 3.
24:3	t966		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וְ⁠אַשְׁבִּ֣יעֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	“I want you to vow {to me}” or “and swear/vow {to me}” or “and make an unbreakable promise {to me}”. Decide the best way to translate this command in your language. Also, see how you translated “swear” in Gen 21:23, and see the note about that there.
24:3	d82y			בַּֽ⁠יהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם וֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵ֖י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“with Yahweh as your witness, the God who rules/created the heavens and the earth,” See how you translated “the heavens and the earth” in Gen 1:1.
24:3	j350		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא תִקַּ֤ח אִשָּׁה֙ לִ⁠בְנִ֔⁠י	1	“that you will not get/find/choose a wife/woman for my son {Isaac} {to marry} from {among}” or “that you will not arrange for my son {Isaac} to marry”. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make “Isaac” explicit here in verse 3 rather than wait until the end of verse 4. Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated the idiom “took a wife for” in Gen 21:21.
24:3	twy1			מִ⁠בְּנוֹת֙ הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י יוֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּ⁠קִרְבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“the Canaanite women whom we live among” or “{any of} the Canaanite women who live around us here”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham was living by himself among the Canaanites; his family and servants also lived among them with him.
24:4	bs9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	כִּ֧י & תֵּלֵ֑ךְ	1	“Rather/Instead, you must go” or “Rather/Instead, I want you to go”

24:4	e2z3			וְ⁠לָקַחְתָּ֥ אִשָּׁ֖ה לִ⁠בְנִ֥⁠י לְ⁠יִצְחָֽק	1	“and find/choose a wife/woman {from there} for my son Isaac {to marry}.” or “and get/choose a wife/woman {from among them} for him {to marry}.” or “and arrange for him to marry one of their daughters.” The way you refer to Isaac here will depend on how you referred to him in verse 3.
24:5	b2aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָי⁠ו֙ הָ⁠עֶ֔בֶד	1	“Then the servant asked Abraham,” or “But {Abraham’s} servant asked him,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language so that it fits the context well.
24:5	m0tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	אוּלַי֙	1	“Suppose {that}” or “What {should I do} if”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 18:24, 28, 29.

24:6	z1c6			הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְ⁠ךָ֔ פֶּן תָּשִׁ֥יב אֶת בְּנִ֖⁠י	1	“{No,} be/make sure that you never take my son back” or “{No,} you must definitely not/never take my son back”

24:7	kqni			יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם	1	“{because} Yahweh, the God who rules/created the heavens,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that verse 7 gives the reason for verse 6. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here, and see how you translated “the God of the heavens” in verse 3.
24:7	m7st			אֲשֶׁ֨ר לְקָחַ֜⁠נִי מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אָבִ⁠י֮	1	“brought/led me {here} from my father’s household”

24:7	t9zo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לְ⁠זַ֨רְעֲ⁠ךָ֔ אֶתֵּ֖ן אֶת הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֑את	1	“I will give this land to your offspring/descendants” or “that he would/will give this land {where we live} to my descendants”. The phrase “this land” refers to the land of Canaan here, not the land where Abraham’s relatives lived. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote with a direct quote or an indirect quote.
24:7	zrxe			ה֗וּא יִשְׁלַ֤ח מַלְאָכ⁠וֹ֙ לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“He will send one of his angels ahead of you {to guide/help you},” If you begin a new sentence here, make sure that the previous sentence is well-formed and complete in your language. Also, see how you translated “angel” in Gen 22:11, 15.
24:7	ksow			וְ⁠לָקַחְתָּ֥	1	“so that you will {be able to} find/choose” or “so that you can find/get”
24:7	tdz1			אִשָּׁ֛ה לִ⁠בְנִ֖⁠י מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	“a wife/woman from there for my son {to marry}” or “a wife/woman from my home country/land for my son {to marry}.” See how you translated “take/find a wife for” in verses 3-4.
24:8	wcpk			וְ⁠אִם & הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁה֙	1	“However, if the woman {you find/choose}”
24:8	y2r9			לֹ֨א תֹאבֶ֤ה	1	“does not want” or “refuses”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 5.
24:8	rfey			לָ⁠לֶ֣כֶת אַחֲרֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“to come {back} {here} with you,” or “to follow you {back} {here},” See how you translated a similar phrase (“to come with me”) in verse 5.
24:8	mdi5			מִ⁠שְּׁבֻעָתִ֖⁠י זֹ֑את	1	“then you will be released/free from {keeping} this oath/vow that I am asking/requesting you to swear/make {today/now}.” or “then you will not have to keep/fulfill this binding/unbreakable promise that you are swearing/making to me {today/now}.” An oath is a serious, unbreakable promise or vow that is made before God to guarantee that it will be fulfilled. See how you translated the verb form of this word (“swear” or “vow”) in verse 3.
24:8	eey0			רַ֣ק	1	“Just” or “But {no matter what happens,}”
24:8	rucb			אֶת בְּנִ֔⁠י לֹ֥א תָשֵׁ֖ב שָֽׁמָּ⁠ה	1	“you must not/never take my son back to my home country/land!” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 6.

See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2. Also, in that culture, people owned servants and had complete authority over them. Make sure your translation of “master” and “servant” does not imply that the servant was mistreated. Servants were treated well, could hold important positions and were often considered as members of the master’s family. See how you translated a related term “mistress/owner” in Gen 16:4, 8-9.
24:9	ezs1			וַ⁠יִּשָּׁ֣בַֽע ל֔⁠וֹ	1	“and vowed to him” or “and made an oath/vow to him” or “and made an unbreakable promise to him”. See how you translated “swore” in verse 7 and “swear” in verse 3.
24:9	w2zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	“that he would do what he/Abraham had requested/told him to do.” or “that he would go get/find a wife/woman for Isaac.” Some languages need to make explicit what “this matter” refers to. Do what is best in your language.
24:10	l8l3			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֣ח הָ֠⁠עֶבֶד עֲשָׂרָ֨ה גְמַלִּ֜ים מִ⁠גְּמַלֵּ֤י אֲדֹנָי⁠ו֙	1	“Then/Next he got ten of his master’s camels ready {for the trip}”. Make sure that your translation of “took” does not imply that the servant stole the camels or valuable things from Abraham. Rather, the “good things” that he loaded on the camels included things that he would give as gifts to Isaac’s relatives (verse 53). Also, see how you translated “camels” in Gen 12:16.
24:10	zzj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֔לֶךְ וְ⁠כָל ט֥וּב אֲדֹנָ֖י⁠ו בְּ⁠יָד֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּ֗קָם	1	“and left {with some other servants}, taking with him many of his master’s valuable things {to give as gifts}. Then he” or “and after he loaded them with all kinds of valuable things from his master {to use as gifts}, he left {with some other servants} and”. For some languages, it is best to make it explicit here in verse 10 that other servants went with Abraham’s chief servant, rather than have them appear suddenly in verse 32. Do what is best in your language.
24:10	cwi1			וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ אֶל	1	“and made the {long} journey/trip to” or “Then he traveled to”. This was about a 800 kilometer (500 mile) trip and would take camels about seventeen days to complete. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
24:10	in1t			אֲרַ֥ם נַֽהֲרַ֖יִם	1	“{the region of} Aram Naharaim,”
24:10	pnrb			אֶל עִ֥יר נָחֽוֹר	1	“to Nahor’s city.” or “to the city where Nahor lived.” Nahor lived in the city of Haran (Gen 11:31-32). That information could be put in a footnote. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Nahor owned the city.
24:11	sqc8			וַ⁠יַּבְרֵ֧ךְ הַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֛ים מִ⁠ח֥וּץ לָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	“{When they arrived there,} Abraham’s servant had the camels kneel/lie down {to rest} outside the city”
24:11	csy7			אֶל בְּאֵ֣ר הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	“near its well” or “by/near the {community/public} well {that was there}”. Each town or city had a well where people from the city came to get their water. See how you translated “well of water” in Gen 21:19. You might need to translate this in a slightly different way here because of the different context.
24:11	qle5			לְ⁠עֵ֣ת עֶ֔רֶב	1	“It was evening time,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
24:11	ct2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠עֵ֖ת צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֹּׁאֲבֹֽת	1	“the time when the {young} women {of the city} came out to draw/get water {from the well} {for their families/homes}.” or “when the {young} women {of the city} were starting to come out {to the well} to draw/get water {for their families/homes}.” In that time and culture, there was no running water in homes so people had to come out to the city well to get water for their families.
24:12	jy5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֓ר	1	“Then Abraham’s servant said/prayed,” Consider what is the best way to begin this paragraph in your language.
24:12	ws5i			יְהוָ֗ה	1	“{Dear/Oh} Yahweh,” Consider what is the best way to begin this prayer in your language.
24:12	i0vz			אֱלֹהֵי֙ אֲדֹנִ֣⁠י אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	“{who is} the God {who takes care} of my master Abraham,” or “{who is} the God whom my master Abraham worships/serves,”

24:12	cv0l			הַקְרֵה נָ֥א לְ⁠פָנַ֖⁠י הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	“please help me do what I have come here to do today” or “please help me succeed today”
24:12	ixjs			וַ⁠עֲשֵׂה חֶ֕סֶד עִ֖ם	1	“and {in that way} show kindness to” or “and be kind to”
24:12	cgxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲדֹנִ֥⁠י אַבְרָהָֽם	1	“my master.” or “him.”
24:13	fd2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י נִצָּ֖ב עַל	1	“Look/See, {here} I am, standing beside/near” or “As you see/know, I am standing {here} beside/near”. Make sure in your translation that what Abraham’s servant says here to Yahweh sounds polite and respectful, not rude, demanding, or complaining. Also, he is not telling God something that God did not already know.
24:13	ulm2			עֵ֣ין הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	“this spring/well,” or “this spring-fed well,” The phrase “spring of water” (here and in verse 16) refers to the same well that is referred to in verses 11 and 20, which means that this was probably a spring-fed well. Some translation teams use only one term to refer to this spring or well throughout this chapter in order to prevent confusion. Decide what is best in your language.
24:13	awnn			וּ⁠בְנוֹת֙ אַנְשֵׁ֣י הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	“and the daughters of the townspeople” or “and the young women of/from the city”
24:13	jc9y			יֹצְאֹ֖ת לִ⁠שְׁאֹ֥ב מָֽיִם	1	“are coming out {here} to draw/get water.” See how you translated “draw/get water” in verse 11.
24:14	fw47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	וְ⁠הָיָ֣ה	1	“{Please} make it happen {that}”. Make sure that your translation of the servant’s request to God sounds polite.
24:14	w6tq			הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֗ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֹמַ֤ר אֵלֶ֨י⁠הָ֙	1	“when I say to one of the young women,” The phrase “young woman” is actually a single word in Hebrew (like the old English words “damsel” and “maiden”) and refers to a young woman who is old enough to get married, but has never been married before. Some languages have a single word for this; other languages prefer a phrase.
24:14	qkdm			הַטִּי נָ֤א כַדֵּ⁠ךְ֙	1	“Please lower your {water} jar/jug/pot”. The water containers that people used were usually made out of clay.
24:14	avo0			וְ⁠אֶשְׁתֶּ֔ה	1	“so that I can drink {some water},” or “so that I can have/take a drink {of water},”
24:14	mgn6			וְ⁠אָמְרָ֣ה	1	“and/if she says/replies {to me},” or “she will say {to me},”
24:14	ych4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	שְׁתֵ֔ה וְ⁠גַם גְּמַלֶּ֖י⁠ךָ אַשְׁקֶ֑ה	1	“Have/Take a drink, and I will also draw/get water for your camels”. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make one or both of the two embedded direct quotes in this verse into indirect quotes. For example you could say, “{Please} make it happen that when I ask one of the young women to lower her jug so that I can have a drink {of water}, she will offer me a drink and will also offer to draw water for my camels.” Do what is best in your language.
24:14	tgbs			אֹתָ֤⁠הּ הֹכַ֨חְתָּ֙	1	“{Then I will know that} she {is the one} you have chosen”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
24:14	hmob			לְ⁠עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֣ לְ⁠יִצְחָ֔ק	1	“{as a wife} for your servant Isaac.” or “to be the wife of Isaac who serves you,”
24:14	ys98			וּ⁠בָ֣⁠הּ אֵדַ֔ע כִּי עָשִׂ֥יתָ חֶ֖סֶד עִם אֲדֹנִֽ⁠י	1	“and that you have been kind/gracious to my master {Abraham}.” See how you translated “show kindness toward” in verse 12.
24:15	b9n9			וַֽ⁠יְהִי ה֗וּא טֶרֶם֮ כִּלָּ֣ה לְ⁠דַבֵּר֒	1	“Before Abraham’s servant had {even} finished speaking/praying {to God},” Many translations omit the phrase “Then it happened”, but this phrase emphasizes the events that follow it and adds suspense, so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Do what is natural in your language.
24:15	e70q			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֧ה	1	“just then {he saw}” or “suddenly {he saw}”. This phrase spotlights Rebekah and shows that she is the center of attention. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
24:15	h8p0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	רִבְקָ֣ה יֹצֵ֗את	1	“{a young woman named} Rebekah coming out {of the city}”. Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce Rebekah here for the first time in this episode. Some translations use an exclamation point to help show the excitement.
24:15	mbyu			אֲשֶׁ֤ר יֻלְּדָה֙ לִ⁠בְתוּאֵ֣ל	1	“She was the daughter of Bethuel,” or “Her father was Bethuel,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
24:15	xu2z			בֶּן מִלְכָּ֔ה אֵ֥שֶׁת נָח֖וֹר אֲחִ֣י אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	“{who was} the son of Milcah and Abraham’s brother Nahor.” or “and his/Bethuel’s parents were Abraham’s brother Nahor and Milcah.”
24:15	fygo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠כַדָּ֖⁠הּ עַל שִׁכְמָֽ⁠הּ	1	“She was carrying her/a water jug on her shoulder.” or “She had her/a water jar/jug on her shoulder.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “Rebekah was coming out {of the city} with/carrying her/a water jar/jug on her shoulder.” Do what is best in your language.
24:16	zld1			וְ⁠הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֗ טֹבַ֤ת מַרְאֶה֙ מְאֹ֔ד בְּתוּלָ֕ה	1	“She/Rebekah was a very beautiful unmarried young woman,” See how you translated “young woman” in verses 14 and 15.
24:16	ig54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִ֖ישׁ לֹ֣א יְדָעָ֑⁠הּ	1	“whom no man had ever slept with.” or “who had never slept with a man.” or “who had never had {marital/sexual} relations with a man.” See how you translated the idiom “not known a man” in Gen 19:8.
24:16	q92s			וַ⁠תֵּ֣רֶד	1	“She went/walked down”. Notice that the spring or well was at a place that was lower than the place where Abraham’s servant was standing.
24:16	x0t1			הָ⁠עַ֔יְנָ⁠ה	1	“to the spring/well” or “to the spring-fed well,” See how you translated “spring” in verse 13.
24:16	vgr9			וַ⁠תְּמַלֵּ֥א כַדָּ֖⁠הּ	1	“filled her jar/jug {with water},”
24:16	vj4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תָּֽעַל	1	“and came/walked {back} up {with/carrying it on her shoulder}.” If it is not clear, you may need to make it explicit in your translation that Rebekah still had the jar with her when she came up from the well or spring, especially since she lowers it from her shoulder in verse 18.
24:17	vyeh			וַ⁠יָּ֥רָץ הָ⁠עֶ֖בֶד לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֑⁠הּ	1	“Then {Abraham’s} servant ran/hurried to meet the young woman” or “Then the servant ran up to her”

Starting in verse 21 the Hebrew text takes Rebekah and Laban’s perspective and refers to Abraham’s servant as “the man”. This continues until verse 34, when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham’s servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as “Abraham’s servant” or “the servant” throughout this chapter.

Many translation teams keep the numbers and the names of weights that are used in the Bible text in their translation, and they may or may not put the modern equivalents in pounds or grams in a footnote. Other teams do the opposite. One beka was about 1/5 of an ounce (5.5 grams), and ten shekels (See below) was about 4 ounces (110 grams).

24:22	afe9			עַל יָדֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	“for her wrists”. The Hebrew term is ambiguous here; it can refer to hands, arms, or wrists. However in this context, the bracelets would have been put on the arms or the wrists.

24:23	m6vp			בַּת מִ֣י אַ֔תְּ הַגִּ֥ידִי נָ֖א לִ֑⁠י	1	“Please tell me who your father {is}.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The phrase “Please tell me” can go: (1) with the previous question (“Whose daughter {are} you?”); or (2) with the following question (“Is there a place...to lodge?”).  Since Abraham’s servant’s goal was to find a wife for Isaac who was one of Abraham’s relatives, the first interpretation seems most likely.
24:23	t1yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֲ⁠יֵ֧שׁ בֵּית אָבִ֛י⁠ךְ מָק֥וֹם	1	“{Also,} is there {enough} room/space at/in his house” or “{Also,} does your father have enough/any room in/at his house”. If you made “your father” explicit in the previous sentence, it may be more natural to refer to him with the pronoun “his” in this sentence.
24:23	pzbr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֖⁠נוּ	1	“for me and my men”. The pronoun “us” includes other servants who came with Abraham’s chief servant (as verse 32 shows). If your language has inclusive and exclusive forms of this pronoun, you should use the exclusive form here.

Also, in some cultures the father’s name is normally given first; in other cultures the mother’s name is normally first.
24:25	pbeh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	“Then she added/continued,” Some languages leave this quote margin implied here, because the same person is still talking to the same person. Other languages can keep the quote margin (like the Hebrew text does), to emphasize what Rebekah says next. The quote margin may also indicate that Rebekah paused before she said what she says in verse 25.

The word “prostrated” means he bowed low to the ground and touched his face or forehead to the ground with outstretched arms, in an act of worship. When combined with “bowed down” as in this verse, it is usually translated as “worshiped”.
24:27	kzzy			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“by saying,” or “He said,” The servant is worshiping God by bowing down and by what he says in verse 27.

See how you translated “kindness” in verses 12 and 14. The phrase “not abandoned” is a way of emphasizing that Yahweh had always been kind and faithful to Abraham.
24:27	inzl			אָנֹכִ֗י בַּ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ נָחַ֣⁠נִי יְהוָ֔ה	1	“and he has guided me on the road/journey {here}” or “{Yes,} Yahweh/he guided me on the/my journey/trip {here}”.

Verse 30 is a flashback of what had happened before Laban ran to the well (verse 29). Consider what is the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine verses 29-30 and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, “Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets she was wearing and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well.” If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29-30.

If you want to make it clear who “the man” refers to, you should still translate it generally, for example, “the man {I met at the well}” because when Rebekah said this, she did not yet know who he was.

Both terms refer to the same source of water. See the note about this at verse 13.

It could mean: (1) “the granddaughter of my master’s brother”, which refers to Nahor's granddaughter; or (2) “the daughter of my master’s relative”, which refers to Bethuel's daughter. Abraham’s brother Nahor was the father of Bethuel and the grandfather of Rebekah (Genesis 11:26; 22:20-23).
24:48	jwkn			לִ⁠בְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	“{to be the wife} for my master’s son.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that this refers to Abraham’s son, not Nahor’s or Bethuel’s son.

Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Abraham had two wives named Keturah.
25:2	qyyg			וַ⁠תֵּ֣לֶד ל֗⁠וֹ	1	“She/Keturah gave birth to sons for him/Abraham {whose names were}” or “She bore/had {sons} for/with him {whom they named}” or “They had sons together {whom they named}”. See how you translated “bore for him” in Gen 21:3; 24:47.

In that time and culture, a father would give his children their inheritance before he died.

The Hebrew word “Kedem” means “east” and refers to the region east of Canaan and the Dead Sea.

The phrase “gathered to his people” is a euphemism that refers to dying but also implies that God took his spirit to be with his ancestors who had already died. It is best to translate this phrase fairly literally since it teaches about life after death.
25:8	z547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַמָּֽי⁠ו	1	“his ancestors/relatives {who had already died}.” or “his ancestors/relatives {who had gone/died before him}.” or “his {deceased} ancestors/relatives.” Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like these ancestors were still alive. They had already died before Abraham died.

25:10	ekpo			מֵ⁠אֵ֣ת בְּנֵי חֵ֑ת	1	“from the Hittites.” The Hebrew text has two different ways to refer to the Hittites; compare the phrase here with verse 9 where a single Hebrew word is used to refer to this people group. See how you translated “the sons of Heth” in Gen 23:20.

Make sure your translation of this sentence does not sound like Sarah was buried there a second time.

Both refer to temporary or permanent places where people settled, surrounded by some sort of wall or fence. Also, many translations have “princes” here instead of “rulers,” but these Ishmaelite rulers were not actually sons of a king. See how you translated “rulers” in Gen 17:20.

Be consistent here with how you spelled “Havilah” in Gen 2:11; 10:7, 29 and “Shur” in Gen 16:7; 20:1. The name “Shur” means “wall”. The Wilderness of Shur may have been named after a city or fortification named Shur that was located near the eastern border of Egypt (Gen 16:7).

Or it could mean: (2) “They settled/lived in the presence of all their brothers/relatives.” or “They settled/lived among/near all their brothers/relatives.” or (3) “He/Ishmael died in the presence of all his brothers/relatives.” or “He/Ishmael died when/while all his brothers were still alive.”

If your translation team decides to do this, look at a Bible version that does this to know where to divide the clauses.
25:23	l1ey			וּ⁠שְׁנֵ֣י לְאֻמִּ֔ים	1	“Those two people groups” or “Those two ancestors” or “They”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

25:25	kyoh			וַ⁠יִּקְרְא֥וּ שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	“So his parents named him” or “So he was called/named”. The Hebrew text has “they” here, which probably refers to Esau’s parents and may include people in general after his parents named him.
25:25	t2t0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עֵשָֽׂו	1	“Esau, {which means “hairy.”}” Consider whether or not to include the meaning of Esau’s name in the text or in a footnote.

Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, make sure that it is clear in your translation that Esau and Jacob are being contrasted.
25:27	t5f0			יֹשֵׁ֖ב אֹהָלִֽים	1	“and stayed/worked close to home.” or “and {liked/preferred} to be/work at/near home.”
25:28	uzdf			וַ⁠יֶּאֱהַ֥ב יִצְחָ֛ק אֶת עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	“Isaac loved Esau {most},” or “Isaac’s favorite son was Esau,” Your translation should not sound like Isaac and Rebekah did not love both of their sons. Rather, they each had their favorite son.
25:28	dwdz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּי צַ֣יִד בְּ⁠פִ֑י⁠ו	1	“because he liked to eat the meat of wild animals/deer {that he/Esau hunted},” Make sure your translation of “he liked” refers here to Isaac, not Esau. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “Isaac liked to eat wild animal/deer meat, so his favorite son was Esau”. Do what is best your language.
25:28	gbyt			וְ⁠רִבְקָ֖ה אֹהֶ֥בֶת אֶֽת יַעֲקֹֽב	1	“but/whereas Rebekah loved Jacob {most}.” or “but/whereas Rebekah’s favorite son was Jacob.” See how you translated a similar clause earlier in this verse.

Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce the first event in this episode (following the background information in verses 27-28).
25:29	hj1w			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥א עֵשָׂ֛ו מִן הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה	1	“Esau came home from {hunting/working out in} the fields/country”. See how you translated “field” in verse 27.
25:29	wxqp			וְ⁠ה֥וּא עָיֵֽף	1	“and he {was/felt} exhausted/weak {from hunger}.” or “and he {was/felt} exhausted/weak {and hungry}.” or “extremely/very tired {and hungry}.” The Hebrew word for “exhausted” means Esau was very tired (perhaps even feeling faint) from his hunting or work, as well as hungry and thirsty from lack of food. Some languages have an idiom for this that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.

25:30	ems1			קָרָֽא שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	“he/Esau was/is {also} called/nicknamed” or “his/Esau’s nickname was” or “they/people called/nicknamed him”. Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific. Do what is best in your language.
25:30	q10m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֱדֽוֹם	1	“Edom, {which means “red.”}” You could include the meaning of “Edom” in your translation or in a footnote so that it is clear why Esau was given that name.

In Hebrew culture the firstborn son inherited twice as much as the rest of the children in the family (Deuteronomy 21:15-17). That information could be put in a footnote so that people understand what Esau was selling for a bowl of stew.
25:32	l21g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	“Esau said/responded {to him},”

Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
25:32	hxqu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לָ⁠מָּה זֶּ֥ה לִ֖⁠י בְּכֹרָֽה	1	“So how will my birthright benefit me {if I die}?” or “So my birthright is of no use/value/benefit to me {right now}!” Esau uses a rhetorical question to emphasize his point about how hungry he is. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question works well here in your language.

25:33	d5gk			וַ⁠יִּשָּׁבַ֖ע ל֑⁠וֹ	1	“So he/Esau swore/vowed to him/Jacob” or “So Esau made an unbreakable promise/vow to him/Jacob”. Make sure the way you translate this clause fits well with what Jacob just said.
25:33	xdmk			וַ⁠יִּמְכֹּ֥ר אֶת בְּכֹרָת֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠יַעֲקֹֽב	1	“that he had sold/traded his rights as the firstborn/oldest son to Jacob/him {for the stew/soup}.” or “that he was selling/giving his firstborn-son-rights to Jacob/him {in exchange for the stew/soup}.” See how you translated “sell your birthright” in verse 31. Also see how Hebrews 12:16 is translated, which refers to the same event.

Lentils are small, round, flat, reddish-brown legume seeds that grow inside a pod (similar to peas or beans). If lentils are not known in your area, you could describe them as “a type of legume/bean called lentils”.
25:34	l7h8			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אכַל וַ⁠יֵּ֔שְׁתְּ וַ⁠יָּ֖קָם וַ⁠יֵּלַ֑ךְ	1	“and Esau ate, drank, got/stood up, and left.” or “and Esau {quickly/hurriedly} ate the meal and left.” Consider what is the most natural way to translate this series of actions that happened quickly one after the other and shows how carelessly Esau treated his birthright.
25:34	y8f5			וַ⁠יִּ֥בֶז עֵשָׂ֖ו אֶת הַ⁠בְּכֹרָֽה	1	“So Esau showed that he did not value his rights as the firstborn/oldest son.” or “In that way, Esau treated his birthright {carelessly/flippantly} as if it had no/little value.” See how you translated “birthright” in verses 31-33.
26:1	zr1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	“Now there was”. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new episode.
26:1	my54			רָעָב֙	1	“{another} famine” or “{another} extreme/serious shortage/lack of food” or “{another} {time of} extreme/severe food shortage”. See how you translated “famine” in Gen 12:10.

26:1	znvb			בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	“during Abraham’s lifetime.” or “while Abraham was still alive.”
26:1	oa44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֧לֶךְ יִצְחָ֛ק	1	“So Isaac {and his family} went”. In your translation it should not sound like Isaac went alone to the city of Gerar; the rest of his family lived with him.
26:1	io2w			אֶל אֲבִימֶּ֥לֶךְ מֶֽלֶךְ פְּלִשְׁתִּ֖ים גְּרָֽרָ⁠ה	1	“went {for help} to the Philistine king Abimelech, {who lived} in {the city of} Gerar.”  or “went to {the city of} Gerar to {ask for help from} King Abimelech, who ruled over the Philistines.” Be consistent here with how you translated “{the city of} Gerar” in Gen 10:19; 20:1-2 and “Philistines” in Gen 10:14; 21:32, 34.
26:2	gxel		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֵּרָ֤א אֵלָי⁠ו֙ יְהוָ֔ה	1	“Then Yahweh came to Isaac”. See how you translated “appeared” in Gen 12:7. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to refer to Isaac here with his name or a pronoun.
26:2	d4sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	“and said {to him},” or “and told/commanded {him},” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this quote margin.
26:2	m265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל תֵּרֵ֣ד	1	“Do not go/travel south” or “Do not go/travel”. Egypt was lower in elevation and also south of the land of the Philistines. Many translations leave that information implied. Do what is best in your language.
26:2	zrjo			מִצְרָ֑יְמָ⁠ה	1	“to {the land/country of} Egypt,”
26:2	ytdn			שְׁכֹ֣ן בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֖ר אֹמַ֥ר אֵלֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	“{but rather} live/stay/reside in the/this land where/wherever I tell you {to live}.” or “{but rather} live where/wherever I tell you to live.”
26:3	esom			גּ֚וּר	1	“You must live/stay/reside for a while” or “Live/Stay/Reside temporarily {as a foreigner/outsider}”. See how you translated this term in Gen 12:10 and 19:9. You may need to translate it in slightly different ways, depending on the context.
26:3	rbvm			בָּ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֔את	1	“in this region,”
26:3	a5hr			וְ⁠אֶֽהְיֶ֥ה עִמְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	“and I will stay with you” or “and I will be/stay {right} beside you”. This clause means that God will guide, help, and protect Isaac and provide for his needs.
26:3	rnp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-keyterms	וַ⁠אֲבָרְכֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	“and prosper you.” or “cause you {and your family} to prosper.”

Begin this sentence in a way that makes that clear in your translation.
26:3	lqx8			וַ⁠הֲקִֽמֹתִי֙	1	“and I will continue to keep/fulfill”
26:3	nxyo			אֶת הַ⁠שְּׁבֻעָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֖עְתִּי לְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֥ם אָבִֽי⁠ךָ	1	“the vow/promise that I made to your father Abraham.” Consider again how you translated “oath” in Gen 24:8. It may be necessary to translate this word differently in different contexts.
26:4	g56u			וְ⁠הִרְבֵּיתִ֤י	1	“Yes, I will multiply” or “that I will multiply”. Verse 4 gives the details of the oath that is referred to in verse 3. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the sentence from verse 3.
26:4	w607		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	אֶֽת זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֙ כְּ⁠כוֹכְבֵ֣י	1	“multiply/increase {the number of} your offspring/descendants {so that they are as numerous/countless} as” or “make your offspring/descendants as numerous/many/countless as” or “give you so many offspring that they will be as numerous as”. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 22:17.
26:4	z0k0			כְּ⁠כוֹכְבֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	“as the {number of} stars in the sky,”
26:4	yt1e			וְ⁠נָתַתִּ֣י	1	“I will also give”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

26:4	ibhs			בְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	“In fact, through your offspring/descendants” or “And because of your offspring/descendants” or “In fact, by means of your offspring/descendants”. See how you translated this phrase and the following clause in Gen 22:18.

26:5	yet9			עֵ֕קֶב אֲשֶׁר	1	“{all} because” or “{I will do all that} because”. Verse 5 gives the reason that Yahweh will do everything that he says in verses 3 and 4. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
26:5	wtdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שָׁמַ֥ע אַבְרָהָ֖ם בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י	1	“Abraham obeyed me” or “Abraham {always} obeyed/did what I told him”. The phrase “my voice” stands for what Yahweh said to Abraham and also represents Yahweh himself.

Notice that the terms in this clause have much overlap in meaning.
26:6	mvz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב יִצְחָ֖ק בִּ⁠גְרָֽר	1	“So/Then Isaac {did/obeyed what God said/commanded and} stayed/settled {with his family} in {the city of} Gerar.” In your translation it should not sound like Isaac lived alone; the rest of his family lived with him.

See how you translated “the men of the place” earlier in this verse. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use a direct or indirect quote here, and see what you did earlier in this verse.
26:7	fozc			עַל רִבְקָ֔ה	1	“because of Rebekah,” or “so that they could take/have Rebekah,”
26:7	b01d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי טוֹבַ֥ת מַרְאֶ֖ה הִֽיא	1	“because she {is/was} very/so beautiful.” For some languages it may be better to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Now Rebekah {was} very beautiful, so the men in that city started asking {Isaac} about her. Isaac was afraid they might kill him in order to take/have her, so he {lied and} told {them} she {was} his sister.” Do what is best in your language.

26:8	koto			וַ⁠יַּ֗רְא וְ⁠הִנֵּ֤ה	1	“and saw to his surprise” or “and was surprised to see”. In this context, “behold” means that King Abimelech was surprised at what he saw.
26:8	o4an			יִצְחָק֙ מְצַחֵ֔ק אֵ֖ת רִבְקָ֥ה אִשְׁתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“that Isaac was flirting with his wife Rebekah.” or “that Isaac was showing affection to his wife Rebekah.” There is a word play here in Hebrew (since “Isaac” and “laughing” come from the same root word). Isaac may have been laughing or flirting with Rebekah or physically touching her in an affectionate or intimate way, as a husband would do with his wife.
26:9	ziot			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֲבִימֶ֜לֶךְ לְ⁠יִצְחָ֗ק	1	“So/Then {King} Abimelech summoned Isaac” or “So/Then {King} Abimelech sent someone to bring Isaac to him”. King Abimelech probably sent a servant to tell Isaac to come talk to him.

It may be necessary to translate this in slightly different ways, depending on the context.
26:10	q591		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	וְ⁠הֵבֵאתָ֥ עָלֵ֖י⁠נוּ אָשָֽׁם	1	“and you would have caused us to be guilty {of adultery}!” or “with the result that you would have brought guilt/punishment on us!” The pronoun “us” in this verse refers to King Abimelech and the Philistines whom he ruled; it does not include Isaac.

Do what is best in your language.
26:12	okdv			וַ⁠יִּזְרַ֤ע יִצְחָק֙ בָּ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠הִ֔וא	1	“Isaac planted seeds/crops in that land/area,” The phrase “sow seeds” means to plant seeds by scattering them by hand on the ground in order to grow crops. If this method of planting is not known in your language area, you could translate this more generally and say, “planted seeds/crops” or “planted {large} fields {with seeds/crops}”.

26:14	uq3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠עֲבֻדָּ֖ה רַבָּ֑ה	1	“and {he also had/owned} many servants/slaves.” or “He also had/owned many servants/slaves.” The same Hebrew word is used for both “servant” or “slave”. Slaves and servants were owned by their masters but often they were treated as respected members of the family. An example of this was Abraham’s head servant who was sent to find a wife for Isaac (Gen 24). Keep this information in mind as you translate “servants” into your language.

26:20	opnl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עֵ֔שֶׂק	1	“Esek, {which means “dispute/argument,”}” If you include the meaning of this well’s name in your translation text or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translate “disputed” in the next clause. This word is different from the word for “quarreled” used earlier in verse 20, but it has the same meaning.
26:20	hywb			כִּ֥י הִֽתְעַשְּׂק֖וּ עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“because they argued with him {about it}.” or “because they disputed/argued with his herdsmen {about it}.” The herdsmen from Gerar disputed with Isaac indirectly (verse 20b) when they quarreled with his herdsmen (verse 20a). Make sure in your translation that the two halves of this verse do not contradict each other.

Some translations leave that information implied. Do what is best in your language.

Other languages prefer to put the reason before the result. Do what is best in your language.

Notice that in the first two alternate translations, the pronouns “us” and “we” exclude him, but in the third alternate, the pronoun “we” includes him.
26:28	o3r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	וְ⁠נִכְרְתָ֥ה בְרִ֖ית	1	“So {please} let us make/establish a {peace} treaty/agreement”. See how you translated “cut a covenant” in Gen 21:27, 32.

26:28	fcp0			עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	“with each other,”
26:29	x6xs			אִם תַּעֲשֵׂ֨ה עִמָּ֜⁠נוּ רָעָ֗ה	1	“that you will never harm us,” Verse 29 specifies the details of the covenant or treaty that they want Isaac to vow or promise.

26:30	ncvw			וַ⁠יֹּאכְל֖וּ וַ⁠יִּשְׁתּֽוּ	1	“and they {all} ate and drank {together}.” In your translation it should not sound like the feast was only for King Abimelech and his men; Isaac ate with them.
26:31	ovmw			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכִּ֣ימוּ בַ⁠בֹּ֔קֶר	1	“Early the next morning they got up”. See how you translated “got up early in the morning” in Gen 20:8; 21:14, 22:3.

27:8	w8zu			וְ⁠עַתָּ֥ה בְנִ֖⁠י	1	“So then, my son,” or “Now son,” See how you translated “So now” in verse 3. Also, make sure it is clear that Rebekah is no longer quoting Isaac’s words (whether directly or indirectly). If necessary, you could begin this verse with: “Rebekah continued,” or “Then Rebekah said {to Jacob},”
27:8	b2vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י	1	“listen to me” or “listen to what I’m saying”. See how you translated “my voice” in Gen 26:5.

27:12	kr4s			יְמֻשֵּׁ֨⁠נִי֙ אָבִ֔⁠י	1	“my father touches/feels my skin/arms”. If this sentence is translated as a statement, you could end it with a period or an exclamation point to show that Jacob is worried.

Some languages have a special verb form (such as “would”) to communicate this.
27:12	wq82			וְ⁠הֵבֵאתִ֥י עָלַ֛⁠י קְלָלָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א בְרָכָֽה	1	“Then I will/would cause myself to be cursed instead of blessed.” or “Then he will curse me instead of blessing me.”

Also, for some languages it is more natural to put an address like “my son” first in this quote. Do what is best in your language.

She probably gave him the clothes and asked him to put them on himself.

27:32	ag39			מִי אָ֑תָּה	1	“Which son {are} you?!” or “Which of my sons {are} you?!” Isaac knew from what Esau just said in verse 31 that one of his sons was talking to him.

Do what is most natural in your language. Also, in order to help readers understand why Esau said this about Jacob, some translations include a footnote like the following: The name “Jacob” means “heel-grabber” and can imply deception. He was given that name because when he was born, he was grabbing hold of Esau’s heel (Genesis 25:26).

Consider whether it is more natural in your language to end this sentence here or to continue the sentence into verse 45. Also, the phrase “turns away” is used here as an idiom that means “becomes less” or “goes away”.
27:45	s9be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַד שׁ֨וּב אַף אָחִ֜י⁠ךָ מִמְּ⁠ךָ֗	1	“until his anger against you is gone” or “When he is not angry with you anymore” or “After a while, when your brother is no longer angry with you”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, notice that the Hebrew word for “anger” here is different from the stronger word (“fury”) in verse 44.
27:45	r7r3			וְ⁠שָׁכַח֙ אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁר עָשִׂ֣יתָ לּ֔⁠וֹ	1	“and he forgets what you did to him” or “and he no longer thinks about what you did” or “and he doesn’t hold a grudge against you anymore”. Rebekah is not saying that Esau would totally forget what Jacob did, but that at some point he would not hold it against him anymore.
27:45	fq9m			וְ⁠שָׁלַחְתִּ֖י וּ⁠לְקַחְתִּ֣י⁠ךָ מִ⁠שָּׁ֑ם	1	“I will send word that it is safe for you to come {back home} from there.” or “I will send someone to tell you when/that it is safe to come back {home}.”
27:45	lv4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ⁠מָ֥ה אֶשְׁכַּ֛ל גַּם שְׁנֵי⁠כֶ֖ם י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד	1	“I do not want to lose both of you {on} the same day!” or “I do not want both my sons to be killed!” Rebekah knew that if Esau were to kill Jacob, he himself would have been killed for that crime. Consider whether it is best in your language to use a rhetorical question or an exclamation to emphasize Rebekah’s concern.
27:46	gusr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֤אמֶר רִבְקָה֙ אֶל יִצְחָ֔ק	1	“Then Rebekah complained to Isaac,” or “{Soon} after that, Rebekah said/complained to Isaac,”
27:46	wp91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	קַ֣צְתִּי בְ⁠חַיַּ֔⁠י	1	“My life is {very} miserable” or “I do not enjoy living” or “I am very upset”. Rebekah is exaggerating how she feels to influence Isaac to do what she wants.
27:46	oa6h			מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י בְּנ֣וֹת חֵ֑ת	1	“because of the Hittite women {whom Esau married}!” or “because of our Hittite daughters-in-law {whom Esau married}!” To show that Rebekah is speaking with strong emotion, you could use an exclamation point at the end of this sentence and the following one.
27:46	ahi7			אִם לֹקֵ֣חַ יַ֠עֲקֹב אִשָּׁ֨ה מִ⁠בְּנֽוֹת חֵ֤ת כָּ⁠אֵ֨לֶּה֙ מִ⁠בְּנ֣וֹת הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	“If Jacob {also} marries a Hittite woman from around here,” or “If Jacob were to {also} marry a local Hittite woman like that,”
27:46	avta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֥⁠מָּה לִּ֖⁠י חַיִּֽים	1	“my life will/would not be worth living!” or “I would not want to keep on living!” Rebekah uses a rhetorical question and hyperbole to emphasize how upset she would be if Jacob married a Hittite woman.
28:1	md9d			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א יִצְחָ֛ק אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	“So Isaac called/sent for Jacob {to come to him}” or “{Because of what Rebekah said,} Isaac summoned Jacob”
28:1	u0pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	“blessed him,” or “Then he blessed him” or “{When/After Jacob/he came,} Isaac blessed him”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, for some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that Jacob arrived. Do what is best in your language.

28:1	nbgz			לֹֽא־תִקַּ֥ח אִשָּׁ֖ה מִ⁠בְּנ֥וֹת כְּנָֽעַן	1	“Do not take/marry a woman who is a descendant of Canaan.” or “You must not take/choose a wife from among the Canaanite women.” or “Do not marry a Canaanite woman.” If the word “woman” is used here in your translation, make sure it refers to a virgin woman who has never been married, or is general enough to include that.
28:2	c1no		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ק֥וּם לֵךְ֙	1	“{Rather} get up/ready and go” or “{Instead} you must go right away”. See how you translated “get up” in Gen 27:43.

28:3	qw5u			וְ⁠אֵ֤ל שַׁדַּי֙ יְבָרֵ֣ךְ אֹֽתְ⁠ךָ֔	1	“I pray that Almighty God will bless/prosper you” or “I ask God, {who is} all-powerful, to bless/prosper you” or “I pray that God, {who is} all-powerful, will bless/prosper you”. Most translation teams translate the meaning of God’s title here (“God Almighty”). A few teams transliterate the title as “El Shaddai” as if it were a personal name (which it is not). See how you handled “God Almighty” in Gen 17:1.
28:3	fji8			וְ⁠יַפְרְ⁠ךָ֖	1	“and give you many children” or “and enable you to have many children”
28:3	cjdb			וְ⁠יַרְבֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	“and increase {the number of} your descendants” or “so that you have many descendants and”. See how you translated “fruitful and multiply” in Gen 17:20. It may need to be translated in different ways, depending on the context.
28:3	klxv			וְ⁠הָיִ֖יתָ לִ⁠קְהַ֥ל עַמִּֽים	1	“so that you become {the ancestor of} many people/ethnic groups.” or “so that many people/ethnic groups will descend/come from you.” or “so that they become many people/ethnic groups.”

28:4	pfi2			לְ⁠רִשְׁתְּ⁠ךָ֙ אֶת אֶ֣רֶץ	1	“so that you will own the/this land” or “so that you will take possession of the/this land”
28:4	vo59			מְגֻרֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“where you have been living/residing as a foreigner/outsider,” or “where you {and your ancestors} have been living as foreigners/outsiders,” See how you translated “land of your sojournings” in Gen 17:8; it may be necessary to translate this differently here because of the different context.
28:4	vgdh			אֲשֶׁר נָתַ֥ן אֱלֹהִ֖ים לְ⁠אַבְרָהָֽם	1	“{the same land} which God gave/promised to Abraham/him.”
28:5	mnq0			וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֤ח יִצְחָק֙ אֶֽת יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“Then Isaac sent Jacob {on his way},” or “Then Isaac said good-bye to Jacob,”
28:5	rx0u			וַ⁠יֵּ֖לֶךְ	1	“and he/Jacob left to go/travel” or “and/so Jacob started traveling”. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Jacob had already arrived at Paddan Aram.
28:5	awgp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	פַּדֶּ֣נָֽ⁠ה אֲרָ֑ם אֶל לָבָ֤ן	1	“to/toward {the land/region of} Paddan Aram, to Laban” or “to/toward {his uncle} Laban{’s house} {which was} in {the land/region of} Paddan Aram.” Consider whether is more natural in your language to refer to Paddan Aram first or to Laban first in this sentence. Also see how you translated “to Paddan Aram” in verses 2 and 5.
28:5	ftm9			בֶּן בְּתוּאֵל֙ הָֽ⁠אֲרַמִּ֔י	1	“{who/Laban was} the son of Bethuel the Aramean”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, be consistent with how you spelled the name “Bethuel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 22:22-23; 24:15, 24, 47, 50; 25:20; 28:2, 5.

Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated “commanded” in verse 1.
28:6	y1vo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	לֹֽא־תִקַּ֥ח אִשָּׁ֖ה מִ⁠בְּנ֥וֹת כְּנָֽעַן	1	“You must not take/marry a woman who is a descendant of Canaan,” or “that he must not take/choose a wife from among the Canaanite women,” or “to not marry a Canaanite woman,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to translate this direct quote as an indirect quote.
28:7	y4m1			וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֣ע יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“and {he also saw/observed that} Jacob” or “{Esau also saw/noticed that} Jacob”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
28:7	j3n2			וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֣ע אֶל אָבִ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠אֶל אִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“obeyed his/their father and mother” or “obeyed his/their parents”

28:8	krg7			רָע֖וֹת בְּנ֣וֹת כְּנָ֑עַן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֖י יִצְחָ֥ק אָבִֽי⁠ו	1	“his father Isaac did not approve of {his sons marrying} Canaanite women.” or “his father Isaac did not want {his sons to marry} Canaanite women.”
28:9	nd2l			וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ עֵשָׂ֖ו אֶל יִשְׁמָעֵ֑אל	1	“So/Then Esau went/traveled to {the family/clan of} Ishmael” or “So/Then Esau went to {the region where} Ishmael’s descendants were living”. Most likely Ishmael was already dead by this time, so that Esau went to the region where Ishmael’s children and other descendants were living.
28:9	xyag			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֡ח אֶֽת מָחֲלַ֣ת בַּת יִשְׁמָעֵ֨אל בֶּן אַבְרָהָ֜ם & לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	“and married Abraham’s granddaughter Mahalath, who was Ishmael’s daughter” or “and married Mahalath, who was the daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael”
28:9	vycn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֲח֧וֹת נְבָי֛וֹת	1	“and {who was} the {younger} sister of Nebaioth,” or “and whose {older} brother was Nebaioth,” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Nebaioth” in Gen 25:13. Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child, Mahalath was his younger sister, probably from the same mother. Use a kinship term here in your language for “sister” or “brother” that fits with those facts.
28:9	g3ii		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל נָשָׁ֖י⁠ו ל֥⁠וֹ	1	“besides the {two} wives he already had.” For some languages it may be better to change the order of some of the clauses in this sentence and say, “So, in addition to the {two} wives he already had, Esau went to {the family of} Abraham’s son Ishmael and married Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath, whose brother was Nebaioth.” Do what is best in your language.
28:10	n0gq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֥א יַעֲקֹ֖ב מִ⁠בְּאֵ֣ר שָׁ֑בַע וַ⁠יֵּ֖לֶךְ	1	“{After} Jacob left from {his family’s home in} {the city of} Beersheba, he started traveling” or “{Meanwhile} Jacob had left {the city of} Beersheba and was traveling”. Verse 10 refers back to verse 5, where Jacob had left his parents’ home in Beersheba to go to Paddan Aram. Make sure your translation does not sound like he left a second time here in verse 10.
28:10	ctw0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חָרָֽנָ⁠ה	1	“to/toward {the city of} Haran {in the region/land of Paddan Aram}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob was heading toward the same place that his father had told him to go to in verse 2. The author assumed here that his audience knew that Haran was a city located in the Paddan Aram region. It may be helpful to include a map in your translation that shows the locations of the city of Haran and the region of Paddan Aram.
28:11	bo89			וַ⁠יִּפְגַּ֨ע בַּ⁠מָּק֜וֹם וַ⁠יָּ֤לֶן שָׁם֙	1	“{That evening} he reached a {good} place {to camp/sleep}, so he stayed/spent the night there” or “{Late that evening} he came to a place where he stopped/stayed {for the night}”
28:11	opfz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּי בָ֣א הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1	“because the sun had gone {down}.” or “because the sun had set.” For some languages it is more natural to put the information in this clause first in this sentence and say, “After the sun went down, he reached a good place {to camp/sleep}, so he stopped/stayed there {for the night}.” Do what is best in your language.
28:11	lmbe			וַ⁠יִּקַּח֙ מֵ⁠אַבְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם	1	“He chose {one} of the stones that was there” or “He picked out a large {flat} stone {that he found} there”. The way you translate “stone” should refer to something that would be large enough to support Jacob’s head, but not so large that it would be too heavy for him to lift. For example in English, a pebble is too small and a boulder is too big.
28:11	nd10			וַ⁠יָּ֖שֶׂם מְרַֽאֲשֹׁתָ֑י⁠ו	1	“and rested his head on it {as a headrest/pillow},” or “and used it as a headrest/pillow,” or “to use as a headrest/pillow,”
28:11	l8b0			וַ⁠יִּשְׁכַּ֖ב בַּ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠הֽוּא	1	“then he lay down there {and went to sleep}.” or “Then he lay down there {on the ground} {and went to sleep}.” or “then he went to sleep there.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
28:12	ph5p			וַֽ⁠יַּחֲלֹ֗ם	1	“And {as} he dreamed,” or “{As/While he slept,} he had a dream and” or “While he was dreaming,”

The bottom/base of the stairway was/rested on the ground”. This stairway was wide enough for there to be angels moving up and down on it at the same time.
28:12	lw00			וְ⁠רֹאשׁ֖⁠וֹ מַגִּ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יְמָ⁠ה	1	“and its top reached up to heaven,” or “and the top of it went/reached {all the way} up into the heavens/sky,”

28:13	imw1			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה יְהוָ֜ה נִצָּ֣ב עָלָי⁠ו֮	1	“Then suddenly Yahweh was standing at the top {of the stairway},” or “And there standing at the top {of the stairway} was Yahweh,” or “And Yahweh was {also} there, standing at the top {of the stairway}”. The phrase for “above it” in the Hebrew text is ambiguous. It could mean: (1) “above it” or “at the top {of the stairway}” or (2) “above/beside him/Jacob”. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.
28:13	n9f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַר֒ אֲנִ֣י יְהוָ֗ה	1	“and he/Yahweh said {to him/Jacob}, “I {am} Yahweh,”

28:13	xkui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֤ר אַתָּה֙ שֹׁכֵ֣ב עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ לְ⁠ךָ֥ אֶתְּנֶ֖⁠נָּה וּ⁠לְ⁠זַרְעֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	“The/This land where you are lying/sleeping I am giving to you and your descendants.” or “I will give you and your descendants this land that you are lying/sleeping on.” In the Hebrew text, “the land that you are lying on” comes first in this sentence in order to emphasize it and show its importance. Do what is natural in your language.
28:14	qvmn			וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֙	1	“And your descendants will be” or “They will be” or “You will have so many descendants that they will be”

28:14	fyzl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠פָרַצְתָּ֛	1	“and your descendants/people will spread out” or “so that they expand {their territory}” or “so that they live throughout this land”. In this clause “you” refers to Jacob’s descendants. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
28:14	y8nb			יָ֥מָּ⁠ה וָ⁠קֵ֖דְמָ⁠ה וְ⁠צָפֹ֣נָ⁠ה וָ⁠נֶ֑גְבָּ⁠ה	1	“to the west, east, north, and south.” or “to the north, south, east, and west.” or “in every direction.” See how you translated the names of the directions “west,” “east,” “north,” and “south” in Gen 13:14. Notice that they are in a different order there.
28:14	b4q4			בְ⁠ךָ֛ & וּ⁠בְ⁠זַרְעֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	“In/Through you and your offspring/descendants” or “Because of you and your offspring/descendants” or “By means of you and your offspring/descendants”. Be consistent here with how you translated “your offspring” in Gen 22:18 and 26:4.
28:14	wjvf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִבְרֲכ֥וּ & כָּל מִשְׁפְּחֹ֥ת הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה	1	“all the families/people on the earth will be blessed {by me}.” or “{I} will bless all the families/clans/people in the world.” For some languages it may be better to change the order of phrases in this sentence and say, “And {I} will bless all the families in the world through you and your offspring/descendants.” or “I will use you and your offspring/descendants to bless all the families on earth.” See how you translated similar Messianic blessings in Gen 12:3, 18:18, 22:18, and 26:4.
28:15	spzs			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	“Listen to this:” or “Remember that”
28:15	dpan			אָנֹכִ֜י עִמָּ֗⁠ךְ	1	“I {will always be/stay} with you.” or “I {promise to always be/stay} with you {and help you}.” See how you translated “I {am} with you” in Gen 26:24 and “I will be with you” in Gen 26:3.
28:15	d0fg			וּ⁠שְׁמַרְתִּ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	“I will protect/guard you” or “I will take care of you”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Rather the focus is on the period of time between now when God is speaking to Jacob and the time later on when Jacob would see the fulfillment of God’s promises to him.

28:17	gktr			מַה נּוֹרָ֖א הַ⁠מָּק֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	“This is an awesome/terrifying place!” or “This place is terrifying!” The word “awesome” refers here to the terror that Jacob was feeling from being in the holy presence of Almighty God.
28:17	bjri			אֵ֣ין זֶ֗ה כִּ֚י אִם בֵּ֣ית אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“This/It can only be God’s house!” or “This/It must be the house/place where God himself lives!”

28:18	m9zc			מַצֵּבָ֑ה	1	“{as} a monument/marker,” or “{as} a memorial stone,” or “to commemorate/mark the/that place {where God had appeared to him}.” The word “pillar” refers here to a stone that is used to commemorate something. In this case, Jacob used a stone to mark and help him remember the place where God had appeared to him.
28:18	rd51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּצֹ֥ק שֶׁ֖מֶן עַל רֹאשָֽׁ⁠הּ	1	“Then he poured {some} {olive} oil on top of the stone/pillar {to dedicate the place to God}.” In Bible times people poured olive oil on a person’s head or on objects (as here) to dedicate that person or object to God. Make sure that the way you translate “oil” does not refer to motor oil. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
28:19	p2h7			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֛א אֶת שֵֽׁם הַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא בֵּֽית אֵ֑ל	1	“He named that place Bethel, {which means “God’s house,”}” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Bethel” in Gen 12:8 and 13:3.
28:19	a944			וְ⁠אוּלָ֛ם ל֥וּז שֵׁם הָ⁠עִ֖יר לָ⁠רִאשֹׁנָֽה	1	“even though originally/previously that town was named/called Luz.” or “Originally/Previously the name of that town {had been} Luz.” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.
28:20	rcyf			וַ⁠יִּדַּ֥ר יַעֲקֹ֖ב נֶ֣דֶר לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“Then Jacob/he made a vow/pledge/promise {to God} and said,” See how you translated a clause that has a similar meaning (“swear to …”) in Gen 21:23, 31.
28:20	rony		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אִם יִהְיֶ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים עִמָּדִ֗⁠י	1	“God, if {you} will be/stay with me”. Since Jacob is making this vow to God, for some languages it is more natural to address God directly (as “you”) throughout verses 20-22, rather than only in the last half of verse 22 (as the Hebrew text does). Do what is best in your language.
28:20	lyjc			וּ⁠שְׁמָרַ֨⁠נִי֙	1	“and protect/guard me” or “and take care of me”. See how you translated “watch over” in verse 15.
28:20	dopf			בַּ⁠דֶּ֤רֶךְ הַ⁠זֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָנֹכִ֣י הוֹלֵ֔ךְ	1	“on/during this {long} journey I am taking” or “as I travel on this {long} journey”. The way you translate this phrase should reflect that fact that Jacob’s journey from his home to the city of Haran was about 725 kilometers (450 miles) long.
28:20	gftj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠נָֽתַן לִ֥⁠י לֶ֛חֶם לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֖ל וּ⁠בֶ֥גֶד לִ⁠לְבֹּֽשׁ	1	“and if you give/provide me food to eat and clothes to wear,” or “and if you provide me with food and clothes,” In this context “bread” refers to food in general, not just bread.
28:21	riwh			וְ⁠שַׁבְתִּ֥י בְ⁠שָׁל֖וֹם	1	“and {if} I come back safely” or “so that I return safely”
28:21	jfhz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶל בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑⁠י	1	“to my father’s/family’s home,” or “to my family,” This phrase especially refers to Jacob's father's family members, not just the physical home.
28:21	yyp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠הָיָ֧ה יְהוָ֛ה לִ֖⁠י לֵ⁠אלֹהִֽים	1	“then Yahweh, {you} will be the God whom I serve/worship,” or “then I will serve/worship {you} Yahweh as my God,”

Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Also see how you translated “tithe” in Gen 14:20.
29:1	v7y6			וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֥א יַעֲקֹ֖ב רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו וַ⁠יֵּ֖לֶךְ	1	“Then Jacob left {Bethel} and continued traveling {until he came}” or “Then Jacob continued traveling until he came”
29:1	wri0			אַ֥רְצָ⁠ה בְנֵי קֶֽדֶם	1	“to the land in the east where various people/ethnic groups lived.” or “to the land/region that was east {of the land of Canaan} where the eastern people/ethnic groups lived.” This land was located east of the land of Canaan and included the region of Paddan Aram where Jacob’s uncle Laban lived in the city of Haran (Gen 27:43; 28:5). See how you translated “east” in Gen 28:14.
29:2	ox8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֞רְא	1	“Then he looked {around},” or “{When he arrived/got there,} he looked {around},” or “{When he arrived at a place near the city of Haran,} he looked {around},” Jacob was now near the city of Haran (verse 4), which was in the land east of Canaan (verse 1).
29:2	xzs6			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֧ה בְאֵ֣ר בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה	1	“and he saw a well in an {open} field/area” or “and there in an {open} field/area {was} a well”. The word “field” refers to an open area of land, not a fenced-in area. See how you translated this term in Gen 25:27, 29.
29:2	f5dt			וְ⁠הִנֵּה שָׁ֞ם שְׁלֹשָׁ֤ה עֶדְרֵי צֹאן֙ רֹבְצִ֣ים	1	“He saw three flocks of sheep that were lying {down}” or “There were three flocks of sheep lying {down}”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
29:2	rel5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	“beside it,” or “near/beside the well {waiting for water},”

29:2	nge7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠הָ⁠אֶ֥בֶן גְּדֹלָ֖ה עַל פִּ֥י הַ⁠בְּאֵֽר	1	“but the stone covering the opening/top of the well {was} large {and heavy}.” or “but there was a {heavy} large stone over/covering the opening/top of the well.” This stone would have been very large and heavy and probably had been cut into a circular shape to cover the round opening of the well. You could include here in your translation a picture of a well with a round, flat stone covering it.
29:3	zip2			וְ⁠נֶאֶסְפוּ שָׁ֣מָּ⁠ה כָל הָ⁠עֲדָרִ֗ים וְ⁠גָלֲל֤וּ אֶת־הָ⁠אֶ֨בֶן֙	1	“{Every day} shepherds would bring all the/their flocks {of sheep} there. They would {work together to} roll/take the stone” or “{Whenever/After} all the shepherds brought their flocks there, {together} they would remove the stone”. Verse 3 tells what happened regularly every day. Consider what is the best way to communicate this in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “stone” in verse 2.
29:3	ehgo			מֵ⁠עַל֙ פִּ֣י הַ⁠בְּאֵ֔ר	1	“from/off the opening/top of the well”
29:3	nplo			וְ⁠הִשְׁק֖וּ אֶת הַ⁠צֹּ֑אן	1	“and draw water for the sheep.” or “and get water {from it} for the sheep {to drink}.” See how you translated “watered” in verse 2, and how you translated a different word that has a similar meaning (“draw water”) in Gen 24:19-20.
29:3	kxfp			וְ⁠הֵשִׁ֧יבוּ אֶת הָ⁠אֶ֛בֶן & לִ⁠מְקֹמָֽ⁠הּ	1	“Then they would put/roll/position the stone back”

29:4	ipz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַחַ֖⁠י	1	“My friends,” or “Friends,” This is a polite, friendly idiom used as a greeting; it does not mean that the shepherds were actually Jacob’s relatives. Many languages have a similar greeting.
29:4	bckj			מֵ⁠אַ֣יִן אַתֶּ֑ם	1	“where do you live?”
29:4	rgvw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ	1	“They replied {to him},” or “They answered {him},”
29:4	ooyz			מֵ⁠חָרָ֖ן אֲנָֽחְנוּ	1	“We {are} from {the city of} Haran.” or “We live in {the city of} Haran.” Your translation should not sound like the city of Haran was far away from there; it was nearby.
29:5	mz8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	“So Jacob asked them,” or “So Jacob asked,” Consider what is the most natural way in your language to translate quote margins in a conversation that goes back and forth quickly like the one in verses 4-8. After the conversation gets started, it often sounds more life-like and natural to shorten the quote margins and leave implied some of the references to the people who are being talked to (as long as it is still clear who is talking to whom).
29:5	jju9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הַ⁠יְדַעְתֶּ֖ם אֶת לָבָ֣ן בֶּן נָח֑וֹר	1	“Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?” or “Do you know Nahor’s grandson Laban?” Consider what is the best way to order this question in your language.
29:5	qynl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֖וּ	1	“They answered/replied,”
29:5	o8s7			יָדָֽעְנוּ	1	“{Yes,} we know him.” or “{Yes,} we do.” Hebrew does not have a single word for “Yes”, but rather repeats words from what was asked. Do what is natural in your language.
29:6	oat9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֖ם	1	“Then/So Jacob asked,”
29:6	wjxw			הֲ⁠שָׁל֣וֹם ל֑⁠וֹ	1	“Are {things} going well for him?” or “Is he doing well?” Jacob is asking about Laban’s general well-being, not just his health.
29:6	gj3q			וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ	1	“They answered {him},”
29:6	cq6m			שָׁל֔וֹם	1	“{Yes,} {things are} well/good {for him}.” or “{Yes,} {he is} well.”

29:7	s198		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“Then Jacob said {to them},” or “Then Jacob urged {them},”
29:7	qywf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הֵ֥ן עוֹד֙ הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם גָּד֔וֹל	1	“Look, it is still the middle of the day” or “Look, the sun is still high/bright {in the sky}” or “There is still a lot of daylight/sunlight left”. This is an idiom that means there are still many more hours of daytime left. Consider whether your language has an idiom for this.
29:7	hpgk			לֹא עֵ֖ת הֵאָסֵ֣ף הַ⁠מִּקְנֶ֑ה	1	“and/so {it is} too early/soon to gather the livestock/flocks {for the night}.”

For some languages it sounds too rude for Jacob to make a direct command here, so it is better to make this a suggestion or even a rhetorical question. Do what is best in your language.
29:7	agiz			וּ⁠לְכ֥וּ רְעֽוּ	1	“and/then take {them} {back} out {to the fields} to graze {some more}.” or “then you can take them out to eat {more} grass.”

Make sure it is clear in your translation that the ones who are talking here are also shepherds. See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.” Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
29:8	rng7			מֵ⁠עַ֖ל פִּ֣י הַ⁠בְּאֵ֑ר	1	“off/from the opening/top of the well” See how you translated this phrase in verses 2 and 3.

In that culture it was common to greet a relative with a kiss on the cheek (or both cheeks). However, if it would be offensive in your culture for Jacob to kiss Rachel here, you could translate this more generally (See: the second alternate translation above). Also see how you translated “kiss” in Gen 27:26-27.
29:11	lylh			וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֥א אֶת קֹל֖⁠וֹ וַ⁠יֵּֽבְךְּ	1	“and he started crying aloud/loudly {because he was so happy}.” or “and {he was so happy that} he started crying.” See how you translated the idiom “lifted his voice” in Gen 27:38. However, here Jacob is crying because he is happy, not upset. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
29:12	ctrv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֨ד יַעֲקֹ֜ב לְ⁠רָחֵ֗ל	1	“Then he told her”. Consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to Jacob and Rachel in this context.

This rhetorical question expects the implied answer “No, of course not!” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a statement here instead.

29:17	chl6			וְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י לֵאָ֖ה רַכּ֑וֹת	1	“Leah’s eyes {were} delicate/pretty/weak,” or “Leah had pretty eyes,” The Hebrew word for “delicate” is ambiguous in this context. It can have: (1) a positive meaning of “pretty” or “lovely” or (2) a negative meaning of “weak”, which implies that Leah’s eyes were plain, dull, or unattractive.

29:21	n2l9			וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֤ב אֶל לָבָן֙	1	“{When the seven years were over,} Jacob said to Laban,” or “After that, Jacob requested of Laban,”

Also make sure that Jacob’s request here sounds polite in your translation, not rude or demanding. It should also not sound like he was begging or pleading.

29:23	r0w3			וַ⁠יְהִ֣י בָ⁠עֶ֔רֶב	1	“But that evening” or “But/However this is what happened that evening:”
29:23	vaw0			וַ⁠יִּקַּח֙ אֶת לֵאָ֣ה בִתּ֔⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּבֵ֥א אֹתָ֖⁠הּ אֵלָ֑י⁠ו	1	“Laban {deceived/tricked Jacob and} took/brought his daughter Leah {to Jacob’s tent} {instead of Rachel},” or “Laban took/brought Leah to Jacob {instead of Rachel},”
29:23	n4dv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א	1	“and/so he/Jacob” or “so that he/Jacob”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that “he” refers here to Jacob, not Laban.
29:23	h5xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א אֵלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	“so that he/Jacob had marital/sexual relations with her/Leah.” or “and/so he/Jacob slept with her/Leah.” or “spent the night with her/Leah.” Make sure that your translation of “he” refers here to Jacob, not Laban. See how you translated the euphemism “went to” in Gen 16:4 (and “go to” in Gen 16:2 and 29:21). Translate this in a way that is natural, clear, and acceptable for reading in public.
29:24	zehs			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֤ן לָבָן֙	1	“Laban also gave” or “In addition, Laban gave”. It is not clear in the Hebrew text when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah, so it is probably best to keep it that way in your translation. Some translations say that Laban “had {already} given” Zilpah to Leah before the wedding night. However according to Jewish history (outside the Bible), it was on the wedding night that Laban did this as part of his plan to deceive Jacob: Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, so everyone would expect her to be given to Rachel as the younger sister; seeing Zilpah (instead of Bilhah) would help Jacob think that his veiled bride was Rachel. Since we do not know for sure which interpretation is right, it is probably best to be like the Hebrew text and not specify when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah. Some translations put this verse in parentheses because it seems to interrupt the telling of the main events.
29:24	wz5d			לָ֔⁠הּ אֶת זִלְפָּ֖ה שִׁפְחָת֑⁠וֹ לְ⁠לֵאָ֥ה בִתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	“his female servant Zilpah to Leah” or “to Leah a female servant named Zilpah”

29:25	wt9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הִנֵּה הִ֖וא לֵאָ֑ה	1	“{Jacob} saw/found that his {new} wife was Leah!” or “{Jacob was shocked to} see/discover that it was Leah {he had married}!” Translate “behold” in a way that shows Jacob’s surprise at finding out that he had married Leah instead of Rachel. Also, make sure that your translation of “she” refers here to Leah, not Zilpah (who was mentioned in verse 24).
29:25	qd1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל לָבָ֗ן	1	“So/Then he/Jacob complained to {his father-in-law} Laban,” or “So/Then he/Jacob rebuked/confronted Laban and said,” Some languages use an honorific title such as “his father-in-law” here now that Jacob is married. Do what is best in your language.
29:25	n8tv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה זֹּאת֙ עָשִׂ֣יתָ לִּ֔⁠י	1	“Why have you treated me like this?” or “You have treated me very badly!” In this verse, Jacob uses rhetorical questions to communicate how angry and upset he is. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Also see how you translated this question in Gen 12:18, 20:9, 26:10.
29:25	sxpf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֤א בְ⁠רָחֵל֙ עָבַ֣דְתִּי עִמָּ֔⁠ךְ	1	“{You know that} Rachel is the one I served you for!” or “You know very well that I worked for you in order to marry Rachel!”

For some languages it is necessary to say what the custom is, rather than what it is not. For example, you could say, “Our custom/practice here is to wait until the firstborn/oldest daughter is married before we let the younger daughter{s}/one{s} get married.” Do what is best in your language.

Only make this information explicit if it is necessary to avoid wrong meaning.
29:27	w292			וְ⁠נִתְּנָ֨ה לְ⁠ךָ֜ גַּם אֶת זֹ֗את	1	“Then our family will also give you {my} other/younger daughter {to marry}” or “Then you may also marry {my} other/younger daughter”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

30:1	dvs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	מֵתָ֥ה אָנֹֽכִי	1	“I want to die!” or “I have no reason to live!” Rachel is using hyperbole (exaggeration) to show how desperate and deeply ashamed she feels about not having children. You could include a footnote here in your translation that explains how in that culture it was considered very shameful for a woman to be barren (See: Gen 30:23).
30:2	ca4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר אַ֥ף יַעֲקֹ֖ב בְּ⁠רָחֵ֑ל וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“Jacob’s anger flared up against Rachel, and/so he said/responded {to her},” or “Jacob became very angry with Rachel and said/responded,” Some languages have an idiom that is similar to the Hebrew idiom here.

It may come from the custom of immediately putting a newborn child on the lap of the father and mother to symbolize that the child belonged to them.
30:3	ezdx			וְ⁠אִבָּנֶ֥ה גַם אָנֹכִ֖י מִמֶּֽ⁠נָּה	1	“so that from/through her {children} I too can/will build/have a family.” or “so that I too can/will build/have a family.” See how you translated “built up from her” in Gen 16:2.

Also see how you translated a different word (“servant woman”) in verse 3 that has the same meaning. Some translations use the same term in both verses to prevent confusion. Do what is best in your language.
30:4	vgw7			לְ⁠אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	“as {his} wife,” or “to be {a/another} wife {for him},” Make sure your translation does not sound like Bilhah replaced Rachel as Jacob’s wife; Bilhah was an additional wife.

30:6	uc2m			דָּנַ֣⁠נִּי אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“God has judged in my favor!” Some translations have “judged me” here. However, make sure your translation of this phrase has a positive meaning (making a decision in Rachel’s favor) and not a negative meaning (condemning her).
30:6	c8tv			וְ⁠גַם֙ שָׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹלִ֔⁠י וַ⁠יִּתֶּן לִ֖⁠י בֵּ֑ן	1	“Yes indeed, he has heard/answered my prayer/request/plea and given me a son!”

30:6	kpso			קָרְאָ֥ה שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	“she called/named him” or “she gave him the name” or “she named her baby/son”. Make sure it is clear here in your translation that Bilhah’s son is the one being named, not God (who was the subject of the previous sentence). See how you translated “called his name” in Gen 29:32.
30:6	cf1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	דָּֽן	1	“Dan, {which means “he vindicated.”}” or “Dan, {which means “he judged in my favor.”}” If you include the meaning of Dan’s name in your translation (or in a footnote), make sure it matches the way you translated “he has vindicated” earlier in this verse.

30:8	fope			נַפְתּוּלֵ֨י אֱלֹהִ֧ים נִפְתַּ֛לְתִּי עִם אֲחֹתִ֖⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “I have had a mighty/difficult struggle/contest with my sister” or “I have struggled intensely/hard with/against my sister”. That would be the meaning if the Hebrew word “elohim” in this phrase is used as an adjective that means “mighty/powerful.” (2) “I have wrestled/struggled with God because of my sister”, which could refer to a struggle against her sister praying to God for children. That would be the meaning if the word “elohim” in this phrase means “God.”

30:13	jwvp			בְּ⁠אָשְׁרִ֕⁠י	1	“I am truly/greatly blessed!” or “{God} has truly/greatly blessed me!” Although many translations have “happy” in this verse instead of “blessed,” the Hebrew noun (and the verb it is based on) is more general and has to do with a person’s blessed state (which results in joy and happiness). The same Hebrew word is used in Psalm 1:1, and the equivalent Greek word is used in Luke 1:48 and Matthew 5:3-11.

Consider whether or not rhetorical questions are the best way to communicate that in your language.

30:24	ogv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“{because} she said,” For some languages it is more natural to put the last half of verse 24 first in the verse and say, “She also said, “May Yahweh add/give another son to me.” So she named that/her son Joseph, {which means “may he add/give another.”}” Do what is best in your language.

30:27	hsr3			נִחַ֕שְׁתִּי	1	“{because} I have found out from observing signs” or “{because} I have learned from observation/experience”. The word “divination” refers to trying to find out information by looking at signs (omens) and interpreting them either by God’s power (Gen 44:5, 15) or by witchcraft and false gods (Ezekiel 21:21). Laban may have consulted his household gods (mentioned in Gen 31:19, 30). It could also be that Laban meant that he had figured this out simply by observing how God had blessed him through Jacob’s expert tending of his flocks.

30:28	b7cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	“Then he said {to him,}” or “Then he/Laban added,” Some translations delete this quote margin, since the same person is still speaking to the same person as in the previous verse. However it could be that there was a pause in the conversation, or the author may want to show that there is a change in topic or emphasize what is said next. So if possible, it is best to keep the quote margin here in your translation.

In that part of the world, most sheep were white and most goats were solid brown or black. So Jacob was asking for the irregular animals for himself, including white sheep with dark marks, dark-colored goats with light marks and dark-colored lambs. You could put some of this information in a footnote.

Make sure your translation of “he” in this clause refers to Laban, not Jacob (as verse 36 confirms). Also, what Laban does in verse 35 does not follow the agreement he just made with Jacob in verses 32-34.

30:35	fnxm			כֹּ֤ל אֲשֶׁר לָבָן֙ בּ֔⁠וֹ	1	“any/all that {had any} white {marks} on them,” The goats were normally dark brown or black, so if they had streaks or spots on them those marks would be white. In the Hebrew text, there is a pun (play-on-words) in verses 35 and 37: the name “Laban” means “white”, so verse 35 literally says that any goats with “Laban” (“white”) on them became Jacob’s. You could include that information in a footnote.

Do what is best in your language.
30:39	u4ep			וַ⁠יֶּחֱמ֥וּ הַ⁠צֹּ֖אן אֶל הַ⁠מַּקְל֑וֹת	1	“and/so they would mate in front of the branches,” or “they would mate where they could see the branches,” or “they would see the branches as they were mating/breeding,” Make sure your translation of the verbs in this verse refers to a repeated or habitual activity, not a one-time event.

See how you translated “speckled” and “spotted” in verses 32-33 and 35. Also consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the flocks in verses 38 and 39.

30:40	m70y			עָקֹ֛ד וְ⁠כָל ח֖וּם	1	“all the streaked/striped animals and dark-colored {animals}”. See how you translated “streaked” in verses 35 and 39, and how you translated “dark-colored” in verses 32-33 and 35.

30:40	hpgv			וַ⁠יָּֽשֶׁת ל֤⁠וֹ עֲדָרִים֙ לְ⁠בַדּ֔⁠וֹ	1	“In that way, {over time} he created/formed/made separate flocks {of sheep and goats} for himself”

Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that fits well here.

The term “livestock” usually includes all kinds of domestic animals, but in this context it refers to the sheep and goats that Jacob was taking care of for Laban.

The word “behold” emphasizes what Jacob saw and might also express that he was surprised at what he saw.
31:10	un5t			הָֽ⁠עַתֻּדִים֙ הָ⁠עֹלִ֣ים עַל הַ⁠צֹּ֔אן	1	“the {only} male goats {and sheep} that were mating with the female goats {and sheep}”. Some languages have special terms for male and female goats or sheep. For example, billy goats and nanny goats (for male and female goats) and rams and ewes (for male and female sheep). Choose terms in your language that are natural and well-known.

Sometimes an angel says “I” as God’s representative, but in this context, it seems to be Yahweh himself (in the form of an angel) who is speaking to Jacob (See verse 13). That information could be put in a footnote, and you could make “Yahweh” explicit in the text to make that clear.

31:13	mbfn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-term	אֲשֶׁ֨ר נָדַ֥רְתָּ לִּ֛⁠י שָׁ֖ם נֶ֑דֶר	1	“{and} where you made a vow/pledge/promise to me.” See how you translated “vowed a vow” in Gen 28:20.
31:13	tfiv			עַתָּ֗ה ק֥וּם צֵא֙ מִן הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֔את	1	“{So} now/then, get up/ready and leave this land/region {immediately},” or “Now go/leave at once from this land/region,” The phrase “get up” means that Jacob should immediately get ready to go and then leave; see how you translated this phrase in Gen 27:43.
31:13	pbq6			וְ⁠שׁ֖וּב אֶל	1	“and go/travel back to”
31:13	l0op			אֶ֥רֶץ מוֹלַדְתֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	“the land where you were born.” or “the land where your relatives live.” or “your native/home land.” The Hebrew word for “birth” in this phrase can also be translated as “relatives” here (as in verse 3). See how you translated this phrase in Gen 24:7.
31:14	rws1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תַּ֤עַן רָחֵל֙ וְ⁠לֵאָ֔ה וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֖רְנָה ל֑⁠וֹ	1	“Then Rachel and Leah responded to him/Jacob,” or “Rachel and Leah replied to him/Jacob,”
31:14	vutc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠ע֥וֹד לָ֛⁠נוּ חֵ֥לֶק וְ⁠נַחֲלָ֖ה	1	“We no longer have any part/share in the inheritance” or “We will not/never inherit anything”. This rhetorical question expects the answer “no.” It also expresses Rachel's and Leah’s strong emotion and emphasizes that there is nothing for them to inherit from their father. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question fits well here in your language.
31:14	cwr2			בְּ⁠בֵ֥ית אָבִֽי⁠נוּ	1	“from our father’s house/estate {when he dies}!” or “from our father {when he dies}”
31:15	pz13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֧וֹא & נֶחְשַׁ֥בְנוּ ל֖⁠וֹ	1	“Doesn’t he regard/treat us” or “It is obvious that he regards/treats us” or “He obviously is treating us”. This rhetorical question expects the answer “yes” and expresses Rachel's and Leah’s anger at how their father treats them. Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a rhetorical question here.
31:15	zdnp			נָכְרִיּ֛וֹת	1	“like foreigners/strangers/outsiders {and not family}” or “as if we were foreigners/strangers {instead of family}”. Make sure that the punctuation you use here fits with how you translate this rhetorical question.
31:15	xc1g			כִּ֣י מְכָרָ֑⁠נוּ	1	“For example, he sold us {to you},” or “After all, he sold us {to you},” This sentence is an example of how Laban treated his daughters like foreigners.
31:15	eovg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אכַל גַּם אָכ֖וֹל	1	“and then he spent all” or “and then he used up all”. The phrase “eaten up” is used here as an idiom that means Laban had spent or kept for himself all the wealth he had gained from Jacob’s 14 years of working for him. Many languages have a similar idiom that could be used here. Do what is best in your language.
31:15	td0t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת כַּסְפֵּֽ⁠נוּ	1	“the money/wealth that should have been ours.” or “the money/wealth that belonged to us.” In that culture at that time, silver was a currency used to buy and sell things.
31:16	cytc			כִּ֣י כָל הָ⁠עֹ֗שֶׁר אֲשֶׁ֨ר הִצִּ֤יל אֱלֹהִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אָבִ֔י⁠נוּ	1	“In fact, all the wealth/abundance {of flocks} that God has taken from our father” or “In fact/reality, all {the flocks} that made our father wealthy and that God has taken from him”
31:16	kbdk			לָ֥⁠נוּ ה֖וּא וּ⁠לְ⁠בָנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	“{rightfully/actually} {belongs} to us and our children.” or “{should have been given} to us and our children {anyway}.”
31:16	t00q			וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה עֲשֵֽׂה	1	“So then, {you should} do” or “So {go ahead and} do” or “So {we totally agree that you should} do”. The words “So now” introduce Rachel and Leah’s conclusion that is based on what they just said. Do what is best in your language to communicate that.
31:16	ixfc			כֹּל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אָמַ֧ר אֱלֹהִ֛ים אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	“everything/whatever God has told/commanded you {to do}.” or “exactly what God told/instructed you {to do}.”
31:17	jyen			וַ⁠יָּ֖קָם יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	“So/Then Jacob {immediately/quickly} got ready/packed {for the journey}”. See how you translated “get up” in verse 13.

31:18	wyn3			וַ⁠יִּנְהַ֣ג	1	“Then he led/herded” or “Then he {started} driving/leading/herding”
31:18	u8ps			אֶת כָּל מִקְנֵ֗⁠הוּ וְ⁠אֶת כָּל רְכֻשׁ⁠וֹ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָכָ֔שׁ מִקְנֵה֙ קִנְיָנ֔⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר רָכַ֖שׁ	1	“{the camels and} all his {other} livestock/animals and {along with them,} {he also took} all the {other} possessions that he had acquired/accumulated”. The word “livestock” is general here and includes all of Jacob’s animals.
31:18	ci2u			בְּ⁠פַדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם	1	“{while living} in {the land/region of} Paddan Aram,” Be consistent here with how you translated “{the land/region of} Paddan Aram” in Gen 25:20.
31:18	wde1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לָ⁠ב֛וֹא אֶל יִצְחָ֥ק אָבִ֖י⁠ו אַ֥רְצָ⁠ה כְּנָֽעַן	1	“to go/return to his father Isaac’s house in the land/region of Canaan.” or “to go/return to Canaan, to {the home of} his father Isaac.” or “to the land/region of Canaan, where his father Isaac lived.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “Then he {started} driving/herding {the camels} and all his {other} animals to/toward the land/region of Canaan where his father Isaac lived. {He took with him} all his possessions that he had accumulated, {including} all the livestock that he had acquired/accumulated {while living} in {the land/region of} Paddan Aram.” Do what is best in your language.
31:19	ilof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠לָבָ֣ן	1	“Now {before that,} Laban {the Aramean}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that the events in verse 19 happened before Jacob and his family had left. Also, for some languages it is more natural to first make “the Aramean” explicit here in verse 19 rather than wait until verse 20. Do what is best in your language.
31:19	akjd			הָלַ֔ךְ לִ⁠גְזֹ֖ז אֶת צֹאנ֑⁠וֹ	1	“had gone away {for several days} to cut the wool off his sheep”. In that culture, sheep wool was very important since it was used to make clothing and blankets. The process of shearing many sheep would have taken several days. You could include some of this information in a footnote.
31:19	zdy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּגְנֹ֣ב רָחֵ֔ל	1	“so {while he was gone,} Rachel {went into her father’s tent and} stole/took” or “{While he was gone,} Rachel {entered his tent and} stole/took”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.
31:19	vfcm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת הַ⁠תְּרָפִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠אָבִֽי⁠הָ	1	“his {household/family} idols/gods,” or “the idols/gods that he had/worshiped.” These idols were statues made of wood or precious metals. They were small enough to be used in a private home. In this chapter these statues are referred to as “idols” (in verses 19, 34, 35 when the author refers to them) and “gods” (in quotes in verses 30 and 32 when Laban or Jacob talk about them). If it is confusing in your language to switch back and forth between these two terms, you could use “gods” throughout this chapter, since Laban would not have called them idols, and Jacob would not have used that term in his presence. However, if possible, it is best to translate the two terms the way the Hebrew text has them.
31:20	p6en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּגְנֹ֣ב יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֶת לֵ֥ב	1	“and Jacob deceived/tricked” or “At the same time, Jacob deceived/tricked”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
31:20	rlvs			לָבָ֖ן הָ⁠אֲרַמִּ֑י	1	“Laban/him”. If you used “Aramean” earlier (verse 19), it may not be natural here. Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated this phrase in Gen 25:20.
31:20	z6av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל בְּלִי֙ הִגִּ֣יד ל֔⁠וֹ כִּ֥י בֹרֵ֖חַ הֽוּא	1	“by not informing/telling him that he was fleeing/leaving.” or “by fleeing/leaving {secretly} without informing/telling him that he was leaving.”
31:21	k7p0			וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח הוּא֙	1	“So Jacob {and his family} ran away” or “So {in that way} Jacob ran away {with his family}”. This statement summarizes an event that already happened (See verses 18 and 20). Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Jacob left a second time. To make this clear you could say, “After Jacob {and his family} ran away with everything that they owned, they {quickly} crossed the {Euphrates} River and headed toward the hill country of Gilead.”
31:21	zuha			וְ⁠כָל	1	“with all/everything” or “and {took/brought} all/everything”
31:21	els4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר ל֔⁠וֹ	1	“that {belonged} to them.” or “that he/they had/owned.” Make sure that your choice of pronouns throughout this verse fits with how you translate the beginning of this sentence.
31:21	bsy0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֖קָם וַ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֣ר אֶת הַ⁠נָּהָ֑ר	1	“He/They quickly crossed the {Euphrates} River”. The Euphrates River was also called “the River” because it was large and well-known. It was about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Haran, where Laban lived. This information could be put in a footnote.
31:21	bgnu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֥שֶׂם אֶת פָּנָ֖י⁠ו	1	“and headed toward” or “and went/traveled in the direction of”
31:21	ancy			הַ֥ר הַ⁠גִּלְעָֽד	1	“the mountain region of/called Gilead.” or “the hill country of/called Gilead.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could refer to: (1) mountains or hill country; or (2) a specific mountain (“Mount Gilead”).

31:22	pkx2			כִּ֥י בָרַ֖ח יַעֲקֹֽב	1	“that Jacob {and his family} had run away.” See how you translated “fleeing” and “fled” in verses 20-21.

See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 20:3. Also see how you translated “Laban the Aramean” in verse 20.

31:25	vjma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יַּשֵּׂ֥ג לָבָ֖ן אֶֽת יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	“So {when} Laban overtook Jacob,” or “{By the time that} Laban caught up with Jacob,” Make sure that the way you translate this clause does not sound like Laban overtook Jacob a second time. This is referring to what already happened in verse 23. See how you translated “overtook” there.
31:25	zquw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֗ב תָּקַ֤ע אֶֽת אָהֳל⁠וֹ֙	1	“Jacob {and his family} had {already} set/put up his/their tents” or “Jacob {and his family} had {already} set up camp”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob had already pitched his tents before Laban arrived. Also see how you translated “pitched his tent” in Gen 12:8 and 26:25.
31:25	inxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בָּ⁠הָ֔ר	1	“in the mountain region {of Gilead},” or “in the hill country {of Gilead},” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make “Gilead” explicit here (rather than later in this verse). Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “mountain{s} of Gilead” in verses 21 and 23.
31:25	w9ff			וְ⁠לָבָ֛ן & אֶת אֶחָ֖י⁠ו	1	“so Laban and {all} his relatives {that were with him}”

31:25	rxr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠הַ֥ר הַ⁠גִּלְעָֽד	1	“in the hill country of Gilead.” or “there {at a place nearby}.” If you made “Gilead” explicit earlier in this verse in your translation, it may not be necessary to repeat it here. Do what is best in your language.
31:26	bzmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר לָבָן֙ לְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“Then {the next day} Laban {went/came to Jacob and} complained to Jacob/him,” or “{The next day} Laban {met with Jacob and} {rebuked/confronted Jacob/him and} said to him,” See how you translated a similar quote margin in 29:25, when the roles were reversed and Jacob confronted Laban.
31:26	wmee		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֔יתָ	1	“Why have you done this?” or “Look what you have done!” or “What you have done is wrong!” Laban uses a rhetorical question here to express his anger at Jacob. Do what is best in your language to communicate that.
31:26	v8bo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּגְנֹ֖ב אֶת לְבָבִ֑⁠י	1	“You have deceived/tricked me” or “You have acted deceitfully toward me”. See how you translated the idiom “stole the heart of” in verse 20.
31:26	vx4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וַ⁠תְּנַהֵג֙ אֶת בְּנֹתַ֔⁠י	1	“and dragged away my daughters {with you}” or “and forced my daughters to leave {with you}”. Laban uses exaggeration to show he is angry and to try to make Jacob feel guilty for what he did.

31:27	xjrc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לֹא הִגַּ֣דְתָּ לִּ֔⁠י	1	“without telling me {you were leaving}!” or “{Why} didn’t you tell me {that you were leaving}?” or “You should have told me {you were leaving}!” Verse 27 is one long rhetorical question in the Hebrew text that expresses Laban’s anger at Jacob. For some languages it is better to break it up into two or more sentences. Do what is best in your language, and make sure that the punctuation fits well.
31:27	fe1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	וָֽ⁠אֲשַׁלֵּחֲ⁠ךָ֛ בְּ⁠שִׂמְחָ֥ה וּ⁠בְ⁠שִׁרִ֖ים	1	“{If I had known,} I/we would/could have {held a feast and} sent you {on your way}, singing joyful songs {together},” or “{If I had known,} I/we could/would have sent you {on your way} by {having a feast and} singing joyful songs {together},” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the events in this clause are contrary-to-fact (hypothetical).
31:27	b246		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠תֹ֥ף וּ⁠בְ⁠כִנּֽוֹר	1	“with tambourines and lyres/harps playing!” or “with/to the music/sound/playing of musical instruments!” For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in this sentence and say, “{If I had known,} we could have {held a feast and} sung joyful songs {and danced} together, with tambourines and lyres playing, before sending you {on your way}.” Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated “lyres/harps” in Gen 4:21.

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “kiss” in Gen 27:26-27.
31:28	xr6d			עַתָּ֖ה הִסְכַּ֥לְתָּֽ עֲשֽׂוֹ	1	“What you have done is {very} foolish/stupid!” or “You acted foolishly when you left {secretly} like that!”

31:29	u6cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵ֨י אֲבִי⁠כֶ֜ם אֶ֣מֶשׁ	1	“but last night {in a dream} the God whom your father serves”.

See how you translated a similar phrase (“the God of my father”) in verse 5.

31:30	wnvu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּה֙ הָלֹ֣ךְ הָלַ֔כְתָּ	1	“Now then, {I know/understand that} you left” or “Now, {I know/understand that} you went/ran away”. Begin this verse in a way which shows that Laban is introducing a new topic. Also notice that “you” shifts to singular here in verse 30.
31:30	f603			כִּֽי נִכְסֹ֥ף נִכְסַ֖פְתָּה	1	“because you longed so much” or “because you were so/very homesick”

31:31	ozrq			כִּ֣י אָמַ֔רְתִּי	1	“I told myself that {if you knew,}” or “I thought that {if I told you we were leaving,}” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.

31:33	hcfu			וּ⁠בְ⁠אֹ֛הֶל שְׁתֵּ֥י הָ⁠אֲמָהֹ֖ת	1	“and through/in the two servant women’s tent,” or “and through/in the tent where the two maidservants lived,” Consider again how you translated “slave/servant woman” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 20:17; 21:10, 12-13; 30:3; 31:33.

This kind of saddle was used as a seat and also had compartments or bags for carrying things. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Rachel had hidden the idols before Laban entered her tent. Also see how you translated “idols” in verse 19.
31:34	o2ev			וַ⁠תֵּ֣שֶׁב עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	“and she was sitting on the idols/gods/saddlebag.”

31:34	av6e			וְ⁠לֹ֥א מָצָֽא	1	“he did/could not find {them/anything}.” or “he did/could not find {the/his idols/gods}.” For some languages, it may be better to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “So Laban was not able to find {them}, even though he searched her tent thoroughly.”
31:35	ev0l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל אָבִ֗י⁠הָ	1	“Rather Rachel had said to him,” or “{As he was searching,} Rachel said to him,”

Make sure you translate “my lord” in a way that is appropriate for a daughter to show respect to her father; it should not sound like she was Laban’s slave or servant. The word “burn” is used here as an idiom that means to be angry. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also see how you translated this idiom in Gen 30:2.

31:36	tk5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה פִּשְׁעִ⁠י֙	1	“Tell me my crime!” or “Tell me what crime I have done/committed!” Jacob’s rhetorical questions in this verse show that he was angry at Laban. Do what is best in your language to communicate his anger.

31:39	izu2			טְרֵפָה֙ לֹא הֵבֵ֣אתִי אֵלֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“{And} whenever wild animals killed {any of} your animals, I never brought {the dead animal} to you {to show/prove I was innocent}.”
31:39	ccqy			אָנֹכִ֣י אֲחַטֶּ֔⁠נָּה	1	“{Rather/Instead,} I paid for that loss myself.” or “{Rather/Instead,} I replaced them at my own expense.” Normally it was the owner of the flocks (not the shepherds) who took care of the expense when an animal was killed or stolen. You could put that information in a footnote.
31:39	r3p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠יָּדִ֖⁠י תְּבַקְשֶׁ֑⁠נָּה	1	“{Besides that,} you required me to pay for” or “You {also} made me pay for”. Consider what is the best way to translate this idiom in your language.

31:40	w4mt			וְ⁠קֶ֣רַח בַּ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה וַ⁠תִּדַּ֥ד	1	“and at night {I suffered from} the frost/cold, so that I could not/hardly sleep.” or “and during the nights it was so cold that I could not/hardly sleep.”

It could mean: (1) “the One/God whom Isaac fears/reveres” or (2) “Isaac’s God whom {people/others} are afraid/terrified of”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is only talking about one God in this verse, not two or three. Also notice that “my father” and “Isaac” both refer to Jacob’s father Isaac, not two different people.
31:42	o6jb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	לוּלֵ֡י & הָ֣יָה לִ֔⁠י	1	“had not been with me {to take care of me},” or “had not been with me {protecting me and guiding me},” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the events in this sentence are contrary-to-fact (hypothetical) and imply that God actually had been with Jacob, so that Laban did not send him away empty-handed.
31:42	x6l8			כִּ֥י עַתָּ֖ה & שִׁלַּחְתָּ֑⁠נִי	1	“you would certainly be sending me away now” or “there is no doubt/question that I would now be leaving {here}”

Consider whether or not a rhetorical question fits well here in your language.

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “So now” in verse 16 and “cut a covenant” in Gen 26:28.
31:44	e2ml			וְ⁠הָיָ֥ה	1	“and let there be” or “and there should be”. The subject of the Hebrew verb in this phrase is masculine singular, so it cannot refer to “covenant,” which is feminine singular. It is probably best to translate this phrase in a general way.
31:44	hw1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לְ⁠עֵ֖ד בֵּינִ֥⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	“a witness/memorial to remind us {of our covenant/treaty}.” or “something to remind us {to keep that covenant/treaty}.” If your language has a dual pronoun for “us”, you could use it in this verse. Also, if your language distinguishes exclusive and inclusive pronouns, you could use the inclusive form of “us” here.
31:45	o8yl			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֥ח יַעֲקֹ֖ב אָ֑בֶן	1	“So Jacob picked out a {large} stone”. See how you translated “stone” in Gen 28:18.

31:46	d3ho			וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֤ב לְ⁠אֶחָי⁠ו֙	1	“Then Jacob/he told his relatives,” These relatives would have included Jacob’s sons, as well as Laban and his men who had come with him. See how you translated “relatives” in verses 23, 25, 32, 37.
31:46	mwu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-politeness	לִקְט֣וּ אֲבָנִ֔ים	1	“Gather {some more} stones.” or “{Please} gather {some} stones.” Make sure that your translation of Jacob’s request sounds polite here, not rude or demanding, but also not begging.

Make sure that is clear in your language.
31:49	f54v			וְ⁠הַ⁠מִּצְפָּה֙	1	“{It is/was} also {called/named} Mizpah,” or “People also call {the place,} Mizpah,” or “{Another name for the place is} Mizpah, {which means “watchtower,”}”

Some languages have a dual pronoun that fits here well. Do what is natural in your language.
31:50	v7k5			אִם תְּעַנֶּ֣ה אֶת בְּנֹתַ֗⁠י	1	“If you treat my daughters badly,” or “If you mistreat/oppress my daughters,” See how you translated “afflict” in Gen 15:13 and 16:6, and how you translated a related word (“affliction”) in verse 42.

Terah worshiped other gods (Joshua 24:2), and so did Laban (verses 19, 30), which suggests that Nahor served the same gods that his father Terah served, and then taught his son Laban to do the same thing. In spite of that, many translations still capitalize “God” all three times here in verse 53. Be consistent with how you spelled “Nahor” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 11:22-25, 29; 12:26-27; 22:20, 24, 28; 24:9, 15, 24, 47; 29:5; 31:53.

31:53	d5h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-term	וַ⁠יִּשָּׁבַ֣ע יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“But Jacob swore” or “Then/But Jacob made/vowed a vow”. Jacob refused to swear by the gods of Nahor and Terah. See how you translated “swore” in Gen 26:31, and compare that to how you translated a related phrase (“vowed a vow”) in 31:13.
31:53	jtf2			בְּ⁠פַ֖חַד אָבִ֥י⁠ו יִצְחָֽק	1	“by the God whom his father Isaac feared/revered, {that he would keep their treaty,}” or “with the Fear/God of his father Isaac as his witness/enforcer,” See how you translated “the Fear of Isaac” in verse 42.
31:54	j4i6			וַ⁠יִּזְבַּ֨ח יַעֲקֹ֥ב זֶ֨בַח֙ בָּ⁠הָ֔ר	1	“and Jacob/he offered an animal sacrifice {to God} {on an altar} on the/a mountain/hill.” or “and Jacob/he burned {the body of} an animal {on an altar} as a sacrifice {to God} on the/a mountain/hill.” Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob burned the animal while it was still alive. Also see how you translated “sacrificed” in Gen 22:13.
31:54	xzn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א לְ⁠אֶחָ֖י⁠ו לֶ⁠אֱכָל לָ֑חֶם	1	“Then he invited his relatives to eat a meal {together} {there}.” In the Bible, “bread” is often used as an idiom that refers to food in general. In this context, it was a meal that they shared together. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
31:54	lc58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אכְלוּ לֶ֔חֶם וַ⁠יָּלִ֖ינוּ בָּ⁠הָֽר	1	“Then after they had eaten the meal, they spent the night {there} on the/that mountain/hill.” or “So they {all} ate the meal {together} and spent the night there.” As in Genesis 26:30, eating together was an important part of the covenant or treaty process, since it shows unity and close relationship, as if they were part of the same family. Some of that information could be included in a footnote.
31:55	m83j			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם לָבָ֜ן בַּ⁠בֹּ֗קֶר	1	“The next morning Laban got up early” or “Early the next morning Laban got up”. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 28:18.

It was a Hebrew custom for relatives and close friends to greet each other with a kiss on each cheek. Only make this information explicit here if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning.
31:55	k8dd			וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֶתְ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	“and asked God to bless them.”
31:55	v5ei			וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ וַ⁠יָּ֥שָׁב לָבָ֖ן לִ⁠מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	“Then Laban/he {and his men} left {from there} and returned home.” or “Then Laban/he left {from there} {with his men} and went back home.”
32:1	zb5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֖ב הָלַ֣ךְ לְ⁠דַרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“Then/Meanwhile Jacob {also} {left from there and} went/continued on his way/journey {home} {with his family},” You can make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to make the meaning accurate and clear.
32:1	jfda			וַ⁠יִּפְגְּעוּ ב֖⁠וֹ מַלְאֲכֵ֥י אֱלֹהִֽים	1	“and {some} angels from God met/encountered him.” Translate “met” in a way that allows for the fact that no conversation is recorded between the angels and Jacob and that the angels were probably not hostile; for example, they may have been sent by God to escort and protect him.
32:2	a5gq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָאָ֔⁠ם	1	“When Jacob saw the angels, he said/exclaimed {in surprise},” Make sure that you refer to Jacob and the angels here in a way that is accurate and natural in your language.
32:2	u5u0			מַחֲנֵ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים זֶ֑ה	1	“This {is} God’s army!” or “God’s camp/army must be here/nearby!” or “God’s army is {stationed/camping} here!”

Also see how you translated “he called the name of that place” in Gen 28:19.
32:3	egca			וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֨ח יַעֲקֹ֤ב מַלְאָכִים֙ לְ⁠פָנָ֔י⁠ו	1	“Then Jacob sent {some} messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau” or “Then Jacob sent {some} of his servants ahead of him to give/deliver a message to his brother Esau”

Do this in a way that is natural in your language.
32:4	iepc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֤ה אָמַר֙ עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“I, your servant Jacob, want you to know that” or “This is a message from Jacob who wants to serve you:” Verses 4 and 5 have two levels of embedded quotes. Some languages need to use indirect quotes for one or both of those levels; for example, “Your servant Jacob wants you to know that he has been sojourning/staying with {your uncle} Laban all this time.” Do what is best in your language.
32:4	qibe			עִם לָבָ֣ן גַּ֔רְתִּי וָ⁠אֵחַ֖ר עַד עָֽתָּה	1	“I have been staying with {our uncle} Laban all this time.” or “Since we last saw each other, I have been staying/living with {Uncle} Laban.”

32:5	n5iq			שׁ֣וֹר וַ⁠חֲמ֔וֹר צֹ֖אן	1	“{many} cattle, donkeys, and flocks {of sheep and goats},” See how you translated “donkeys” and “flocks” in Gen 12:16.
32:5	axuo			וְ⁠עֶ֣בֶד וְ⁠שִׁפְחָ֑ה	1	“as well as {many} male/men and female/women slaves/servants.” See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 12:16.

It is helpful if you read your translation aloud to check for accuracy and naturalness.
32:5	fagg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠מְצֹא חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	“hoping that you will be gracious/kind {to me} {when I arrive}.” or “so that {when we see/meet each other} you will be pleased with me {and welcome me}.” See how you translated the idiom “found favor in your eyes” in Gen 30:27.

32:6	makp			וְ⁠גַם֙ הֹלֵ֣ךְ לִ⁠קְרָֽאתְ⁠ךָ֔	1	“Now he is on his way {here} to meet you,” or “and he is already headed here to meet you,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, notice that the word “meet” is neutral in this context and does not imply whether or not Esau had hostile intent against Jacob.
32:6	o1mv			וְ⁠אַרְבַּע מֵא֥וֹת אִ֖ישׁ עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“and/but {there are} {also} 400 men {coming} with him!” or “and/but {he has} 400 men with him!”

Also make sure it is clear that Jacob is talking directly to Yahweh, not talking about him.

See how you translated “she-goats”, “he-goats”, “ewes” and “rams” in Gen 31:10.

The idiom “cover his face” means to try to calm someone’s anger by doing something to please him. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom you could use here.
32:20	ne75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בַּ⁠מִּנְחָה֙ הַ⁠הֹלֶ֣כֶת לְ⁠פָנָ֔⁠י	1	“him this gift/present {of animals} ahead of me” or “this gift {of animals} to him ahead of me”. For some languages it is more natural to use an indirect quote here and say, “because he thought that if he sent the gifts {of animals} ahead of himself {to Esau}, then Esau would stop being angry at him.” Notice that this alternate translation also changes the clause order. Do what is best in your language.

Make sure it is clear in your translation that this is the same night that was referred to in verse 21. Also, the phrase “got up” often refers to initiating an action, but here it may also imply that Jacob got up out of bed after sleeping for a while.
32:22	fc8d			אֶת שְׁתֵּ֤י נָשָׁי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠אֶת שְׁתֵּ֣י שִׁפְחֹתָ֔י⁠ו וְ⁠אֶת אַחַ֥ד עָשָׂ֖ר יְלָדָ֑י⁠ו	1	“his two wives, his two servant wives and his eleven sons” or “his two wives, two concubines and eleven sons”. Consider what is the best way in your language to list these people. See what you did for a similar list of people in Gen 7:13.
32:22	b3kt			וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֔ר	1	“and waded/walked across” or “across”
32:22	e2wn			אֵ֖ת מַעֲבַ֥ר יַבֹּֽק	1	“a shallow place on/in the Jabbok {Stream/River}.” or “a place in the Jabbok {Stream/River} that was shallow.” A ford is a very shallow place in a stream that is fairly easy and safe for people and animals to walk across. The Jabbok Stream was a small river that flowed from east to west into the Jordan River about halfway between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Jacob took his wives and children from the north side of the stream to the south side; his brother was coming towards them from further south. It might be helpful to include a map here in your translation that includes the places named in this chapter and shows where Jacob and Esau were coming from.
32:23	xi98			וַ⁠יִּקָּחֵ֔⁠ם וַ⁠יַּֽעֲבִרֵ֖⁠ם אֶת הַ⁠נָּ֑חַל	1	“{After} he had taken them across the stream/river,” or “After he did that,” Verse 23 refers back to what already happened in verse 22. Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob’s wives and children crossed the Jabbok Stream twice in verses 22-23.
32:23	p97f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֵ֖ר אֶת אֲשֶׁר ל⁠וֹ	1	“he {went back and} had his servants take {everything} that he owned across {the stream/river} {too}.” or “he {went back and} had his servants take {all} his {livestock/animals and other} belongings/possessions across {the stream/river} {too}.” At some point, Jacob went back to the north side of the Jabbok Stream, while his family waited for him on the south side. His belongings included the animals that he had not sent ahead to Esau as well as all his other possessions.
32:24	vh2l			וַ⁠יִּוָּתֵ֥ר יַעֲקֹ֖ב לְ⁠בַדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“Then Jacob was {there} by himself {for a while},” or “After that, Jacob was alone {there} {for a while},”
32:24	fwnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics	וַ⁠יֵּאָבֵ֥ק אִישׁ֙ עִמּ֔⁠וֹ	1	“and/but {then} a man {came and} wrestled/fought with him”. At some point, Jacob realized that this man was Yahweh in the form of a man (verse 30), so translation teams that capitalize references to God will capitalize all the pronouns that refer to him in verses 24-29 and may or may not capitalize “Man” in these verses. See what you did for a similar case when Yahweh appeared as a man to Abraham in Gen 18.
32:24	hyuk			עַ֖ד עֲל֥וֹת הַ⁠שָּֽׁחַר	1	“until dawn/daybreak.” or “until daylight started to appear.” The word “dawn” refers to the time before sunrise when the sky begins to get light.
32:25	ddzn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֗רְא כִּ֣י לֹ֤א יָכֹל֙ ל֔⁠וֹ	1	“Then the man realized that he could not overpower/defeat him/Jacob, so” or “When the man saw/realized that he was not able to defeat him/Jacob,” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to in verses 25-29.
32:25	dhow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּגַּ֖ע בְּ⁠כַף יְרֵכ֑⁠וֹ	1	“he struck/hit {him/Jacob} on his hip,” or “he touched/struck his/Jacob’s hip joint,”

Consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun phrase or a pronoun here to refer to Jacob’s hip joint.
32:25	mc3x			בְּ⁠הֵֽאָבְק֖⁠וֹ עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“as he/Jacob wrestled/fought with the man.” or “as they wrestled/fought with/against each other.”

32:26	y2gk			כִּ֥י עָלָ֖ה הַ⁠שָּׁ֑חַר	1	“because it is dawn/daybreak!” or “because daylight is beginning to come!” See how you translated “the dawn came up” in verse 24.

32:27	etk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	מַה שְּׁמֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	“Tell me your name.” or “what his name was.” Consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language.
32:27	xvcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר יַעֲקֹֽב	1	“He/Jacob answered {him}, “{My name is} Jacob.” ” or “And he told him his name was Jacob.” or “And Jacob told him his name.” Make sure in your translation that Jacob’s reply sounds respectful. Also consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language.
32:28	twx4			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“Then the man said {to Jacob},”
32:28	uf7y			לֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ יֵאָמֵ֥ר עוֹד֙ שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֔	1	“Your name will no longer be Jacob,” or “You will no longer be called/named Jacob,” The wording here is similar to what God said when he changed Abram’s name to Abraham (Gen 17:5) and Sarai’s name to Sarah (17:15). After that, Abraham and Sarah were no longer called by their previous names. In the case of Jacob, he continues to be referred to by both of his names in this chapter (“Jacob” in verses 29-30, 32; “Israel” in verse 32) and throughout the rest of the Bible, including by God (Gen 46:2). It could be that although God was changing Jacob’s primary name to “Israel,” he was still known by his previous name too. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
32:28	qbvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּ֖י אִם יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	“but {rather} {it will be} Israel, {which means “he who struggles/contends with God,”}” If you include the meaning of the name “Israel” in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translate “struggled” in the following clause.
32:28	udk7			כִּֽי שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם אֱלֹהִ֛ים וְ⁠עִם אֲנָשִׁ֖ים	1	“because you have struggled/contended with/against {both} God and men/people,” The Hebrew word for “struggled” here is more general than the word for “wrestled” in verses 24 and 25.
32:28	yhdd			וַ⁠תּוּכָֽל	1	“and you have won/overcome.” See how you translated “prevailed” in verse 25 and Gen 30:8. It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly different ways, depending on the context.
32:29	bkfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics	וַ⁠יִּשְׁאַ֣ל יַעֲקֹ֗ב וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	“Then Jacob asked him” or “Then Jacob asked the man”. Consider again whether or not you have capitalized references to the man in verses 24-29. See the note about this at verse 24.
32:29	cidm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	הַגִּֽידָ⁠ה נָּ֣א שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	“What is your name?” or “what his name was.” or “to tell him his name.” Consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language.
32:29	ct8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	“But he replied,” or “But the man replied,”
32:29	otq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֥⁠מָּה זֶּ֖ה תִּשְׁאַ֣ל	1	“There is no need for you to ask {me}” or “You do not need to ask {me}”. This rhetorical question probably means that there was no need for Jacob to ask the man what his name was; he should have known without asking. Consider whether or not it is best to use a rhetorical question here in your language.
32:29	gbbo			לִ⁠שְׁמִ֑⁠י	1	“to tell you my name!” or “what my name is!”

32:30	fpdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	רָאִ֤יתִי אֱלֹהִים֙ פָּנִ֣ים אֶל פָּנִ֔ים	1	“I saw God’s face {here},” or “I saw/met God in person {here},”
32:30	qdf5			וַ⁠תִּנָּצֵ֖ל נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	“but/and {yet} my life was spared {by him}!” or “but/and {yet} he has allowed me to live!” Jacob was amazed that he was still alive because, although there were exceptions (Exodus 33:11; Judges 13:22), normally people could not see God face to face and live (Exodus 33:20). You could put that information in a footnote so that readers understand why Jacob was surprised.
32:31	s3cw			וַ⁠יִּֽזְרַֽח ל֣⁠וֹ הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1	“The sun shined on Jacob” or “The sun was rising/shining”
32:31	qtbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָבַ֖ר אֶת פְּנוּאֵ֑ל	1	“as he/Jacob left Penuel {and returned to his family}.” Penuel is another name for the place that is called Peniel in verse 30. That information could be put in a footnote. Or you could use the same spelling in both verses to avoid confusion; “Penuel” is the spelling in the rest of the Old Testament.
32:31	kp04			וְ⁠ה֥וּא צֹלֵ֖עַ	1	“He was limping {as he walked}” or “{As he walked,} he was limping”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

32:32	hbfm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁר֙ עַל־כַּ֣ף הַ⁠יָּרֵ֔ךְ	1	“that is/was attached to an {animal’s} hip socket/joint,” or “that comes from an {animal’s} hip socket/joint,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that this is talking about eating meat from an animal, not about cannibalism.

33:1	kz1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב עֵינָ֗י⁠ו וַ⁠יַּרְא֙	1	“Then Jacob looked up and saw” or “Then Jacob looked {ahead of him} and saw”. Make sure your translation of this idiom does not mean that Jacob looked straight up. Rather, he probably looked carefully to the south (the direction that his brother was coming from).
33:1	ilei			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה עֵשָׂ֣ו בָּ֔א	1	“{in the distance} that Esau was coming {toward him},” or “that Esau was {in the distance} coming/heading {his direction/way},” Esau was still a fair distance away, which gave Jacob time to do everything that he does in verses 1-3.
33:1	ozjn			וְ⁠עִמּ֕⁠וֹ אַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת אִ֑ישׁ	1	“and with him {were} 400 men!” or “with 400 men!” or “and that he had 400 men with him!”

See how you translated “divided” in Gen 32:7 and “his two maidservants” in Gen 32:22.
33:2	iser			וַ⁠יָּ֧שֶׂם אֶת הַ⁠שְּׁפָח֛וֹת וְ⁠אֶת יַלְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ן	1	“He put his {two} servant wives and/with their children” or “He put the group that had/included his {two} servant wives and their children”. See how you translated “his two maidservants” in Gen 32:22.
33:2	v7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	רִֽאשֹׁנָ֑ה	1	“first {in line},” or “in front {of all the others},” For some languages it is more natural to put phrases like “first” and “after them” at the beginning of their clauses and say, “First {in line} he put his {two} servant wives and/with their children. Behind them {he put} Leah and/with her children, and last {of all} {he put} Rachel and/with {her son} Joseph.” Do what is best in your language.

Make sure that the way you translate “fell on his neck” does not imply that Esau accidentally fell. Rather, this is an idiom that means he embraced Jacob warmly, with much emotion.
33:4	nnax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וַ⁠יִּבְכּֽוּ	1	“and/as they {both} cried {for joy}.” or “Both of them cried {because they were so happy to see each other again}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

33:5	mix3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר חָנַ֥ן אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת עַבְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	“whom God has graciously/kindly given to {me,} your servant.” or “whom God has graciously/kindly given to me, sir.” Jacob uses the phrase “your servant” to be polite and show respect to Esau; he was not actually Esau’s servant. For some languages it is more natural to put the honorific title first in this sentence and say, “Sir, {they are} the {wives and} children whom God has graciously given to me.” Do what is best in your language.
33:6	c9es			וַ⁠תִּגַּ֧שְׁןָ הַ⁠שְּׁפָח֛וֹת הֵ֥נָּה וְ⁠יַלְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ן	1	“Then the {two} maidservants came closer {to Esau} {along} with their children,” or “Then the/Jacob’s {two} servant wives and their children came/went closer/forward,” See how you translated “maidservants” in verses 1-2.

33:9	b7wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	“But Esau replied,” or “Esau said/replied {to him},” What Esau says is in contrast to what Jacob said, but it may not be necessary to use a conjunction here at all. Do what is best in your language.

33:10	tfke			אַל נָא֙	1	“No, I beg you.” or “Please don’t refuse {my gift}.” In verses 10 and 11, Jacob speaks urgently to Esau, because in that culture if Esau accepts Jacob’s gift, he is committing himself to treat Jacob as a friend.
33:10	z182			אִם נָ֨א מָצָ֤אתִי חֵן֙ בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“{Rather,} if you are pleased with me,” or “{Rather,} if you want to be gracious/kind to me, then”. See how you translated the idiom “find/gain favor in your eyes” in verse 8.

However, God had been gracious to Jacob and allowed him to live (Genesis 32:30). In the same way, it was a terrifying thing for Jacob to see Esau who had 400 men with him, but Esau was gracious to him (33:4).

33:11	dx0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּפְצַר בּ֖⁠וֹ	1	“He/Jacob kept urging him/Esau {to accept his gift}” or “He/Jacob kept insisting {that he/Esau accept the gift/livestock/animals from him}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation who and what is being referred to at every point in this sentence.

33:12	zjf4			וְ⁠אֵלְכָ֖ה לְ⁠נֶגְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	“and I will lead/accompany/escort you.” Esau is suggesting that he would accompany or escort Jacob and his family, not that he would go far ahead of them.
33:13	hxkz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֗י⁠ו	1	“But he/Jacob replied to him,” or “But Jacob replied,”

33:13	xg08			וְ⁠הַ⁠צֹּ֥אן וְ⁠הַ⁠בָּקָ֖ר עָל֣וֹת עָלָ֑⁠י	1	“and some of my sheep and cattle are nursing {their young}.” or “and I need {to be careful with} {all} the sheep and cattle that are nursing {their young}.” See how you translated “flock{s} and herd{s}” in Gen 12:16.
33:13	gbse			וּ⁠דְפָקוּ⁠ם֙ י֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	“If my servants/men drive the livestock/animals {too hard/far} in one day,” or “If I force the livestock/animals to go/travel too far/fast {for} {even} one day,”
33:13	c17q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וָ⁠מֵ֖תוּ כָּל הַ⁠צֹּֽאן	1	“then all the flock{s} {and herds} will die.” or “then all of them will die.” This phrase especially refers to the sheep and cattle that were nursing, but Jacob is probably using hyperbole here (“all”) to emphasize that he does not want to travel too fast.
33:14	g9ie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics	יַעֲבָר נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	“{So then,} sir, please go on {home} ahead of me, sir.” See how you translated Jacob’s use of “my lord” (in verse 8) and “servant” (in verse 5) to show respect and deference to Esau. Here he uses both terms for emphasis.
33:14	qgdi			וַ⁠אֲנִ֞י אֶֽתְנָהֲלָ֣ה לְ⁠אִטִּ֗⁠י לְ⁠רֶ֨גֶל הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר לְ⁠פָנַ⁠י֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠רֶ֣גֶל הַ⁠יְלָדִ֔ים	1	“Then/Meanwhile I will travel along slowly at a pace/speed {that is safe/good} for the livestock/animals and children that are with me,”

33:14	tb57			שֵׂעִֽירָ⁠ה	1	“in {the land/region of} Seir.” See how you translated “the land of Seir” in Gen 32:3. The land of Seir was a mountainous region southeast of the land of Canaan (and the Dead Sea) and was where Esau had settled. It was also called “Edom” (Gen 32:3), which was Esau’s nickname (Gen 25:30). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

33:15	phvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	“But Jacob replied,” or “Jacob said/replied {to him},” or “Jacob answered {him},” Make sure the way you translate this quote margin fits with how you translate the previous and following sentences.
33:15	a29j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֣⁠מָּה זֶּ֔ה	1	“There’s no need for that.” or “There is no need {for you} to do that.” Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize that there is no need for Esau to leave any of his men with him. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to use a statement here instead. Do what is best in your language.
33:15	evmh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics	אֶמְצָא חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽ⁠י	1	“{Just} please {continue to} be gracious/kind to me, sir.” or “Sir, please {just} {continue to} treat me kindly.” Consider again how you translated “my lord” in verses 8,13-15. For some languages it is more natural to put this address earlier in this quote. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the idiom “find favor in the eyes of” in verse 8.
33:16	r6yz			וַ⁠יָּשָׁב֩ בַּ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠ה֥וּא עֵשָׂ֛ו לְ⁠דַרְכּ֖⁠וֹ	1	“So that {very/same} day Esau {and his men} started on their way back” or “So that {very/same} day Esau {and his men} left and headed back”

Also see how you translated “travel” in verse 12.
33:17	moyc			וַ⁠יִּ֥בֶן ל֖⁠וֹ בָּ֑יִת	1	“There he {and his men/servants} built a house for himself {and his family/household},” or “where he {and his men/servants} built a house for his family/household,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
33:17	kw1x			וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְנֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ עָשָׂ֣ה סֻכֹּ֔ת	1	“and they {also} built {some} shelters for his livestock/animals.” or “and shelters for his livestock/animals.” The term “livestock” is general here and includes all of Jacob’s animals.
33:17	oyhe			עַל כֵּ֛ן	1	“That is why” or “Because of that,” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 32:32.
33:17	tv48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קָרָ֥א שֵׁם הַ⁠מָּק֖וֹם סֻכּֽוֹת	1	“the name of that place/town is {called} Succoth, {which means “shelters.”}” or “they/people call that place/town Succoth, {which means “shelters.”}” The phrase “he/they called” could refer to Jacob, or it could refer to people in general (as it often does in Genesis). If you include the meaning of the name Succoth in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “shelters” earlier in this verse.
33:18	uqlg			וַ⁠יָּבֹא֩ יַעֲקֹ֨ב שָׁלֵ֜ם עִ֣יר שְׁכֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן בְּ⁠בֹא֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠פַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם	1	“Later Jacob {and his family} arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land/region of Canaan, as he/they continued traveling {home} from {the land/region of} Paddan Aram,” or “{After that,} Jacob {and his family} continued their journey {home} from {the land/region of} Paddan Aram, until {eventually} they arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land/region of Canaan,” Jacob and his family had left Paddan Aram and had been traveling back to the land of his ancestors in Canaan (Gen 31:3, 13, 18). See how you translated “in peace” in Gen 28:21.
33:18	q3jx			וַ⁠יִּ֖חַן	1	“and he/they set up camp {in a field}” or “Then he/they set up his/their tents {in a field}”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “camped” in Gen 26:17.
33:18	a1lz			אֶת פְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	“near/beside the/that city.” or “on the edge/outskirts of the/that city.”

One of Hamor’s sons was named Shechem.” or “for/with one hundred pieces {of silver/money} from the sons of Hamor {who was} the father of Shechem.” The weight and value of a hundred kesitahs of silver is not known. Some ancient translations (including the LXX and Latin Vulgate) have “a hundred lambs” here, but most modern translations have “a hundred pieces of silver/money”.
33:20	lob7			וַ⁠יַּצֶּב שָׁ֖ם מִזְבֵּ֑חַ	1	“On that land he/Jacob {also} built a {stone} altar,” or “Jacob {also} built/made an altar {out of stones} on that land,” See how you translated “altar” in Gen 26:25.

34:1	xwzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠תֵּצֵ֤א דִינָה֙ בַּת־לֵאָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלְדָ֖ה לְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	“Then/Now {one day} Dinah, {who was} the daughter whom Leah bore/had for Jacob, went out” or “{One day,} Dinah, {who was} the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went {to/into the city}” These events took place at an unspecified time after Jacob and his family set up their camp beside the city of Shechem (Gen 33:18). Consider what is the best way to introduce a new event in your language. Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Dinah” in Gen 30:21.
34:1	da5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠רְא֖וֹת	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The verb “to see” could mean: (1) “to visit with”; many languages have a similar idiom. (2) “to see/observe” the local women, for example, how they dressed and what jewelry they wore.
34:1	xo8b			בִּ⁠בְנ֥וֹת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“{some of} the women who were native to that area/region.” or “{some of} the local/native women.” See how you translated “daughters of the land” in Gen 27:46, and how you translated a similar phrase (“people of the land”) in Gen 23:7, 12.
34:2	kd4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יַּ֨רְא & שְׁכֶ֧ם בֶּן חֲמ֛וֹר הַֽ⁠חִוִּ֖י נְשִׂ֣יא הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	“Then Shechem, who was the/a son of the Hivite named Hamor who ruled that region, saw” or “Now the ruler/chief of that region was a Hivite named Hamor. His son Shechem saw”. Consider which order of phrases is best here in your language. Also see how you translated “Hivites” in Gen 10:17 and “ruler” in Gen 25:16.
34:2	ht9l			אֹתָ֜⁠הּ & וַ⁠יִּקַּ֥ח אֹתָ֛⁠הּ	1	“Dinah, and he grabbed {hold of} her” or “{how beautiful} Dinah was, so he took/grabbed {hold of} her”
34:2	ptfl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יִּשְׁכַּ֥ב אֹתָ֖⁠הּ וַ⁠יְעַנֶּֽ⁠הָ	1	“and forced her to go to bed with him.” or “and raped her.” This is a euphemistic way of saying that Shechem forced Dinah to have sex with him. Translate this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when hearing your translation read aloud.
34:3	l9qg			וַ⁠תִּדְבַּ֣ק נַפְשׁ֔⁠וֹ בְּ⁠דִינָ֖ה בַּֽת יַעֲקֹ֑ב וַ⁠יֶּֽאֱהַב֙	1	“He/Shechem was strongly/deeply attracted to Jacob’s daughter Dinah and he loved her” or “He/Shechem admired Jacob’s daughter Dinah so much that he fell in love with her” or “He/Shechem admired her so much that he fell in love with her”
34:3	nd16			וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֖ר עַל לֵ֥ב הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָֽ	1	“and spoke sweetly/tenderly to her {to try to woo/persuade/comfort her}.” or “and {tried to win her heart/affection} by speaking tenderly/kindly to her.” See how you translated “young woman” in Gen 24:14, and see the note about that there.
34:4	q2v0			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר שְׁכֶ֔ם אֶל חֲמ֥וֹר אָבִ֖י⁠ו לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“Then Shechem said to his father Hamor,” or “Then Shechem {went to} his father Hamor and requested/demanded,”
34:4	u0r8			קַֽח לִ֛⁠י אֶת הַ⁠יַּלְדָּ֥ה הַ⁠זֹּ֖את לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	“Negotiate {things} for me so that I can marry this girl.” or “Ask this girl’s family to let me marry her.” At that time it was normal for parents to negotiate with another family to get a spouse for their child. The negotiations would include a bride-price and other details. You could put some of that information in a footnote. The term “girl” that Shechem uses here is less respectful than the term “young woman” that is used in verses 3 and 12.
34:5	ern7			וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֣ב שָׁמַ֗ע כִּ֤י	1	“When Jacob found out that” or “When Jacob was told/informed {by someone} that”
34:5	iqjy			טִמֵּא֙ אֶת דִּינָ֣ה בִתּ֔⁠וֹ	1	“Shechem had dishonored/disgraced his daughter Dinah,” or “his daughter Dinah had been defiled/disgraced by Shechem,”
34:5	ikpl			וּ⁠בָנָ֛י⁠ו הָי֥וּ אֶת מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה	1	“his sons were {still} tending his livestock/animals out in the fields,” or “his sons were {still} {out} in the fields taking care of his livestock/animals,”
34:5	b462			וְ⁠הֶחֱרִ֥שׁ יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	“so he didn’t say anything {about it}” or “so he didn’t tell anyone {about it}”. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not mean that Jacob was totally silent. Rather, it means he did not speak about what Shechem had done to Dinah.
34:5	vahs			עַד בֹּאָֽ⁠ם	1	“until they came {back} {home}.” or “until they returned {home}.”
34:6	huzm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֛א חֲמ֥וֹר אֲבִֽי שְׁכֶ֖ם	1	“Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor went {with his son}” or “Meanwhile, {Shechem and} Shechem’s/his father Hamor went”. For some languages it is more natural to introduce Shechem here, rather than wait and have him appear too suddenly in verse 11. Do what is best in your language.
34:6	fxey			אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֑ב לְ⁠דַבֵּ֖ר אִתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“to talk with/to Jacob.” or “to Jacob’s {camp/tent} to talk with/to him.”
34:7	celp			וּ⁠בְנֵ֨י יַעֲקֹ֜ב בָּ֤אוּ מִן הַ⁠שָּׂדֶה֙	1	“Then/Soon Jacob’s sons came/returned {home} from the fields.”
34:7	ydmu			כְּ⁠שָׁמְעָ֔⁠ם	1	“When they heard {what had happened},” or “When they heard {that Shechem had raped their sister},” Many translations put “when they heard” with the previous sentence. However, unless someone else told Jacob’s sons the news of what happened, that interpretation contradicts verse 5, which says that Jacob kept quiet about it until his sons got home.
34:7	cnrm			וַ⁠יִּֽתְעַצְּבוּ֙ הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	“they were {very} distressed/shocked”. See how you translated “grieved” in Gen 6:6. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
34:7	m7g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֥חַר לָ⁠הֶ֖ם מְאֹ֑ד	1	“and filled with anger,” or “and extremely angry”. See how you translated the idiom “it/anger burned within …” in Gen 32:36.
34:7	csph			כִּֽי נְבָלָ֞ה עָשָׂ֣ה בְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	“because/that Shechem had disgraced/dishonored {the people/family of} Israel” or “because/that Shechem had brought shame on Israel’s family”. Notice in this verse that the Hebrew text has both of Jacob’s names, “Jacob” and “Israel,” to emphasize that Shechem had sinned against Jacob and all of his descendants (the people of Israel). You could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of “Israel” does not refer here to a place, since Israel was not yet a country or a territory.
34:7	e6q9			לִ⁠שְׁכַּב֙ אֶת בַּֽת יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“by having sexual relations with Jacob’s daughter.” or “by raping Jacob’s daughter.”
34:7	wf5f			וְ⁠כֵ֖ן לֹ֥א יֵעָשֶֽׂה	1	“Such a {wicked/terrible} thing should never be done {by anyone}!” or “No one should ever do such a {wicked/horrible} thing/crime!”
34:8	omfw			וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר חֲמ֖וֹר אִתָּ֣⁠ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“But Hamor pleaded with Jacob and his sons and said,” or “But Hamor urged/begged Jacob and his sons,”
34:8	ma3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בְּ⁠בִתְּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	“My son Shechem really/deeply loves your {family’s} daughter.” or “My son Shechem has fallen {deeply/completely} in love with your daughter {and sister}.” The pronoun “your” is plural here, which shows that Hamor is addressing not only Jacob but also his sons.
34:8	sx6u			תְּנ֨וּ נָ֥א אֹתָ֛⁠הּ ל֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	“{So} please allow/permit him to marry her.” The way “give” and “take” are used in verses 8, 9, 12, 16 and 21 reflects the culture at that time, when parents or families arranged marriages for their daughters. Also see the note about this at verse 4.
34:9	elqs			וְ⁠הִֽתְחַתְּנ֖וּ אֹתָ֑⁠נוּ	1	“{In fact,} let’s allow marriage between our two people groups,” or “Let’s agree to let members of our families marry one another,”

34:10	rrpa			וְ⁠אִתָּ֖⁠נוּ תֵּשֵׁ֑בוּ	1	“You can {also} settle/live among us.” or “{We also invite you to} settle/live with/among us.”
34:10	x3fi			וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙ תִּהְיֶ֣ה לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם שְׁבוּ֙ וּ⁠סְחָר֔וּ⁠הָ	1	“The land is available for you {to choose what you want}; settle/live {in it} {wherever you want}. You can {also} trade {freely} here,” or “You can settle/live {wherever you want} in the land. You can also do business buying and selling things {wherever you want},” Normally foreigners were not allowed to own land or to move around in the land to trade freely. So that is why Hamor is offering this in exchange for Jacob allowing his family to intermarry with the Hivites.
34:10	b00z			וְ⁠הֵֽאָחֲז֖וּ בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	“and you can buy/own {your own} {property/land}.”

34:11	mqgb			וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר תֹּאמְר֛וּ אֵלַ֖⁠י אֶתֵּֽן	1	“Then I will give/pay {you} whatever you request/require/ask from me {for her}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
34:12	l9mr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַרְבּ֨וּ עָלַ֤⁠י מְאֹד֙ מֹ֣הַר וּ⁠מַתָּ֔ן	1	“Set the dowry/bride-price and {marriage/wedding} gifts {that I must pay} {to marry her} as high as you want,” The “dowry” was the payment that a groom (and his family) had to give to the bride’s family. It could include things like money, land, and livestock. The term “gift” probably refers to additional gifts given to the bride and her family members (as in Gen 24:53). If the custom of paying a dowry is not known in your culture, you could include an explanation in a footnote.
34:12	zoy5			וְ⁠אֶ֨תְּנָ֔ה כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר תֹּאמְר֖וּ אֵלָ֑⁠י	1	“and I will give/pay {you} whatever you request/ask/require from me.” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 11.
34:12	hr5l			וּ⁠תְנוּ לִ֥⁠י אֶת הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֖ לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	“{Just please} give the young woman to me to marry.” or “{Just/Only please} let me marry the young woman.” See how you translated “young woman” in verse 3.

34:13	vyae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁ֣ר טִמֵּ֔א אֵ֖ת דִּינָ֥ה אֲחֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	“because he/Shechem had dishonored/disgraced their sister Dinah.” or “because he/Shechem had done a shameful thing to their sister Dinah.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “But because/since Shechem had defiled/dishonored their sister Dinah, the sons of Jacob deceived/tricked Shechem and his father Hamor 14 by saying to them,” Do what is best in your language.
34:14	qc19			וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֲלֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	“and said to them,” or “They said to them,” Consider whether it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the sentence that started in verse 13.

34:14	guat			כִּֽי חֶרְפָּ֥ה הִ֖וא לָֽ⁠נוּ	1	“because that would dishonor/humiliate our family!” or “That would cause {great} shame/humiliation to our family!” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
34:15	xfgc			אַךְ בְּ⁠זֹ֖את נֵא֣וֹת לָ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“The only way that we will/can agree with your proposal {is}” or “We will/can do what you want/ask only if you do this one thing:”
34:15	u2iz			אִ֚ם תִּהְי֣וּ כָמֹ֔⁠נוּ	1	“if {first} you {and your people} become like us” or “You {and your people} must {first} become like us”
34:15	w4wh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	לְ⁠הִמֹּ֥ל לָ⁠כֶ֖ם כָּל זָכָֽר	1	“by circumcising all your males.” See how you translated “circumcised” in Gen 17:10.

Also see how you translated “give … daughters … take … daughters …” in verse 9.
34:16	v17p			וְ⁠יָשַׁ֣בְנוּ אִתְּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	“We will {also} settle/live among you {in this land},” See how you translated “settle with” in verse 10.
34:16	ijuu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	וְ⁠הָיִ֖ינוּ לְ⁠עַ֥ם אֶחָֽד	1	“so that we become one people group.” or “and as a result we will {all} be/become one people/ethnic group.” Here the “we” is inclusive because Jacob’s sons are including Shechem and Hamor’s people. If you have an inclusive form of this pronoun in your language, you could use it here.
34:17	p6xy			וְ⁠אִם לֹ֧א תִשְׁמְע֛וּ אֵלֵ֖י⁠נוּ לְ⁠הִמּ֑וֹל	1	“But/However if you refuse to agree with our requirement that you circumcise {your people/males},” or “But if you will/do not circumcise {your males} as we require/say,”
34:17	o476			וְ⁠לָקַ֥חְנוּ אֶת בִּתֵּ֖⁠נוּ וְ⁠הָלָֽכְנוּ	1	“then we will take our {father’s/family’s} daughter {from you} and go/move {somewhere else}.” or “then we will leave and take our sister with us.” The phrase “our daughter” reflects the fact that Jacob’s sons are using their father’s perspective and authority here. If that is confusing, you could say “our sister” instead. See how you translated “our {family’s} daughter” in verse 8.
34:18	jvuw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּֽיטְב֥וּ דִבְרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י חֲמ֑וֹר וּ⁠בְ⁠עֵינֵ֖י שְׁכֶ֥ם בֶּן חֲמֽוֹר	1	“What Jacob’s sons said/proposed seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.” or “Hamor and his son Shechem were pleased {and agreed to do} what Jacob’s sons said/proposed.” See how you translated the idiom “good in … eyes” in Gen 19:8. It may need to be translated in different ways, depending on the context.
34:19	hx5y			וְ⁠לֹֽא אֵחַ֤ר הַ⁠נַּ֨עַר֙	1	“So Shechem immediately started” or “So right away Shechem took action”

34:20	acum			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥א חֲמ֛וֹר וּ⁠שְׁכֶ֥ם בְּנ֖⁠וֹ אֶל־שַׁ֣עַר עִירָ֑⁠ם	1	“In fact, he/Shechem and his father Hamor went {straight/directly} to their city’s gates/entrance {for a town meeting},”
34:20	cgfe			וַֽ⁠יְדַבְּר֛וּ אֶל אַנְשֵׁ֥י עִירָ֖⁠ם לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	“and they spoke to the city elders/leaders {who had gathered there}. They said,” or “and they told the elders/leaders of their city {about Jacob and his sons},” In that culture the leaders of a city held their meetings at the main city gates (as in Gen 23:3). Cities were surrounded by walls (that had gates) for protection. You could put some of that information in a footnote so that people understand what was happening.

It may be necessary to translate these in different ways, depending on the context.
34:22	hf95			אַךְ בְּ֠⁠זֹאת יֵאֹ֨תוּ לָ֤⁠נוּ הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁים֙ לָ⁠שֶׁ֣בֶת אִתָּ֔⁠נוּ	1	“There is just one thing/condition/requirement: They will only agree to settle/live among us” or “But they will only consent/agree to settle/live among us”. See how you began verse 15, which is very similar to verse 22.
34:22	r3ez			לִ⁠הְי֖וֹת לְ⁠עַ֣ם אֶחָ֑ד	1	“and become one people group {with us}”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 16.
34:22	yesq			בְּ⁠הִמּ֥וֹל לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ כָּל זָכָ֔ר	1	“if all our males are circumcised” or “if we circumcise all our males”. See how you translated “every male among … circumcised” in verse 15.

34:23	bstj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֥וֹא לָ֖⁠נוּ הֵ֑ם	1	“will belong to us!” or “will be ours!” This rhetorical question emphasizes that all of Jacob’s livestock and property will belong to the people of Shechem. If a rhetorical question does not fit here in your language, you could make this a statement.
34:23	cpgv			אַ֚ךְ נֵא֣וֹתָה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	“{So} let’s just agree to do what they require,” or “{So} we should just do what they propose/require”

Make sure that your translation of this idiom refers here to the same men who had gathered at the city gates in verse 20.
34:24	qqoa			וַ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֤וּ אֶל חֲמוֹר֙ וְ⁠אֶל שְׁכֶ֣ם בְּנ֔⁠וֹ	1	“agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem,” or “agreed to do what Hamor and his son Shechem said,”

Some languages have a special term for this. Do what is best in your language.
34:25	nk02			חַרְבּ֔⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥אוּ עַל הָ⁠עִ֖יר בֶּ֑טַח	1	“their swords and attacked the city, with no one opposing/resisting them.” See how you translated “sword” in Gen 27:40.
34:25	g5z3			וַ⁠יַּֽהַרְג֖וּ כָּל זָכָֽר	1	“They killed all the males/men {there}”. The children who were males were probably not killed, since later (verse 29) it says that all the children were captured. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 26.
34:26	hiyf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וְ⁠אֶת חֲמוֹר֙ וְ⁠אֶת שְׁכֶ֣ם בְּנ֔⁠וֹ הָרְג֖וּ לְ⁠פִי חָ֑רֶב	1	“with their swords, including Hamor and his son Shechem.” Some languages have dual pronouns for “they” and “you” that can be used in verses 25-26 and 30-31 to refer to Simeon and Levi. Do what is best in your language.
34:26	ext8			וַ⁠יִּקְח֧וּ אֶת דִּינָ֛ה מִ⁠בֵּ֥ית שְׁכֶ֖ם	1	“Then they took/got/rescued Dinah from Shechem’s house”

34:27	iggu			אֲשֶׁ֥ר טִמְּא֖וּ אֲחוֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	“{They did that} because {that was where} Shechem had defiled/dishonored/disgraced their sister.” or “to get revenge for the shameful thing that had been done to their sister {there}.” See how you translated “defiled” in verses 5 and 13. Even though Shechem was the one who actually defiled Dinah (verses 2, 5, 7, 13), Jacob’s sons held everyone in the city responsible for the crime that their ruler’s son had committed (verses 25-29). If that is not clear, you could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of “they” does not refer to Jacob’s sons.

They also captured all their women and children.” or “They took away everything that was valuable and also captured all the children and women. They seized and took away everything that was in the houses.” See how you translated “plundered” in verse 27.

Some languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “the Canaanites” and “the Perizzites” in Gen 13:7; 15:20-21. There were other people groups also living in the land, but these two groups are the ones being emphasized here.

34:30	wg65			וְ⁠נֶאֶסְפ֤וּ עָלַ⁠י֙ וְ⁠הִכּ֔וּ⁠נִי	1	“so if they {all} join {forces} against me/us and attack me/us,” Make sure your use of the pronouns “me” or “us” fits with the way you translate the rest of this sentence.

Some languages have an idiom for this. Do what is best in your language.
35:1	b2k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“Then God told/commanded Jacob,” Translate this quote margin in a way that is natural in your language and that fits with what God says.

35:1	j11q			עֲלֵ֥ה בֵֽית אֵ֖ל וְ⁠שֶׁב שָׁ֑ם	1	“and travel to {the town of} Bethel and live there.” or “and move to {the town of} Bethel.” The verb “go up” reflects the fact that the town of Bethel is higher in elevation than the city of Shechem; it does not refer to the direction they were going, which was south. Many translations leave “up” implied (to prevent confusion). Do what is best in your language.

They were to make themselves physically clean as a sign that they were preparing themselves mentally and spiritually to worship God (as their only God) at Bethel, which was a holy place where God had met with Jacob before. Some languages may have a special word for “purify” that communicates this. Do what is best in your language. Also consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

35:3	mk28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְהִי֙ עִמָּדִ֔⁠י	1	“He has {always} been/stayed with me/us {and taken care of me/us}”. See how you translated the idiom “with me” in Gen 31:5, where it also means that God is not only present with him but also helps him and takes care of him.

35:4	qkq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הָ⁠אֵלָ֖ה	1	“the/a terebinth/oak tree”. Although this phrase refers to a terebinth tree, many translations have “oak tree” instead, or some other type of large, strong tree that is well known. See how you translated a different Hebrew word that is also translated “terebinth tree” or “oak tree” in Gen 12:6; 13:18; 14:13; 18:1. Another Hebrew word in Gen 35:8 is also translated as “oak.”

35:5	bc7c			וַ⁠יְהִ֣י חִתַּ֣ת אֱלֹהִ֗ים עַל הֶֽ⁠עָרִים֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ סְבִיבֹ֣תֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וְ⁠לֹ֣א	1	“and God caused {the people in} the surrounding/nearby cities/towns to be terrified/afraid, so that” or “and God made {the people in} the nearby cities/towns so afraid that”. The Hebrew word “Elohim” probably means “God” in this phrase (as it usually does in the Bible); most English versions translate it that way here. Or it could be an adjective that modifies “dread/terror” and means “great/deep dread/terror” (similar to Gen 23:6, 30:8). See how you translated “dread” in Gen 9:2.
35:5	xxat			וְ⁠לֹ֣א רָֽדְפ֔וּ אַחֲרֵ֖י	1	“they did not attack” or “no one attacked” or “none of them chased/came/went after”. Make sure your translation of “they” refers here to the people in the surrounding towns, not Jacob’s sons.
35:5	g7og		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּנֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1	“Jacob’s sons/family {to avenge the people of Shechem}.” or “them.” or “Jacob and his family.” Jacob’s sons are mentioned here since they are in focus as the ones who just plundered the city of Shechem; Jacob and the rest of his family were there with his sons and were also in danger.
35:6	r8n3			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב ל֗וּזָ⁠ה	1	“Then/Soon Jacob/they arrived at {the town of} Luz,” Be consistent in this verse with how you spelled “Luz” and “Bethel” in Gen 28:19.
35:6	zpbn			הִ֖וא בֵּֽית אֵ֑ל	1	“which {is also/now called/named} Bethel,” or “that {is}, Bethel,” or “which {also/now has the name} Bethel,” See how you translated “which is” in Gen 23:2, 19.
35:6	e1f7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן	1	“which is {also} in Canaan,” Since Shechem (verse 4) and Bethel were both in the land or region of Canaan, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this location phrase earlier in the verse and say, “Jacob/He and his family {continued traveling} in the land/region of Canaan and arrived at {the town of} Luz, which {also/now has the name} Bethel,” Do what is best in your language.
35:6	rsay		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ה֖וּא וְ⁠כָל הָ⁠עָ֥ם אֲשֶׁר עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	“he/Jacob and his whole/entire household/family.” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse. Do what is best in your language.
35:7	iybt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יִּ֤בֶן שָׁם֙ מִזְבֵּ֔חַ	1	“There he/Jacob built an altar,” or “Then he/Jacob built an altar there,” Consider again how you translated “altar” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 8:20; 12:7-8; 13:4, 18; 22:9; 26:25; 33:20; 35:1, 3, 7.

35:7	acaa			כִּ֣י שָׁ֗ם	1	“because that is where” or “because it was at Bethel that”
35:7	njqv			נִגְל֤וּ אֵלָי⁠ו֙ הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“God had {first} introduced himself to him/Jacob” or “God had {first} appeared to him/Jacob”. Compare how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“appeared”) in verses 1 and 9.
35:7	l3rr			בְּ⁠בָרְח֖⁠וֹ	1	“when/while he was running away”. See how you translated “fleeing” in verse 1.
35:7	ww7q			מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י אָחִֽי⁠ו	1	“from {the anger of} his brother.” or “from his brother.” See how you translated “from the presence of” in verse 1.
35:8	psgk			וַ⁠תָּ֤מָת דְּבֹרָה֙ מֵינֶ֣קֶת רִבְקָ֔ה	1	“Then {while they were still in Bethel,} Rebekah’s {former} nurse/nanny Deborah died” or “{While they were there,} Deborah died. She was the servant who had helped raise {Jacob’s mother} Rebekah {when she was young}.” See how you translated “nurse” in Gen 24:59.
35:8	cnph			וַ⁠תִּקָּבֵ֛ר	1	“and {her body} was buried {by Jacob} {in the ground}” or “They/Jacob buried her {body} {in the ground}”
35:8	gwdm			מִ⁠תַּ֥חַת לְ⁠בֵֽית אֵ֖ל	1	“{in the valley} below/near {the town of} Bethel,” or “{at a place} south of {the town of} Bethel,” The town of Bethel was built on a hill, so the phrase “below Bethel” means that Deborah was buried near Bethel, in a valley or place that was lower in elevation than the town, and possibly to the south of it.
35:8	h6bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	תַּ֣חַת הָֽ⁠אַלּ֑וֹן	1	“beside the/an oak tree” or “at the foot/base of an oak tree.” See how you translated a similar phrase (“under the terebinth/oak tree”) in verse 4. Many translations translate this phrase the same way in both places (“under an oak tree”), even though different Hebrew words are used for the type of tree. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put this phrase before the previous phrase and say, “at the base of an oak tree, below/near {the town of} Bethel.” Do what is best in your language.
35:8	eqj9			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	“So he/they named the tree/place” or “That is why the/that place is known as”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) that people in general called the tree or place Allon Bacuth; or (2) that Jacob was the one who named the place. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 31:38.
35:8	iar1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אַלּ֥וֹן בָּכֽוּת	1	“Allon Bacuth, {which means “oak tree of weeping/mourning.”}” or “Allon Bacuth, {which means “oak tree where people mourn.”}” If you include the meaning of this name in your translation text or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translated “oak tree” in the previous sentence.

35:9	w0t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתֽ⁠וֹ	1	“and blessed him” or “and showed his goodness/kindness toward him” or “God blessed him”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.
35:10	q9rk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמֶר ל֥⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	“and said to him,” or “by saying to him,” What God says to Jacob in verses 10-12 is the blessing. So make sure your translation of “blessed” (verse 9) and “said” (verse 10) refers to the same event, not two separate events. See how you translated “blessed … and said” in Gen 1:28.
35:10	bpj9			שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	“{Although} your name {has been} Jacob,” Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like God was telling Jacob something he did not know.
35:10	qyzi			לֹֽא יִקָּרֵא֩ שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֨ ע֜וֹד יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	“that will no longer be your {only} name,” or “it will no longer be Jacob/that,” Notice that Jacob is referred to by both of his names in this chapter (“Jacob” in verses 11-20, 22-29; “Israel” in verses 10 and 21). You could put that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated this clause in Gen 32:28, and see the note about Jacob’s names there.
35:10	nvm1			כִּ֤י אִם יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	“Rather, your name will {also} be Israel!” or “Rather, you will {also} have the name Israel!” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
35:10	kx9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א אֶת שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	“So {once again} God gave Jacob the name Israel.” This was not the first time God had given Jacob the name Israel (See: Gen 32:28). To make that clear, you could make “once again” explicit here.
35:11	ni4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ ל֨⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	“Then God {also} said to him/Jacob,” or “Then God {also} {blessed him/Jacob by} saying,” or “God continued {blessing him/Jacob by} saying to him,” In verse 11, God continues the blessing that he started in verse 10, perhaps after a pause.
35:11	k8l5			אֲנִ֨י אֵ֤ל שַׁדַּי֙	1	“I {am} Almighty God.” or “I {am} God {who is} all-powerful.” See how you translated the title “God Almighty” in Gen 17:1 and 28:3.
35:11	mdi4			פְּרֵ֣ה	1	“Have many children”. Consider again how you translated “Be fruitful and multiply” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 1:22, 28; 8:17; 9:1, 7; 35:11. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
35:11	ko42			וּ⁠רְבֵ֔ה	1	“and increase {in number}.” or “so that you {and your descendants} become {very} numerous/many.”
35:11	uzb9			גּ֛וֹי וּ⁠קְהַ֥ל גּוֹיִ֖ם יִהְיֶ֣ה מִמֶּ֑⁠ךָּ	1	“{Your descendants will become} a {large} people/ethnic group. In fact, many people/ethnic groups will come/descend from you,” or “Your descendants will become many people/ethnic groups,” Compare how you translated a similar phrase (“a multitude of nations”) in Gen 17:4-5 and another similar phrase (“a community of peoples”) in Gen 28:3.
35:11	ztcs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וּ⁠מְלָכִ֖ים מֵ⁠חֲלָצֶ֥י⁠ךָ יֵצֵֽאוּ	1	“and kings will come/descend from you.” or “and some of your descendants will be kings.” The phrase “come from your loins” is an idiom that refers to having children, grandchildren and other descendants. Consider whether you have a similar idiom in your language.
35:12	wfzz			וְ⁠אֶת הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֛תִּי לְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֥ם וּ⁠לְ⁠יִצְחָ֖ק לְ⁠ךָ֣ אֶתְּנֶ֑⁠נָּה וּֽ⁠לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֥ אַחֲרֶ֖י⁠ךָ אֶתֵּ֥ן אֶת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“{Besides that,} the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I {also} give to you and your descendants {who live} after you.” or “Also, I am giving to you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, and I will {also} give it to your descendants {who live} after you.”

35:14	apyn			וַ⁠יַּצֵּ֨ב יַעֲקֹ֜ב מַצֵּבָ֗ה	1	“Then Jacob set/stood a {large} stone up {on its end}” or “Then Jacob took/chose a {large} stone {that was there} and set/stood it up {on its end}”. See how you translated a similar passage in Gen 28:18 about Jacob setting up a memorial stone pillar.
35:14	vufy			בַּ⁠מָּק֛וֹם אֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּ֖⁠וֹ מַצֶּ֣בֶת אָ֑בֶן	1	“at the place where God had spoken/talked to him, to mark the place {as special}.” or “as a memorial stone to remember the place where God had spoken/talked to him.”

See how you translated “poured oil on …” in Gen 28:18.
35:15	r8mu			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב אֶת שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מָּק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁר֩ דִּבֶּ֨ר אִתּ֥⁠וֹ שָׁ֛ם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בֵּֽית אֵֽל	1	“Then Jacob called/named that place Bethel, {which means “house of God,”} because God had spoken/talked to him there.” or “Since God had spoken/talked to Jacob at that place, Jacob named it Bethel, {which means “God’s house.”}” See how you translated “called the name of that place Bethel” in Gen 28:19.
35:16	zgdt			וַ⁠יִּסְעוּ֙ מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אֵ֔ל	1	“Then they left {the town of} Bethel” or “Later Jacob and his family moved on from {the town of} Bethel”. Be consistent here with how you spelled “Bethel” throughout the book of Genesis and whether you refer to it as a town or a city. See Gen 12:8; 13:3; 28:19; 31:13; 35:1, 3, 7, 15, 16.
35:16	pluk			וַֽ⁠יְהִי ע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ לָ⁠ב֣וֹא אֶפְרָ֑תָה	1	“and started {heading} toward {the town of} Ephrath. But while they were still a distance away from there,” or “and headed for {the town of} Ephrath. While they were still some distance from there,” The phrase “a distance of land” is very general, but your translation should not make it sound like the distance was too far, because Rachel’s grave is about two kilometers (one mile) from Ephrath (Bethlehem).
35:16	xn8j			וַ⁠תֵּ֥לֶד רָחֵ֖ל	1	“{Jacob’s/his wife} Rachel, {who was pregnant,} began to have labor/childbirth pains,” or “Rachel went into labor,”
35:16	hid6			וַ⁠תְּקַ֥שׁ בְּ⁠לִדְתָּֽ⁠הּ	1	“but she was having a very difficult time delivering the baby.” or “but she was experiencing great difficulty.”
35:17	lkqs			וַ⁠יְהִ֥י בְ⁠הַקְשֹׁתָ֖⁠הּ בְּ⁠לִדְתָּ֑⁠הּ	1	“Then when her labor pain was at its worst,” or “Then when she was at the most difficult/painful point/time in her labor,” or “Then when her labor/childbirth pains were the most severe,” The phrase “hard labor” refers to when childbirth contractions are close together and very painful, often right before a baby is born.
35:17	ojel			וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר לָ֤⁠הּ הַ⁠מְיַלֶּ֨דֶת֙	1	“the midwife told her,” or “{the baby was born and} the midwife/woman who was helping her deliver exclaimed to her,”

35:17	uww0			כִּֽי גַם זֶ֥ה לָ֖⁠ךְ בֵּֽן	1	“You {now} have another son/boy!” or “You {just} gave birth to another son/boy!”
35:18	ob0k			וַ⁠יְהִ֞י בְּ⁠צֵ֤את נַפְשָׁ⁠הּ֙ כִּ֣י מֵ֔תָה	1	“But Rachel was dying, and as her soul/spirit was leaving her body,” or “But {in fact/reality,} Rachel was about to die, and just/right before her soul/spirit left her,” Some translations use an idiom here, for example, “as she was taking her last breath” or “as her life was slipping/fading away”, but it is best to translate this in a way that preserves the biblical teaching that at death the soul or spirit leaves the body.
35:18	lpc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠תִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ בֶּן אוֹנִ֑י	1	“she named her baby {boy} Benoni, {which means “son of my sorrow/trouble.”}” The meaning of this name could imply that the child caused Rachel’s death. In the Hebrew text this name is two words connected with a dash (“Ben-oni”). Many translations write it that way or as one word (“Benoni”), and a few translations write it as “Ben Oni.” Any of these spellings is fine.
35:18	yl7o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אָבִ֖י⁠ו	1	“But {later,} his father {Jacob}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this phrase refers to Jacob. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
35:18	qoiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קָֽרָא ל֥⁠וֹ בִנְיָמִֽין	1	“named him Benjamin {instead}.” or “changed his name to Benjamin, {which means “son of my right hand.”}” The phrase “son of my right hand” is an idiom that means “favored son” or “son of strength.”
35:19	z9dg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תָּ֖מָת רָחֵ֑ל וַ⁠תִּקָּבֵר֙	1	“After Rachel died, her body was buried {by Jacob}” or “After Rachel died, they/Jacob buried her {body}”. See how you translated “was buried” in verse 8.
35:19	u8c3			בְּ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔תָה	1	“beside/near the road {that goes} to {the town of} Ephrath,”
35:19	v561			הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	“which {is also called/named} Bethlehem.” or “which {also has the name} Bethlehem.” or “that {is}, Bethlehem.” See how you translated a similar phrase (“which is Bethel”) in verse 6.
35:20	zolc			וַ⁠יַּצֵּ֧ב יַעֲקֹ֛ב מַצֵּבָ֖ה	1	“Jacob set/stood a {large} stone up {on its end}”. See how you translated this clause in verse 14. Also consider again how you translated “set up” and “pillar” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 28:18, 22; 31:13, 45, 51, 52; 35:14, 20.
35:20	tkgx			עַל קְבֻרָתָ֑⁠הּ	1	“over/on her burial place {to mark/show where it was}.” or “to mark/show {where} her grave/tomb {was}.” or “to mark the place where they/he had buried her body.”
35:20	xjy1			הִ֛וא מַצֶּ֥בֶת קְבֻֽרַת רָחֵ֖ל	1	“{In fact,} that {same} pillar/stone still marks Rachel’s/her grave/tomb”
35:20	r7ta			עַד הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	“to/in the present day.” or “today/now.” The phrase “to this day” refers to the time when the author (Moses) was living. Even in modern times, Rachel’s grave is still marked beside the road about eight kilometers (five miles) south of Jerusalem and two kilometers (one mile) north of Bethlehem.
35:21	e4g9			וַ⁠יִּסַּ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	“Then Israel {that is, Jacob,} {and his family} moved on {from there}” or “Then Israel {and his family} started traveling again”. Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that “Israel” (verses 21-22) and “Jacob” (verses 20, 22) refer to the same person, not two different people.
35:21	sykf			וַ⁠יֵּ֣ט אָֽהֳלֹ֔⁠ה	1	“and set/put up his/their tents”
35:21	fueh			מֵ⁠הָ֖לְאָה	1	“on the other/south side of”. This phrase reflects the perspective of Jacob, who was traveling south.
35:21	txka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	לְ⁠מִגְדַּל עֵֽדֶר	1	“the tower of Eder.” or “Eder Tower.” Many translations transliterate “Migdal Eder” (like most other names). Many others translate the meaning of “Migdal” as “the tower” and transliterate “Eder.” A few translate the meaning of the entire name as “the Tower of the Flock.” This was apparently a place near Bethlehem where sheep were raised (Micah 4:8); shepherds may have watched over their flocks from the tower.
35:22	ls6b			וַ⁠יְהִ֗י בִּ⁠שְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	“While Israel {and his family} were {still} living/staying” or “During the time that they were living/staying”

Translate this idiom in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud in public. See how you translated “lain with” in Gen 26:10.
35:22	ivkl			בִּלְהָה֙ פִּילֶ֣גֶשׁ אָבִ֔י⁠ו	1	“his father’s concubine/servant-wife Bilhah,”

See Gen 12:16, 16:1-3, 5-6, 8; 20:14; 24:35; 25:12; 29:24, 29; 30:4, 7, 9-10, 12, 18, 43; 32:5, 22; 33:1-2, 6; 35:25-26. It may be necessary to translate this word in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Compare that to how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“slave/servant woman”); see Gen 31:33 for a list of where this word occurs in Genesis.

35:26	cmuu			בְּ⁠פַדַּ֥ן אֲרָֽם	1	“{starting from the time that he lived} in {the region of} Paddan Aram.” Jacob started having children during the time he was living with Laban in Paddan Aram, but his last son Benjamin was not born until after they had left there (verse 18). Translate this in a way that allows for that.

The region of Edom and the Edomites were named after Esau, which is probably why this chapter repeatedly mentions that Esau is Edom.

Only the first two wives mentioned in this chapter were Canaanites; see the comment about Basemath at verse 3. The Canaanites were the descendants of Noah’s grandson Canaan (Ham’s son) and included the Hittites and Hivites (verse 2; Genesis 10:15-18) and several other people groups. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
36:2	ox2j			אֶת עָדָ֗ה	1	“{whose names were} Adah,” or “{Their names were} Adah,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

See how you translated “Hittites” in Gen 27:46.
36:2	y896			וְ⁠אֶת אָהֳלִֽיבָמָה֙	1	“and {also} Oholibamah,” or “as well as Oholibamah,” Notice that the names of Esau’s two Canaanite wives here are different from the names of his wives mentioned in Gen 26:34. It could be that they each had two names, or these may be different wives that he married later.
36:2	eq37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בַּת עֲנָ֔ה בַּת	1	“{who was} Anah’s daughter {and} the {grand}daughter of” or “whose father was Anah and whose grandfather was”. Notice that Elon, Anah, and Zibeon are the names of men here, not women.

Consider again how you translated “Hivites” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:17; 34:2; 36:2.
36:3	x22q			וְ⁠אֶת בָּשְׂמַ֥ת	1	“{Esau also married} Basemath,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Since this Basemath was a daughter of Ishmael (who was a descendant of Noah’s son Shem), she was not a Canaanite, in contrast to Esau’s first two wives (verse 2). She was also known as Mahalath (Gen 28:9); you could include some of that information in a footnote. Be consistent here with how you spelled Basemath (a different woman with the same name) in Gen 26:34.
36:3	sd2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	בַּת יִשְׁמָעֵ֖אל אֲח֥וֹת נְבָיֽוֹת	1	“{who was} Ishmael’s daughter {and} Nebaioth’s {younger} sister.” or “whose father was Ishmael and whose {older} brother was Nebaioth.” Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child (Gen 25:13), Basemath (Mahalath) was his younger sister, probably from the same mother. Use a kinship term here in your language that fits with those facts. See how you translated “the sister of Nebaioth” in Gen 28:9.

He took {with him} his wives …” Do what is best in your language.
36:7	pq8b			כִּֽי	1	“{He/Esau did that} because” or “The reason {he/Esau moved away} is that”

Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to both Esau and Jacob’s livestock, not just Esau’s.
36:7	zea4			אֶ֤רֶץ מְגֽוּרֵי⁠הֶם֙	1	“The land where they were staying/living”. See how you translated Gen 13:6, which is similar in content to this verse.

So Esau took his wives …” If you do this in your translation, you should label these verses as “6-7”.
36:8	lcin			וַ⁠יֵּ֤שֶׁב עֵשָׂו֙	1	“That is why/how Esau {and his family}” or “That is the reason Esau {took his family and}”

Here he moves to the part of that region that had mountains. To make that clear, you could put that information in a footnote.

See Gen 5:1, 10:1, 11:10, 25:12, 36:9. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

36:22	exa7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	וַ⁠אֲח֥וֹת לוֹטָ֖ן תִּמְנָֽע	1	“and {the name of} his sister {was} Timna.” or “Lotan’s sister {was} Timna.” or “Lotan was also Timna’s brother.” Timna became a concubine of Esau’s son Eliphaz (verse 12). This genealogy (verses 20-22) also shows that she was the daughter of Chief Seir (since her brother Lotan was the son of Chief Seir). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also, according to Jewish history outside the Bible, Timna was Lotan’s younger sister. If your language has a special term for “younger sister” or “older brother,” you could use one of those here.

Most translations follow the Hebrew text and have “Hadar” here. Some translations (and ancient versions such as SP, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate) have “Hadad” here instead, in order to spell this name the same way it is spelled in 1 Chronicles 1:50-51. However, that could cause confusion, because “Hadad” is also the name of a different king in verses 35-36 above.
36:39	aq30			וַ⁠יִּמְלֹ֤ךְ תַּחְתָּי⁠ו֙	1	“took his place as king” or “replaced/succeeded him as king”. Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 33-39.

Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up this long sentence into two shorter sentences.
36:40	ynzj			אַלּ֥וּף תִּמְנָ֛ע אַלּ֥וּף עַֽלְוָ֖ה אַלּ֥וּף יְתֵֽת	1	“Timna, Alvan, Jetheth,” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. (1) Most translations treat all the names in verses 40-43 as the names of chiefs (as in the ULT and UST of these verses). (2) However, some scholars think that all the names in verses 40-43 are the names of regions or clans and say, “{These are/were} {the names of} the clans/tribes {that descended} from Esau. Each clan/tribe lived {in the land of Edom} in its own region that was named after that clan/tribe. {The names of the clans/tribes} were TImna, Alvan … Iram.

37:1	r483			וַ⁠יֵּ֣שֶׁב יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“Now Jacob was {still} living” or “Jacob continued to live”. Chapter 37 continues the history about Jacob that left off at the end of chapter 35. Begin this chapter in a way that is natural in your language. Make sure the way you translate “lived” allows for the fact that Jacob was already living in Canaan and had settled near the city of Hebron, where his father and grandfather had lived previously (Gen 35:27).
37:1	u237			בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ מְגוּרֵ֣י אָבִ֑י⁠ו בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן	1	“in the land/region of Canaan where his father {Isaac} had lived for a while {as a foreigner/outsider}.” See how you translated “sojourned” in Gen 35:27 and “the land of Canaan” in Gen 35:6.

See Gen 2:4; 6:9; 11:27; 25:19; 36:1; 37:2, where what follows is a narrative or history of events. Compare that to Gen 5:1; 10:1; 11:10; 25:12; 36:9, where what follows is more of a genealogy (list of names). It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
37:2	hh9m			יוֹסֵ֞ף בֶּן שְׁבַֽע עֶשְׂרֵ֤ה שָׁנָה֙	1	“{One day} {his} seventeen-year-old son Joseph” or “{Jacob’s/His son} Joseph, who was seventeen years old,” This verse may be referring to a single incident or it may be referring to what happened regularly.

37:2	xjuz			אֶת אֶחָי⁠ו֙ & וְ⁠ה֣וּא נַ֗עַר אֶת	1	“as an assistant/helper for his brothers {who were}” or “Joseph was helping his brothers {who were}”. As the youngest of these brothers, Joseph was their helper as they took care of their father’s flocks.

Also, make sure your translation of “their father” does not sound like the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah had a different father than Joseph had.
37:3	tws4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	“Now {Jacob, whose other name was} Israel,” or “Israel, {that is, Jacob,}” This verse introduces background information for the events that happen next. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that Jacob (verse 1) and Israel (verse 3) refer to the same person, not two separate people. For a note about this, see Gen 35:10.
37:3	tzuu			אָהַ֤ב אֶת יוֹסֵף֙ מִ⁠כָּל בָּנָ֔י⁠ו	1	“loved Joseph more than any of his {other} sons”

37:3	ruov		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠עָ֥שָׂה ל֖⁠וֹ כְּתֹ֥נֶת פַּסִּֽים	1	“So he/Israel/Jacob made a {special/beautiful} tunic/robe for him/Joseph that had many colors.” or “So he/Israel/Jacob made a {special} colorful tunic/robe for him/Joseph.” The meaning of the Hebrew text is not certain here. Many translations (including the Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate) say that the tunic or robe was “multicolored” or “colorful.” This “tunic” was probably full-length to the ankles and had long sleeves that reached to the hands.
37:4	j9s1			וַ⁠יִּרְא֣וּ אֶחָ֗י⁠ו כִּֽי אֹת֞⁠וֹ אָהַ֤ב אֲבִי⁠הֶם֙ מִ⁠כָּל אֶחָ֔י⁠ו	1	“Joseph’s brothers saw/realized that their father loved him/Joseph more than any of {the rest of} his sons, so” or “When Joseph’s brothers saw/realized that their father loved him/Joseph more than the rest of them,”

37:7	kj3d			אֲנַ֜חְנוּ מְאַלְּמִ֤ים אֲלֻמִּים֙ בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	“that we {all} were out in the middle of a field {cutting stalks of grain/wheat and} tying the stalks into sheaves/bundles.” or “us {working together} out in a field {cutting and} tying sheaves/bundles {of grain/wheat stalks}.” A sheaf of grain is a bunch of grain stalks that have been cut and tied together in a bundle, with the heads of grain at the top. Wheat and barley were the grains that were common in this region at that time, not corn or oats.
37:7	hdur			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֛ה	1	“Then suddenly”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
37:7	i9yf			אֲלֻמָּתִ֖⁠י	1	“my sheaf/bundle {of grain/wheat}” or “the sheaf/bundle that I had made”
37:7	t8q7			קָ֥מָה & וְ⁠גַם נִצָּ֑בָה	1	“stood up straight.” or “stood up on its end”

37:8	l93b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠מָלֹ֤ךְ	1	“Do you really expect to” or “Certainly you don’t think you will” or “You will never”. The brothers use two rhetorical questions in this verse to express their disagreement with Joseph and to emphasize that they are not happy with him. Do what is best in your language.
37:8	r10j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	תִּמְלֹךְ֙ עָלֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	“reign over us!” or “be our king!” For languages that mark inclusive and exclusive pronouns, “us” excludes Joseph in this sentence.

37:8	xn5l			וַ⁠יּוֹסִ֤פוּ עוֹד֙ שְׂנֹ֣א אֹת֔⁠וֹ	1	“So they hated/despised him even more {strongly/intensely} {than they did before}”. Consider again how you translated “hate” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 24:60; 26:27; 29:31, 33; 37:4-5, 8. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
37:8	hwgw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל חֲלֹמֹתָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠עַל דְּבָרָֽי⁠ו	1	“for his dreams and for what he told them about the/his dreams.” or “because of what he had said {to them} about his dreams.” For some languages, it is more natural to switch the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “So because of what he/Joseph had told them about his dreams, his brothers hated him even more {strongly/intensely} {than they did before}.” Do what is best in your language.

37:9	utc0			מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֖ים	1	“were bowing down {to the ground}” or “bowed down {to the ground}”. See how you translated “bowed down” in verse 7.
37:9	qq77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לִֽ⁠י	1	“to/before me {to show respect}.” or “in front of me {to honor me}.” Bowing down to someone was a way of showing respect and honor to that person. If that is not clear in your culture, you could make that information explicit in your translation or in a footnote. If it is understood, you can leave it implied (as the Hebrew text does).
37:10	sa4l			וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֣ר אֶל אָבִי⁠ו֮ וְ⁠אֶל אֶחָי⁠ו֒	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Verse 10 could refer to: (1) a second time that Joseph told his dream; for example, “Then/Later Joseph told {the same dream} to {both} his father and his brothers, but his father …” or (2) the same time that he told this dream to his brothers in verse 9; for example, “When Joseph related/told {the dream} to his father and his brothers, his father …”

37:10	epfz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מָ֛ה הַ⁠חֲל֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר חָלָ֑מְתָּ	1	“That {is} a strange dream that you had!” or “Your dream {is} ridiculous/outrageous!” Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to show that he is not happy about Joseph’s dream. Decide the best way to translate this in your language.

See how you translated a similar rhetorical question in verse 8.
37:10	octg			נָב֗וֹא & לְ⁠הִשְׁתַּחֲוֺ֥ת & אָֽרְצָ⁠ה	1	“come {to you} and bow down to the ground” or “bow down”. See how you translated “bow down” in verse 7.

Israel uses a rhetorical question to remind Joseph of something he already knows and to introduce what he wants Joseph to do. Decide the best way to communicate this in your language.
37:13	vka6			בִּ⁠שְׁכֶ֔ם	1	“near {the city of} Shechem.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 12.

37:14	opy9			מֵ⁠עֵ֣מֶק חֶבְר֔וֹן	1	“from {their home in} the valley near {the city of} Hebron,” Be consistent in how you spell “Hebron” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:18; 23:2, 19; 35:27; 37:14.
37:14	jkus			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א שְׁכֶֽמָ⁠ה	1	“and he/Joseph went/traveled to {the city of} Shechem.” The trip from the city of Hebron to the city of Shechem was about 100 kilometers (60 miles).

In this context “found” means the man happened to meet Joseph as Joseph was walking around looking for his brothers; the man was not intentionally looking for him. Also, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “He started wandering around {searching} in the fields {near there}, where/and he met a man who asked …” or “As he was wandering around {searching} in the fields {near there}, he met a man who asked …” Do what is best in your language.
37:15	syph			תֹעֶ֖ה בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה וַ⁠יִּשְׁאָלֵ֧⁠הוּ הָ⁠אִ֛ישׁ לֵ⁠אמֹ֖ר	1	“searching around in the {nearby} fields/countryside and asked him”. The word “fields” refers here to large, open places with no fences and few trees, where sheep and goats could easily graze.
37:15	fnn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	מַה תְּבַקֵּֽשׁ	1	“What/Who are you looking for?” or “what/who he was looking for.” Consider whether it is better to use a direct or an indirect quote here in your language.

It was wide at the bottom and had a small opening at the top. The sides of the hole were covered with plaster so that it would hold water.

37:22	qril		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֣ם רְאוּבֵן֮	1	“Then Reuben/he continued/added,” Some translations do not include this phrase, possibly because Reuben is still speaking to the same people. However, he may have paused between verses 21 and 22 to see the effect of what he said in verse 21. Also, the repeated quote margin helps emphasize what he says in verse 22. Do what is best in your language.

37:22	lhby			וְ⁠יָ֖ד אַל תִּשְׁלְחוּ ב֑⁠וֹ	1	“but you must not harm him {in any way}.” The phrase “lay a hand on” is an idiom that emphasizes that they are not to harm him at all, not even in the smallest way.

Also, be consistent here with how you spelled “Gilead” in Gen 31:21, 23, 25.
37:25	mpjz			וּ⁠גְמַלֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם נֹֽשְׂאִ֗ים	1	“Their camels were loaded with”. Consider again how you translated “camel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:16 (and note); 24:10-11, 14, 19-20, 22, 25, 30-32, 35, 44, 46, 61, 63-64; 30:43; 31:17, 18, 34; 32:7, 15; 37:25.
37:25	duc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknowns	נְכֹאת֙ וּ⁠צְרִ֣י וָ⁠לֹ֔ט	1	“{expensive} spices, healing resin/salve and incense”. Gilead was a mountainous region east of the Jordan River that was famous as a source of balm (or balsam), which was a rare tree resin that was used for perfume and for medicine. Myrrh was another type of tree resin that was used as incense and as medicine. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

See how you translated a similar idiom (“my bone and my flesh”) in Gen 29:14.
37:27	pxd0			וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֖וּ אֶחָֽי⁠ו	1	“Judah’s brothers agreed {with him}.” or “Judah’s brothers agreed {to do what Judah had proposed/suggested}.” See how you translated “listened” in Gen 34:24.

However, sometimes (as here) the names of those people groups are used interchangeably for the same people (also see Judges 8:22, 24, 26). Perhaps that was because the two people groups had intermarried. Or there may have been merchants from the two people groups in this caravan who bought and sold Joseph together. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

Twenty shekels of silver was equal to about one-fourth of a kilo (half a pound) and was the average price for a slave. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

37:30	hksj			הַ⁠יֶּ֣לֶד	1	“The lad/youth” or “Joseph” or “Our {younger} brother”. Joseph was seventeen years old (verse 2), so this phrase should be translated in a way that is appropriate for his older brother to refer to him here. See how you translated a different word that has a similar meaning in Gen 21:12.
37:30	hm3x			אֵינֶ֔⁠נּוּ	1	“is gone/missing!”

Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.

37:32	cghp			זֹ֣את מָצָ֑אנוּ הַכֶּר נָ֗א	1	“We found this {tunic/robe}. Please look at it {to see/determine}”. See how you translated “examine” in Gen 31:32.

If this custom is not familiar in your culture, you could put that information in a footnote.

37:35	wdyn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כִּֽי אֵרֵ֧ד אֶל בְּנִ֛⁠י אָבֵ֖ל שְׁאֹ֑לָ⁠ה	1	“{No,} I will continue to mourn until I {die and} join my son down in Sheol.” or “{No,} I will continue to mourn {for my son} until I {die and} go down to be with him in the afterworld.” Sheol is the Hebrew name for the world of the dead, that is, the place where the spirits of dead people lived. You could put that information in a footnote. Your translation of “Sheol” should not refer to hell or a place of punishment. Some translations have “the grave” here, but that leaves out the idea of an afterlife that this sentence implies.
37:35	qt95			וַ⁠יֵּ֥בְךְּ אֹת֖⁠וֹ אָבִֽי⁠ו	1	“So/Then Joseph’s father continued to mourn/grieve {deeply} for him/Joseph.”

The word “Adullamite” refers to the fact that Hirah was from the town of Adullam; it is not the name of a people group. The town of Adullam was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the city of Hebron (37:14), and was lower in elevation, which is why the text says that Judah “went down” to get there.
38:1	woam			וּ⁠שְׁמ֥⁠וֹ חִירָֽה	1	“whose name {was} Hirah.”

38:2	n4av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּקָּחֶ֖⁠הָ	1	“and he took her {as his wife}.” or “and he married her.” See how you translated a similar idiom (“took a wife”) in Gen 25:1.

38:5	l4tz			וְ⁠הָיָ֥ה בִ⁠כְזִ֖יב בְּ⁠לִדְתָּ֥⁠הּ אֹתֽ⁠וֹ	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “He/Judah was in/at {the town of} Kezib when she gave birth to Shelah.” or “When she gave birth to Shelah, Judah was in {the town of} Kezib.” or (2) “It was in {the town of} Kezib that she gave birth to him/Shelah.” or “She was in Kezib when she gave birth to him/Shelah.”

38:7	roio			וַ⁠יְהִ֗י עֵ֚ר בְּכ֣וֹר יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	“But Judah’s firstborn/oldest son Er” or “But Er”. Some languages leave “the firstborn of Judah” implied here since Er was already called the firstborn in verse 6. The Hebrew text repeats that information here to emphasize Er’s relationship to Judah in the following events. Do what is best in your language.
38:7	unv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י & רַ֖ע בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	“did things that were evil/wicked in Yahweh’s sight/opinion,” or “did something/things that Yahweh considered/judged to be evil/wicked,” The Hebrew text does not specify what Er had done wrong, so neither should your translation. See how you translated the idiom “in the eyes of Yahweh” in Gen 6:8.
38:7	gnk5			וַ⁠יְמִתֵ֖⁠הוּ יְהוָֽה	1	“so Yahweh took his life.” or “so Yahweh caused him to die.”

38:8	id8g			בֹּ֛א אֶל אֵ֥שֶׁת אָחִ֖י⁠ךָ	1	“Marry your brother’s wife/widow {Tamar} {according to our custom}”. The Israelites practiced the custom of Levirate marriage, which meant that if a man died without any children, it was his oldest brother’s duty to marry his widow so that together they could have a son who would carry on the deceased man’s family line and inherit his estate (See: [Deuteronomy 25:5-6](../deu/25/05.md)). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like Judah had already arrived at Timnah, because he does not actually reach there until verse 19. His trip from the town of Adullam (verse 1) to the town of Timnah was about 13 kilometers (8 miles).
38:12	fh0g			עַל גֹּֽזֲזֵ֤י צֹאנ⁠וֹ֙	1	“{to work} with {the men} who were shearing his sheep {there}.” or “where {his men} were shearing his sheep {for him}.” See how you translated “shear his sheep” in Gen 31:19 and see the note about that there.

See Gen 4:1 (and note), 17, 25; 19:8; 24:16; 38:26. It may be necessary to translate 38:26 differently, since the relationship in this verse was outside of marriage. Compare how you translated a related idiom (“went to”) in verse 18.

Decide the best way to communicate this in your language.
38:29	fwgm			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	“So they named him” or “That is why he was named”. Although this phrase could mean that Judah (Perez’s father) named Perez, most translations translate this in a general or indefinite way that does not specify who named him.

Make sure your translation does not sound like Joseph was taken to Egypt twice or sold to Potiphar twice.

Potiphar {was} {one of} Pharaoh’s officials/officers, the captain over the king’s {personal} guards.” Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “Ishmaelites” in Gen 37:25, 27-28.
39:2	qfkq			וַ⁠יְהִ֤י יְהוָה֙ אֶת יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	“But Yahweh was with Joseph {and helped/blessed him},” See how you translated “was with” in Gen 21:20; 26:28.

In verses 2 through 20, Potiphar is referred to as Joseph’s master (verses 2-3, 7-8, 16, 19-20) and “the Egyptian” (verse 5); he is no longer mentioned by his name in the Hebrew text. Some translations continue to use Potiphar’s name occasionally in verses 2 through 20 to prevent confusion and make it clear that all of these references refer to the same person, not two or three different people. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “master” or “owner” in Gen 24:9-10.
39:3	o1le			וְ⁠כֹל֙ אֲשֶׁר ה֣וּא עֹשֶׂ֔ה יְהוָ֖ה מַצְלִ֥יחַ בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	“and was helping/enabling him/Joseph to succeed/prosper in everything that he did.” or “and was helping/enabling him/Joseph to do everything very well.” See how you translated “successful” in verse 2.

Also see how you translated the idiom “gave … into the hand of” in Gen 32:16.

It is repeated in verse 5 in the Hebrew text to emphasize the authority that Joseph was given. Do what is natural in your language.

Make sure it is clear in your translation of this chapter that “Egyptian,” “master,” and “Potiphar” all refer to the same person, not two or three different people.

Do what is best in your language. Also, Potiphar did more than decide what to eat; that was just one example of personal decisions which were all he had to concern himself with.

39:9	zepl			אֵינֶ֨⁠נּוּ גָד֜וֹל בַּ⁠בַּ֣יִת הַ⁠זֶּה֮ מִמֶּ⁠נִּי֒	1	“{so that} he has no one in his household who has more authority than I do.” or “{As a result,} {even} he does not exercise more authority in/over this/his household than I do”. As Joseph’s master, Potiphar still had more authority than Joseph. But he had given Joseph authority to act in his place over everything in his household. Try to make that clear in your translation. Also, consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin verse 9 with a new sentence or to continue the sentence from verse 8.

Some languages must translate this in a way that does not use a negative word such as “not”. Do what is best in your language.

Do what is best in your language.

The phrase “Then/And it happened” is used several times in this chapter (verses 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19) to introduce and emphasize important events and to increase suspense so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Many English translations have omitted this phrase, possibly for reasons of naturalness. Consider whether you have an expression like this that is natural in your language.

Rather, it came off in her hands as he was fleeing.

Potiphar probably had soldiers arrest Joseph for him, since he had the authority to do that as the captain of the guards. Consider again how you referred to Joseph and Joseph’s master, Potiphar, in verses 1-20. As usual, after you finish translating a section like this, it is a good practice to read the section aloud at a normal pace and listen carefully to make sure you refer to everyone accurately and naturally at each point in the text.

The chief cupbearer was one of Pharaoh’s most trusted servants. He was in charge of serving Pharaoh anything that he wanted to drink, especially wine. It was his job to test the drink before Pharaoh had some, to make sure it was high quality and not poisoned. Some of that information could be put in a footnote. Also, it may be more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that these were the head officials in these jobs, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language.

Do what is best in your language.
40:3	sdsb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֨ן אֹתָ֜⁠ם	1	“So he had them {arrested and} put” or “So he {had his soldiers arrest them and} put them”. Often in the Bible (as here), when it says that a king (or someone else with authority) did something, it is implied that he had people who were under his authority actually do it. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 39:20.
40:3	dfne			בְּ⁠מִשְׁמַ֗ר	1	“under guard” or “in prison”
40:3	e6e3			בֵּ֛ית שַׂ֥ר הַ⁠טַבָּחִ֖ים	1	“in/at the house of the captain of/over the guards,” Apparently the round-house prison was part of the house where the chief of the guards lived and worked, perhaps a lower part (See: Joseph’s use of the word “pit” in verse 15 to refer to this prison). See how you translated “chief/captain of the guards” in Gen 37:36 and 39:1.
40:3	yw2r			אֶל בֵּ֣ית הַ⁠סֹּ֑הַר מְק֕וֹם אֲשֶׁ֥ר יוֹסֵ֖ף אָס֥וּר	1	“{that is,} in the round-house {prison/jail}, the {same} place/prison where Joseph was imprisoned/confined.” or “in the same prison where Joseph was.” See how you translated “bound” in Gen 39:20.

Some translations begin a new paragraph and sentence here that continues into verse 5 and say, “After they had been in prison {for} a while, 5 one night the king’s head wine-server and head baker dreamed …”
40:4	zjgp			יָמִ֖ים	1	“{for} some days/time,” or “{for} a while,” The phrase “{for} days” is a general expression that refers to an unspecified length of time.

40:5	g1sc			אִ֖ישׁ כְּ⁠פִתְר֣וֹן חֲלֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	“{and} each of the dreams had its own interpretation/meaning.” or “each with its own interpretation/meaning.” or “Each {one’s} dream had its own meaning.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Or you could put this sentence earlier in this verse and say, “One night, the king of Egypt’s wine server and baker each had a dream while they were in prison, and each {man’s/one’s} dream had its own interpretation/meaning.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cupbearer and baker in verse 5 are the same officials as those in verses 2-4.

Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to have the time phrase “in the morning” first this verse.

Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
40:8	sy5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	סַפְּרוּ נָ֖א לִֽ⁠י	1	“Please tell me {what you dreamed}.” or “Please tell/describe {your dreams} to me {and God will reveal to me what they mean}.” Make sure that your translation of the last two sentences in this verse does not sound like Joseph is claiming to be God. Rather, he is saying that if the two officials tell their dreams to him, God will enable him to interpret the dreams.
40:9	qax1			וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֧ר שַֽׂר הַ⁠מַּשְׁקִ֛ים אֶת־חֲלֹמ֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠יוֹסֵ֑ף	1	“Then/So the head wine-server told Joseph what was in his dream” or “So the one/officer who was in charge of/over the wine-servers related/described to Joseph what he had seen in his dream”. See how you translated “chief of the cupbearers” in verse 2.

If grapevines and grapes are not known in your area, you could be more general in verses 9-11 and say “vine” and “fruit”. See how you translated “vineyard” in Gen 9:20.

Their land, which God gave them, was the land of Canaan (Gen 13:12, 14-15; 17:8, 23:19; 37:1). Some of that information could be put in a footnote.

It could mean: (1) “three baskets {full} of white/fine bread/cakes” or “three bread baskets” or (2) “three white/wicker baskets”. These baskets were open on top and were probably woven out of flexible strips of cane or willow branches.
40:16	olwu			עַל רֹאשִֽׁ⁠י	1	“{stacked} {on top of each other} on my head.” These baskets would have been carried on the head, each one above the other.

This phrase seems to have a literal meaning here (of having the baker beheaded) in contrast to the meaning of “lift up your head” in verse 13 (where it means to summon from a lowly or shameful place). Make sure your translation of this phrase is accurate and clear in both contexts.

You could use the name of a type of bird that is well-known in your language area. See how you translated “eating” in verse 17.

See how you translated similar clauses in verses 3 (See: note), 13, and 19, where Pharaoh had his soldiers do something. Also see how you translated “lifted up your head” in verse 13, where it has a similar meaning.

Also, notice that “the chief of the bakers” is at the beginning of this clause in the Hebrew text to emphasize him and contrast him with what happened to the chief cupbearer. Do what is natural in your language. See how you translated “hang … on a tree” in verse 19.

They had power from demons to do miracles (Exodus 7:11, 22; 8:7) and to communicate with the spirits of people who had died. They may have also been astrologers or Egyptian priests who were skilled in sacred writings. Some of that information could be put in a footnote.

41:9	lq2t			אֶת חֲטָאַ֕⁠י	1	“my sins/failures.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “{the time} when I offended/displeased/wronged {you}.” or (2) “something {important} I failed/forgot to do.” The second interpretation refers to the cupbearer forgetting to tell Pharaoh about Joseph.

Also consider again how you translated “chief of the bakers” and “baker” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 40:1-2, 4-5, 16-17, 20, 22; 41:10, 13.

Also see how you translated “hanged/impaled {on a tree/pole}” in Gen 40:22.

Since Joseph lived in Egypt and Egyptian men kept their heads and faces clean-shaven, Joseph probably also shaved his head and his face. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make this implied information explicit in your translation.
41:14	x9jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א אֶל פַּרְעֹֽה	1	“came/went before Pharaoh.” or “came/went into Pharaoh’s presence.” Your choice of “came” versus “went” in this context depends on whose perspective you take: “came” reflects things from Pharaoh’s point of view, and “went” reflects things from Joseph’s point of view. Do what is most natural in your language.

41:38	n386			אֲשֶׁ֛ר ר֥וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֖ים בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “who has God’s Spirit in him” or “whom God’s Spirit guides” or (2) “who has a divine spirit in him” or “who has a spirit of {the} gods in him”. Most translations follow the first interpretation, since Joseph had just talked to Pharaoh about God (verses 16, 28, 32) and Pharaoh acknowledges God in verse 39.
41:39	brta			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר פַּרְעֹה֙ אֶל יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	“Then he said to Joseph,” or “Then Pharaoh/he {turned} to Joseph and said,”

The Hebrew word for “fine linen” refers to a special kind of white cloth that was woven out of flax and had a fine texture. Clothes made from linen were expensive and were worn by the king and high officials. If linen is not known in your language area, you could be more general and refer to expensive, high-quality clothes.

41:43	m84b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	אַבְרֵ֑ךְ	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could be: (1) a transliteration of an Egyptian word that means “Bow down {in reverence/respect}!” or “Make way {for the king’s appointed one}!” or “Welcome/Honor {your new leader}!” which is what people would be told to do to honor an important person; or (2) a combination of Hebrew words that means “{This is} {the} father of {the} king!”, which is similar to what Joseph says in Gen 45:8.
41:43	ry99			וְ⁠נָת֣וֹן אֹת֔⁠וֹ עַ֖ל	1	“So Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of” or “In that way, Pharaoh {officially} appointed/installed Joseph to be {the manager/supervisor} over/of”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 41.

42:26	g86q			וַ⁠יִּשְׂא֥וּ	1	“Then his brothers loaded/put” or “they loaded/put” or “his brothers loaded/put”. Make sure your choice here fits with the way you translated the end of verse 25.

Do what is best in your language.
42:37	cqwt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תְּנָ֤⁠ה אֹת⁠וֹ֙ עַל יָדִ֔⁠י	1	“Entrust him/Benjamin to my care {as we travel to Egypt},” or “Let me be responsible for {taking care of} him/Benjamin {on our trip to Egypt},” The phrase “in my hand” is used here as an idiom that means that Reuben was going to be responsible for Benjamin’s welfare.
42:37	wz8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י אֲשִׁיבֶ֥⁠נּוּ אֵלֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	“and {I promise that} I will bring him back to you {safely}.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this quote and say, “{Father,} let me be responsible for {taking} Benjamin {down to Egypt}. If I fail to bring him {back} to you {safely}, you can {punish me by} killing my two sons.” Do what is best in your language.
42:38	vyte		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	“But his father replied/insisted,”
42:38	lta2			לֹֽא יֵרֵ֥ד בְּנִ֖⁠י עִמָּ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	“My son {Benjamin} will/may not go with you {to Egypt},” or “{No,} I will not let my son {Benjamin} go down {to Egypt} with you.” Notice that the pronoun “you” is plural in this verse. Also, see how you translated “go down” in verse 2.
42:38	lyr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	כִּֽי אָחִ֨י⁠ו מֵ֜ת	1	“His brother is dead,” Joseph was Benjamin’s older brother from the same father and mother. Consider whether your language has a special kinship term for that. Also consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.
42:38	gth5			וְ⁠ה֧וּא לְ⁠בַדּ֣⁠וֹ נִשְׁאָ֗ר	1	“so he is the only one {of his mother’s sons} {who is} still alive.” or “and/so he is the only one/son {I have} left {from his mother}.” You could include a footnote here that explains that Joseph and Benjamin were the only two sons of Rachel, Jacob’s favorite wife who died after giving birth to Benjamin (Gen 35:16-20).
42:38	q1la		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	וּ⁠קְרָאָ֤⁠הוּ אָסוֹן֙ בַּ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֵּֽלְכוּ בָ֔⁠הּ	1	“And/So if he were to be harmed/killed during your journey,” or “So if anything bad happened to him while you are traveling,” Jacob is saying what would happen if he lost Benjamin too. Consider what is the best way to translate this hypothetical statement in your language. Also, see how you translated “harm … meet him” in verse 4.
42:38	bz42			וְ⁠הוֹרַדְתֶּ֧ם אֶת שֵׂיבָתִ֛⁠י בְּ⁠יָג֖וֹן	1	“you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, to grieve so deeply/badly that I would {die and} go down” or “you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, so much sorrow/grief that I would {die and} go down”. Jacob uses the phrase “my gray head” to refer to himself as their aged father. Consider whether your language has a similar phrase that is natural and works well here.
42:38	whbu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שְׁאֽוֹלָ⁠ה	1	“to the afterworld!” The Hebrew term “Sheol” is the name of the place where the spirits of people went after they died. If you transliterate the name “Sheol” in your translation, you could put its meaning in a footnote. See how you translated this term in Gen 37:35, and see the note about that there.
43:1	ddpw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠הָ⁠רָעָ֖ב	1	“The famine” or “The food shortage”. The setting changes here to focus on what is happening in Canaan. Some languages use a special conjunction (like “Now”) to indicate that, while others do not use a conjunction here. Do what is best in your language.
43:1	k8tt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּבֵ֥ד	1	“{was} oppressive/severe” or “{continued to be} severe”. The word “heavy” is used here as an idiom that means the famine caused everyone much suffering. See how you translated the same idiom in Gen 12:10 and Gen 41:31.
43:1	pon5			בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	“in the land/region {of Canaan}.”
43:2	ymu3			וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	“So it happened {that}” or “So”. This phrase introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Many translations omit “it happened” because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language.
43:2	wchl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר כִּלּוּ֙	1	“when Jacob and his family {had} finished eating” or “… {had} used/eaten up”. Consider whether it is clearer in your language to use a pronoun or a noun phrase here.
43:2	akxh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֶת הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔בֶר אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֵבִ֖יאוּ	1	“{all} the grain that his sons had {bought and} brought {home}”. The pronoun “they” refers here to Jacob’s sons, not Jacob’s family (as it did earlier in this sentence).
43:2	du9c			מִ⁠מִּצְרָ֑יִם	1	“from {the country of} Egypt,”
43:2	h8vf			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֲלֵי⁠הֶם֙ אֲבִי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	“their father {Jacob} told/commanded them,” or “he/Jacob told/commanded them,”

43:2	ldtz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֥⁠נוּ	1	“for us {and our families}.” or “for the/our family.” The pronoun “us” includes Jacob and his sons and their families here.
43:3	c19j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֧אמֶר אֵלָ֛י⁠ו יְהוּדָ֖ה לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	“But {his son} Judah replied to him,” or “{His son} Judah replied,”
43:3	a6uc			הָ⁠אִ֤ישׁ	1	“The man {who governs/controls the country there}” or “The governor {there}”. The brothers did not realize yet that Joseph was the governor they had spoken to in Egypt, so Judah referred to him generally here as “the man.” See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 42:30.
43:3	pib6			הָעֵ֣ד הֵעִד֩ בָּ֨⁠נוּ & לֵ⁠אמֹר֙	1	“sternly warned/told us” or “was serious when he warned us”
43:3	klhy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֹֽא תִרְא֣וּ פָנַ֔⁠י	1	“that we cannot see him {again}” or “that we cannot go/come to him {again} {to buy grain}”. Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote.
43:3	qdmg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	בִּלְתִּ֖י אֲחִי⁠כֶ֥ם אִתְּ⁠כֶֽם	1	“unless our {youngest} brother is with us!” or “if our {youngest} brother {is} not with us.” Make sure that the way you translate this clause fits with how you translated the previous part of this sentence. For some languages it is necessary to put this clause before the previous clause and say, “… that our {youngest} brother must be with us or else we will not {be permitted to} see him {again}!”
43:4	w58d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אִם יֶשְׁ⁠ךָ֛ מְשַׁלֵּ֥חַ אֶת אָחִ֖י⁠נוּ אִתָּ֑⁠נוּ	1	“{So} if you will allow/permit our {youngest} brother to go with us,” or “{So} if you will let our {youngest} brother go with us,” In verses 3-5, the pronouns “us” and “we” are exclusive since they do not include Jacob (whom Judah is talking to).

43:5	mcx4			מְשַׁלֵּ֖חַ	1	“allow/permit him to go {with us},” or “let him go {with us},” See how you translated “send” in verse 4.
43:5	yja1			לֹ֣א נֵרֵ֑ד	1	“we cannot go down {there},” or “we must not go {there} {to buy grain},” See how you translated “go down” and “went down” in Gen 42:2-3.

43:6	qmq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	“Then {their father} Israel asked {them},” If it is not clear that “Israel” (verse 6) and “their father” (verse 2) refer to the same person, you could include “their father” here in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 42:5.
43:6	xkfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ⁠מָ֥ה הֲרֵעֹתֶ֖ם לִ֑⁠י לְ⁠הַגִּ֣יד	1	“Why did you cause trouble/distress for me by telling” or “You caused me a lot of trouble/distress because you told”. Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to scold his sons and to show how upset he is. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
43:6	embi			לָ⁠אִ֔ישׁ	1	“that man” or “the/that governor”. See how you translated “the man” in verses 3 and 5.
43:6	h0lc			הַ⁠ע֥וֹד לָ⁠כֶ֖ם אָֽח	1	“that you have another brother!” or “that you have a younger brother?” If you translate this rhetorical question as a statement, make sure that you end it with a period or exclamation point.

Do what is best in your language.
43:8	daxf			שִׁלְחָ֥⁠ה הַ⁠נַּ֛עַר אִתִּ֖⁠י	1	“Allow/Permit the young man to come with me/us {and I will watch over him}” or “Entrust the young man to me {to take care of}”. See how you translated “young man” in Gen 37:2; 41:12. Use a term here in your language that fits with the fact that Benjamin was probably in his 30’s.
43:8	imi8			וְ⁠נָק֣וּמָה וְ⁠נֵלֵ֑כָה	1	“and/so we can leave right away {to buy grain in Egypt}” or “so that we can go immediately {to Egypt} {to buy grain}.”

Translate this phrase in a polite way that shows respect toward Joseph. Also, the pronoun “our” is exclusive here because Joseph’s brothers did not yet know that they were talking to Joseph.
43:28	pv3h			וַֽ⁠יִּקְּד֖וּ	1	“Then they bowed {their heads}” or “Then they knelt”. In this verse, the terms “bowed” and “bowed down” translate two different Hebrew words that together describe and emphasize the process of bowing down to the ground.

Also, consider again how you translated the idiom “lifted … eyes” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:10, 14; 18:2; 22:4, 13; 24:63-64; 31:10; 33:1, 5; 37:25; 39:7; 43:29.

This question could be an actual question or a rhetorical question. The fact that Joseph does not wait for an answer suggests that this is a rhetorical question, especially since he already realized that the new brother in the group was Benjamin (verse 16).
43:29	kj9r			אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲמַרְתֶּ֖ם אֵלָ֑⁠י	1	“whom you told me about.” Make sure that your punctuation here fits with the way you translated this sentence, either as a question or a statement.

43:29	x673			אֱלֹהִ֥ים יָחְנְ⁠ךָ֖	1	“I pray that God will be gracious/kind to you,” See how you translated “God has been gracious to …” in Gen 33:11. Also see how you translated “grace” in 24:12, 14 ,27, 49; 39:21.
43:29	etkj			בְּנִֽ⁠י	1	“young man.” The phrase “my son” is a kind way to address a man who is younger or of lower status; it does not mean that Benjamin was Joseph’s actual son. Also, for some languages it is necessary to put this address first in this quote. Do what is natural in your language.
43:30	hmes			וַ⁠יְמַהֵ֣ר יוֹסֵ֗ף	1	“Then Joseph quickly/hurriedly left {the room}” or “Then/Suddenly Joseph rushed out {of the room}”

43:30	a4rn			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥א הַ⁠חַ֖דְרָ⁠ה	1	“so he went to his private room” or “So he went to his bedroom,”

Also consider again how you translated “Hebrews” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:13, 39:14, 17; 40:15, 41:12; 43:32.

Decide whether you want to make that information explicit in your translation or include it in a footnote.

Here, it probably means that they had drunk enough wine that they were feeling happy and sociable.

The phrase, “Then it happened” introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be.

The phrase “the man’s face” refers to the governor (Joseph) himself. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.
44:26	ozil			וְ⁠אָחִ֥י⁠נוּ הַ⁠קָּטֹ֖ן אֵינֶ֥⁠נּוּ אִתָּֽ⁠נוּ	1	“if our youngest brother is not with us.” or “unless our youngest brother is with us.”

Also notice that the pronoun “us” does not include Joseph here. Some languages use an exclusive pronoun for this. Do what is best in your language.
44:27	i4rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַתֶּ֣ם יְדַעְתֶּ֔ם כִּ֥י	1	“As you {all} know,” The pronoun “you” is plural here, referring to all the brothers.

I am sure that {a wild/fierce animal} must have {killed him and} torn him apart.” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this doubly embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also see how you translated “torn. … to pieces” in Gen 37:33.
44:29	ks4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	וּ⁠לְקַחְתֶּ֧ם גַּם אֶת זֶ֛ה מֵ⁠עִ֥ם פָּנַ֖⁠י	1	“So if you also take this {son} away from me,” or “So if you also take her other son {away} from me,” Consider what is the best way to translate the hypothetical sentence in this verse. Make sure all the parts of the sentence fit together well.

See how you translated “bring my gray head down” in Gen 42:38.
44:29	ozbf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שְׁאֹֽלָ⁠ה	1	“to the afterworld.” Sheol is the Hebrew name for the world of the dead, that is, the place where the spirits of all people go after they die. You could put that information in a footnote. Your translation of “Sheol” should not refer to hell or a place of punishment. Some translations have “the grave” here, but that leaves out the idea of an afterlife that this sentence implies.
44:30	wiey			וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	“So now/then,” This phrase introduces the conclusion to what Judah said in verses 24-29. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.

Consider what is the best way to say this in your language.

Many translations omit the phrase because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language.

Also, see how you translated “bring … gray head down in sorrow to Sheol” in Gen 42:38, and a similar phrase in 44:29.
44:31	p2vj			שְׁאֹֽלָ⁠ה	1	“to the afterworld!” Consider again how you translated “Sheol” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 37:35; 42:38; 44:29, 31.

I told/assured {him} that” or “Besides that, sir, I guaranteed/promised my father that I would return his son to him safely. I told him that”. See how you translated the verb “guarantee” in Gen 43:9.

Consider again how you translated “your servant” and “your servants” throughout this chapter. See verses 7, 9, 18, 24, 27, 30-32.
44:33	wrus			עֶ֖בֶד לַֽ⁠אדֹנִ֑⁠י	1	“{as} a slave/servant for you” or “and be your slave/servant”. Throughout this chapter, the same Hebrew word is translated as “slave” when the context has negative connotations (verses 9-10, 16-17, 33), but is translated as “servant” when the context has more positive connotations (verses 7, 9, 16, 18-19, 21, 23-24, 27, 30-32). Do what is best in your language in each context.

44:34	gvqq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כִּי אֵיךְ֙ אֶֽעֱלֶ֣ה	1	“There is no way I can” or “I could never”. Judah uses this rhetorical question to emphasize how difficult it would be for him to return to his father without his brother. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
44:34	y2n4			אֶֽעֱלֶ֣ה אֶל אָבִ֔⁠י	1	“go back to my father” or “return {home} to my father”. Consider again how you translated “… up” in verses 17, 24, 33-34. Contrast that to how you translated “… down” in verses 21, 23, and 26. Some translations leave “up” or “down” implied. Do what is best in your language.

45:2	hb44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֥ן אֶת קֹל֖⁠וֹ בִּ⁠בְכִ֑י	1	“Then he raised his voice and cried loudly/uncontrollably, so that” or “But he started crying so loudly that”. Consider whether your language has an idiom such as “gave his voice in crying”. Also see how you translated “cried” in Gen 42:24; 43:30.
45:2	vv5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֖ע בֵּ֥ית פַּרְעֹֽה	1	“{many} Egyptians heard {him/it}, including {the members of} Pharaoh’s household/family.” or “the Egyptian {servants} heard {him/it}, and so did Pharaoh’s household/family.” The word “house” refers here to Pharaoh’s family members and servants, not a literal building.
45:3	qpbn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יוֹסֵ֤ף אֶל אֶחָי⁠ו֙	1	“Then Joseph/he exclaimed to his brothers {in their language},” In this chapter, the word “brothers” refers to Joseph’s older brothers (from different mothers) and his younger brother (from the same mother).
45:3	tp5e			אֲנִ֣י יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	“I {am} {your brother} Joseph!” or “I {am} Joseph, {your brother}!”
45:3	mh3c			הַ⁠ע֥וֹד אָבִ֖⁠י חָ֑י	1	“Is our father still alive?” Joseph uses “my father” to emphasize his relationship with his father. Make sure your translation does not sound like he had a different father than his brothers.

If necessary, you could make some of that information explicit in your translation.

45:9	j5m0			מַהֲרוּ֮ וַ⁠עֲל֣וּ	1	“Hurry up/back” or “Leave quickly and go back” or “Return quickly”. In this verse, the words “up” and “down” reflect the fact that Canaan was higher in elevation than Egypt. Many languages leave those words implied. Do what is best in your language.

An example of an indirect quote would be: “God has made him the ruler over all Egypt. He urges you to come down there to live near him, without delay. He also says that you and your family may live in Goshen Province and that way you will live near him … He will provide for you there …”
45:9	sku6			רְדָ֥⁠ה אֵלַ֖⁠י	1	“{So} {please} come down {here} {to live} near me,”
45:9	vcd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַֽל תַּעֲמֹֽד	1	“{and} do not delay/wait.” or “{and} do not take very long to come.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “{So} {please} do not take very long, but rather come down/here quickly {to live} near me.” Do what is best in your language.
45:10	am1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יָשַׁבְתָּ֣	1	“You {and your family} can/may live”. The pronouns “you” and “your” in this verse are singular, but Joseph’s message to his father includes the whole family.
45:10	vj43			בְ⁠אֶֽרֶץ גֹּ֗שֶׁן	1	“in the region/territory of Goshen” or “in Goshen Province/County”. Goshen was a region or territory that was part of the country of Egypt. Make sure your translation of “land” does not sound like Goshen was its own country.
45:10	db7h			וְ⁠הָיִ֤יתָ קָרוֹב֙ אֵלַ֔⁠י	1	“and that way you can be/live near me” or “That way you will/can live close to me”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

45:12	ss7a			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֤ה	1	“And/Now look/listen!” or “{Then Joseph said to his brothers,} Look!” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph’s message to his father was completed in verse 11, and that here in verse 12 he is talking directly to his brothers again.
45:12	savf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	“{I can tell that} {all of} you,” or “{All of} you,” The word “eyes” is used figuratively here (and in the next phrase) to refer to the persons themselves; it also emphasizes the fact that they were seeing Joseph in person.

These animals were donkeys (Gen 43:18, 44:3), not any other kind of animal. Also, consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote with a direct or indirect quote.
45:17	no0d			וּ⁠לְכוּ בֹ֖אוּ	1	“and go quickly {back}” or “and quickly return”. The two verbs “leave” and “go” emphasize that Joseph’s brothers should go back immediately to their father in Canaan.

Also make sure the pronouns that you use throughout verses 17 and 18 fit with whether you translate this embedded quote with a direct or indirect quote.
45:18	b98l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠אֶתְּנָ֣ה לָ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	“I will give you” or “I will give them”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Consider whether or not you have a similar idiom in your language.
45:19	rznz			וְ⁠אַתָּ֥ה צֻוֵּ֖יתָה	1	“You are also directed/instructed {to tell them}” or “{Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,} “I also command/want you {to tell them}”. The pronoun “you” is singular here and refers to Joseph. This clause is not part of Pharaoh’s message to Joseph’s brothers (verses 17-20). Make sure that is clear in your translation.

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “little ones” in Gen 43:8.

This phrase refers generally to the wealth of Egypt that will be available to Jacob’s family, including fertile land and anything else that they need.
45:20	ans7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לָ⁠כֶ֥ם	1	“{will be} yours.’ ” or “{will be} theirs.”

If that is not clear in your translation, you could put that information in a footnote. If possible in your translation, it is best to keep the name that the author chose to use in each case so that you do not change what is being emphasized.
45:21	dnbb			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֨ן לָ⁠הֶ֥ם יוֹסֵ֛ף עֲגָל֖וֹת	1	“Then Joseph gave them carts/wagons {to use}”

Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated “{shekels} of silver” in Gen 20:16 (and see the note there). Three hundred shekels of silver was equal to about 3.5 kilos (7.5 pounds).

Some languages have a similar idiom. Do what is best in your language.

Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound angry or critical. Also see how you translated “vision” in Gen 15:1.
46:2	zw7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	2	“Israel/Jacob replied {to him},” For some languages, it is more natural to put this quotation margin (“he said”) after the quote. Do what is best in your language.

In chapters 45 and 46, the text repeatedly switches back and forth between both of Jacob’s names. Make sure it is clear in your translation that these two names refer to the same person. You could include a footnote that helps readers understand what is happening.

See Gen 12:5 (and note); 13:6; 14:11-12, 16, 21; 15:14; 31:18; 36:7; 46:6. It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly different ways, depending on the context.
46:6	rgy2			אֲשֶׁ֤ר רָֽכְשׁוּ֙	1	“that they had accumulated/gotten”. Consider again how you translated “acquired” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:5; 31:18; 36:6; 46:6.

Also, throughout this section (verses 9-27), some translations use a colon before each list of names instead of “{were}” or “{who were}”. Do what is best in your language.
46:9	vobo			חֲנ֥וֹךְ וּ⁠פַלּ֖וּא וְ⁠חֶצְר֥וֹן וְ⁠כַרְמִֽי	1	“Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.” For some languages it is more natural to include “and” between every name in a list like this. For other languages it is more natural to use commas between names and leave “and” implied, except before the last name in the list. See how you translated similar lists of names in Genesis 10.

For some languages it is better to make that explicit here, rather than wait until the end of the verse. Do what is best in your language. Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Goshen” in Gen 45:10.

Translate this in a polite way that shows respect toward Pharaoh. Also, see how you translated “livestock men” in verse 32.
46:34	r4o3			גַּם אֲנַ֖חְנוּ גַּם אֲבֹתֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	“{which is} the same occupation that our forefathers/ancestors had.” See how you translated “fathers” in Gen 15:15.

However, the words emphasize what Joseph’s five brothers say next and may indicate that there was a pause between what they said in verse 3 and verse 4. Do what is best in your language.

47:7	e47i			וַ⁠יְבָ֥רֶךְ יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶת פַּרְעֹֽה	1	“and Jacob {greeted and} blessed Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob {asked God to} bless/prosper Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob greeted Pharaoh with a blessing.” In Hebrew, there is a common greeting which means “peace be to you,” so it is possible that Jacob used this blessing of peace here to greet Pharaoh.
47:8	f29q			וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֖ה אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	“Then Pharaoh asked Jacob,”

See Gen 12:10; 15:13; 17:8; 19:9; 20:1; 21:23, 34; 23:4; 26:3; 28:4; 32:4; 35:27; 37:1; 47:4, 9. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.

It was customary in Hebrew to use the blessing “peace be to you” both when greeting and when leaving someone. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 7.
47:10	kjg1			וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֖א מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה	1	“and left his presence.” or “and left him.” or “and left Pharaoh’s {throne} room.”

He gave them the choicest property {in Egypt}, which was in {Goshen Province, also known as} Rameses Province.” It is implied that Rameses (verse 11) was another name for Goshen (verses 1, 4, 6). If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Later in Egypt’s history, some of the Pharaohs were named Rameses and a city was named after one of them (Exodus 1:11).

He gave them property in Rameses Province/County, {that is, Goshen Province/County,} {which was} the choicest land {in Egypt}.” Do what is best in your language.

This clause is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that there was so little food that the people were starving. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Also consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new section that returns to the famine and how it was progressing.
47:13	wyew			בְּ⁠כָל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean: (1) “in all the earth,” or “in the entire {known} world,” or “anywhere,” which might be an exaggeration (like the previous phrase); or (2) “in all the land,” or “in the/that entire area/region {of the earth/world},” which includes Egypt and Canaan (mentioned later in the verse) and other nearby regions and countries. See how you translated “all the earth” in Gen 41:57.

Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the people who live in Egypt and Canaan, not just the lands.
47:13	jo5e			וַ⁠תֵּ֜לַהּ	1	“were fainting/weak” or “were suffering badly/terribly” or “were wasting away”. The verb “languishing” refers in general to the suffering that the famine was causing, including things such as weakness, fainting and other distress. Some languages have an idiom (like “were wasting away”) that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.

The word “all” is an exaggeration (hyperbole) which emphasizes that a large number of Egyptians went to Joseph. Consider whether or not it is best to use hyperbole here in your language.

Also notice that this address is used three times in this verse to show extra respect to Joseph. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.
47:18	ejez			תַּ֣ם הַ⁠כֶּ֔סֶף וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֥ה הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֖ה	1	“{our} silver/money is gone and our livestock/animals” or “not only is {our} silver/money {all} gone, but {all} {our} livestock/animals {also}”.

It may be necessary to translate this word in different ways, depending on the context.
47:18	qh1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶל אֲדֹנִ֑⁠י	1	“{belong} to {you,} our lord/master.” or “are yours, sir.” or “{belong} to you.” In this verse, the people use the third person (“my/our lord”) to address Joseph in a respectful manner. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.

It is different from the word for “land” in the rest of this chapter (in verses 1, 4, 6, 11, 13-15, 27-28).

The end of verse 19 specifies how the land would “die.” See how you translated a similar rhetorical question in verse 15.

See Gen 3:19 (and note); 14:18; 21:14; 28:20; 37:25; 38:6; 41:54-55; 43:31; 47:12, 15, 17, 19. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

The Samaritan Pentateuch (a different Hebrew version) and the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew text) have “made the people slaves” instead, which may refer to the fact that all the people would now be working for Pharaoh, since all the fields belonged to him. The textual variant that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.

Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah were also buried there (Gen 23:19-20; 25:9-10; 49:31). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

You could include some of that information in a footnote. The difference between versions may be due to the fact that the Hebrew words for “bed” and “staff” are very similar in spelling. Or it could be that Jacob did both; for example, he may have been sitting at the head of his bed and leaning on his staff when he bowed his head and worshiped God.

Also, make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that “Israel” (verses 2, 8, 11, 13-14, 21) and “Jacob” (verses 2-3) refer to the same person, not two different people.

Also, for some languages it may be necessary (for politeness) to make it explicit that they greeted each other first before continuing their conversation. Do what is best in your language.

It may also be more natural to put the time and place phrases first in this verse and say, “{Long ago} {when I was} at {the town of} Luz in the land/region of Canaan, God Almighty …” Do what is best in your language.

48:4	m1hy			הִנְ⁠נִ֤י מַפְרְ⁠ךָ֙ וְ⁠הִרְבִּיתִ֔⁠ךָ וּ⁠נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	“Look/Listen, I will give you many descendants who will increase {in number} and become” or “Look/Listen, I will give you {and your descendants} many children so that your descendants will become”. See how you translated “make you fruitful and multiply you” in Gen 28:3 and “make him fruitful and … multiply him” in Gen 17:20.
48:4	n300			לִ⁠קְהַ֣ל עַמִּ֑ים	1	“many people/ethnic groups.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 28:3, and a similar phrase (“a community of nations”) in 35:11.

48:5	khph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּ⁠רְאוּבֵ֥ן וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וֹן יִֽהְיוּ לִֽ⁠י	1	“just as/like Reuben and Simeon are my sons.” or “just as/like my sons Reuben and Simeon.” For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the names of these sons earlier in the verse and say, “Now then, your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you here in the country of Egypt before I joined you here, {I will treat as} my sons, just as/like …” Do what is best in your language.
48:6	vme7			וּ⁠מוֹלַדְתְּ⁠ךָ֛ אֲשֶׁר הוֹלַ֥דְתָּ אַחֲרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם לְ⁠ךָ֣ יִהְי֑וּ	1	“But any {other} children that you father/have later on will be yours.” or “If you father/have any more/other children, they will belong to you.”
48:6	rqc8			עַ֣ל שֵׁ֧ם אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֛ם יִקָּרְא֖וּ בְּ⁠נַחֲלָתָֽ⁠ם	1	“So they will share in some of what their brothers inherit {from me}.” or “{so that} what they inherit {from me} will be some of what their brothers {Ephraim and Manasseh} inherit {from me}.” Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the previous sentence.
48:7	jw7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	“I {want it this way because}” or “I {am doing this because}”. Jacob is probably explaining in verse 7 that since his favorite wife Rachel died with only two sons, that is why he is treating her son Joseph’s two sons as his sons (verses 5-6). You could make some of that information explicit in your translation or include it in a footnote.
48:7	awjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠בֹאִ֣⁠י	1	“as I {and our family} were coming/returning {home}” or “as our family was coming/returning {home}”. Jacob is in focus here, but he was traveling with his family, not alone. Decide whether or not it is necessary to make that explicit in your translation.
48:7	gfi4			מִ⁠פַּדָּ֗ן	1	“from {the land/region of} Paddan {Aram},” Consider again how you translated “{the land/region of} Paddan Aram” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 25:20 (and note); 28:2, 5-7; 31:18; 33:18; 35:9, 26; 46:15; 48:7. Also, be consistent with how you spelled “Aram” in those verses and in Gen 10:22-23; 22:21; 24:10.
48:7	hucm			רָחֵ֜ל	1	“{your mother} Rachel” or “{my beloved wife} Rachel”
48:7	ykrl			מֵ֩תָה֩ עָלַ֨⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here because the preposition can have different meanings. It could mean: (1) “died beside me” or “died by my side”; or (2) “died, {bringing sorrow/grief} on/to me”
48:7	xolh			בְּ⁠אֶ֤רֶץ כְּנַ֨עַן֙	1	“in the region of Canaan”
48:7	oocn			בַּ⁠דֶּ֔רֶךְ בְּ⁠ע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת אֶ֖רֶץ לָ⁠בֹ֣א אֶפְרָ֑תָה	1	“while we were still traveling and some distance away from {the town of} Ephrath.” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Ephrath” in Gen 35:16, 19, and how you spelled “Bethlehem” in 35:19.
48:7	tp7m			וָ⁠אֶקְבְּרֶ֤⁠הָ שָּׁם֙ בְּ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔ת	1	“{As you know,} I buried her body there by the road that goes to Ephrath,”
48:7	p9yz			הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	“which {now has the name} Bethlehem.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. This phrase might be: (1) Jacob’s words; or (2) the author’s words. If you follow the second interpretation, you could put this phrase within parentheses, outside of the quote marks.
48:8	bal2			וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל אֶת בְּנֵ֣י יוֹסֵ֑ף	1	“Then Israel saw/noticed Joseph’s {two} sons”
48:8	yv08			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	“and asked {him/Joseph},”
48:8	wri5			מִי אֵֽלֶּה	1	“Who {are} these {young men}?” or “Whose {sons} {are} these?” Joseph’s two sons were in their 20s at this time, so refer to them here with a term that fits with that fact. They were born before the famine started (Gen 41:50-52), and Jacob had now been in Egypt for 17 years (47:28).
48:9	pmfc			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל אָבִ֔י⁠ו	1	“Joseph said/replied to him,” or “Joseph replied/answered,”

48:10	w5i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ כָּבְד֣וּ	1	“Now Israel’s eyes were weak/failing” or “Israel was almost blind” or “Israel had very poor/bad eyesight”. Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a conjunction (“Now”) to begin this clause that gives background information about Israel. Also, the word “heavy” is used here as an idiom that means Israel’s eyesight was getting bad, but he could still see some (as indicated in verses 8 and 11). Many languages have a similar idiom. A translation of verse 10 should not imply that Israel was completely blind.
48:10	nhh8			מִ⁠זֹּ֔קֶן	1	“because of old age,” or “because he was {very} old,”
48:10	igr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠רְא֑וֹת	1	“{so that} he could not see {very clearly/well}.” For some languages it is more natural to switch the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “Now Israel was {very} old, so his eyesight was failing and he was not able to see {very well}.” Do what is best in your language.
48:10	m3l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֤שׁ אֹתָ⁠ם֙ אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	“So Joseph brought/took his sons near/closer to his father,” or “So he/Joseph had his sons stand near/close to his father,” Make sure it is clear in your translation whom is being referred to at each point in this sentence.

48:10	yxhu			וַ⁠יְחַבֵּ֥ק לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	“and hugged them.” Consider again how you translated the word “embraced” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 29:13; 33:4; 48:10. Also compare that to how you translated an idiom (“fell on … neck”) that has a similar meaning in Gen 33:4; 45:14, 46:29. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.

48:12	agib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מֵ⁠עִ֣ם בִּרְכָּ֑י⁠ו	1	“from beside his father’s knees,” or “from beside/near his father,” Joseph’s sons (who were in their 20s) were near Israel's knees, so that he could hug them; they were not sitting on his knees or lap. Also make sure your translation of “his” refers to Joseph's father (Israel/Jacob), not Joseph.
48:12	kz74			וַ⁠יִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ	1	“and he bowed {before his father}” or “and he prostrated himself {before him}”

If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote.

48:13	o7vq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֖שׁ אֵלָֽי⁠ו	1	“and he brought/took {them} close to his father {again}.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Then he took/brought his sons close to his father {again}. He had Ephraim stand in front of Israel’s left {hand/side}, and he had Manasseh stand in front of Israel’s right {hand/side}.” Do what is best in your language.

He crossed his arms {to do that}” or “Then he crossed his arms and {put} his left hand on Manasseh’s head,” In the Hebrew culture, the right side was the place of highest honor and using the right hand to bless someone was symbolic of giving greater honor to that person. The oldest son was also the one who normally received the greater blessing. Israel reverses that here and gives Joseph’s younger son the greater blessing. It may be important to include a footnote in your translation that gives this information.
48:14	jxo4			כִּ֥י	1	“{even} though” or “in spite of the fact that”. Make sure that the way you translate “because” fits with the fact that Israel wanted to place his right hand on Ephraim (to give him the greater blessing), even though Manasseh was the firstborn (who would normally receive the greater blessing in that culture).
48:14	u8qz			מְנַשֶּׁ֖ה הַ⁠בְּכֽוֹר	1	“Manasseh {was} the/{Joseph’s} firstborn/oldest {son}.”

48:15	gsdn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֡ים	1	“May {God bless your sons,} the God” or “I pray that {God will bless your sons,} the God” or “I ask God {to bless your sons}. He is the God”. For some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit here that this prayer is a blessing for Joseph’s sons (rather than waiting until that is made clear in verse 16). Do what is best in your language. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up the long sentence in verses 15-16 into shorter sentences.

You may need to translate it differently in different contexts.
48:15	bi81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙ הָ⁠רֹעֶ֣ה אֹתִ֔⁠י	1	“the {same} God who has watched over me” or “He is the {same} God who has taken care of me”. The word “shepherded” includes guiding, protecting, and providing food and water, such as a shepherd would do for his sheep. Here it is used as a metaphor that refers to God’s complete care of Israel throughout his life. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to use a similar metaphor here. For example, you could say, “He is the {same} God who, for my entire life, has taken care of all my needs, just as a {good} shepherd takes care of his sheep.”
48:15	dt5m			מֵ⁠עוֹדִ֖⁠י עַד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	“from {the beginning of} my {life} until the present day/time,” or “my entire life,”

Also consider again how you translated “angel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 16:7, 9-11; 19:1, 15; 21:17; 22:11, 15; 24:7, 40; 28:12; 31:11; 32:3, 6; 48:16.
48:16	hkqg			יְבָרֵךְ֮ אֶת הַ⁠נְּעָרִים֒	1	“I pray/ask that he will cause {these} young men to prosper {greatly},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here; your decision will depend on how you translated verse 15. Also, since Joseph’s sons were probably in their 20s, make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like they were little boys. The Hebrew word for “boy” here can also be translated as “lad,” “servant,” or “young man,” depending on the context and who is speaking to whom. With that in mind, consider again how you translated this word in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:24; 18:7; 19:4; 21:12, 17-20; 22:3, 5, 12, 19; 25:27; 34:19; 37:2; 41:12; 43:8; 44:22, 30-34; 48:16.

48:22	xrzo			וַ⁠אֲנִ֞י נָתַ֧תִּֽי לְ⁠ךָ֛	1	“And I give/bequeath to you {as part of your inheritance}” or “Besides that, {as part of your inheritance from me,} I {hereby} give you”. The pronouns “you” and “your” shift to singular in verse 22.
48:22	cazk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שְׁכֶ֥ם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could refer to: (1) “{the city of} Shechem,” or (2) “a mountain slope/ridge,” This second interpretation comes from the meaning of the Hebrew word “shekem” (“shoulder”), which can be used as a metaphor to refer to a mountain slope or ridge.

This is more {land} than I am giving to your brothers.” Do what is best in your language. Also consider again how you translated “Amorite{s}” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:16; 14:7, 13; 15:16, 21; 48:22.
49:1	i8ic			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶל בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	“Then Jacob summoned {all} his sons”. The events in chapter 49 may have occurred on the same day as the events in chapter 48, or not very long after that. Consider again how you translated “called for” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:18; 14:14; 20:2, 8-9; 24:57-58; 26:9; 27:1, 42; 28:1; 31:4; 39:14; 41:8, 14; 46:33; 47:29; 49:1.
49:1	g7x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	“He said {to them},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
49:1	l6m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	הֵאָֽסְפוּ֙	1	“Gather {yourselves} together {before me},” or “Come together {here},” Much of what Jacob says to his sons in verses 1-27 is Hebrew poetry, which is characterized by the use of parallelisms and metaphors to emphasize important points. Many translations put these verses in poetry format (starting here); many others use regular paragraph formatting. Do what is best in your language. For a complete list of verses that some translations treat as poetry in the book of Genesis, see the introduction to the book.
49:1	upew			וְ⁠אַגִּ֣ידָה לָ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	“and I will declare to you” or “so that I can tell/inform you”
49:1	gmu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר יִקְרָ֥א אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	“what will happen to you {and your descendants}”. Much of what Jacob prophesies in this chapter about his sons also applies to their descendants. Some translation teams may prefer to put that information in a footnote rather than make it explicit in the text. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “meet” in Gen 42:4, 38.
49:1	xg3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠אַחֲרִ֥ית הַ⁠יָּמִֽים	1	“in the days/years ahead.” or “in future days/years.” In this context, this phrase refers to a period of years in the future. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
49:2	j5co		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הִקָּבְצ֥וּ וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	“{Yes/Indeed,} Jacob’s/my sons, come/gather {here} and hear {what I have to say},” or “My sons, gather around {me,} {your father} Jacob, and listen {to me}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that Jacob is talking to his own sons and is referring to himself as both Jacob and as Israel. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put the address “sons of Jacob” first in verse 2, or even first in the quote (which begins in verse 1). Do what is best in your language.
49:2	xh8b			וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וּ אֶל יִשְׂרָאֵ֥ל אֲבִי⁠כֶֽם	1	“Pay attention to {me,} your father Israel.” or “{I,} your father Israel, have something {important} to tell you.” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause to emphasize that Jacob wants his sons to listen to him carefully. Try to keep both halves of this parallelism in your translation, since each half has a slightly different focus. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
49:3	tmwk			רְאוּבֵן֙ בְּכֹ֣רִ⁠י אַ֔תָּה	1	“Reuben, you {are} my oldest {son},” Consider again how you translated “firstborn” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:4; 10:15; 19:31, 33-34, 37; 22:21; 25:13, 27; 27:19, 32; 29:26; 35:23; 36:15; 38:6-7; 41:51; 43:33; 46:8, 14; 48:18; 49:3. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
49:3	wp60		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	כֹּחִ֖⁠י וְ⁠רֵאשִׁ֣ית אוֹנִ֑⁠י	1	“{the result of} my strength/fertility, and the first child I had as a young man.” or “{You are} the first {evidence/sign} of my manhood and strength/virility.” This phrase is used here as a euphemistic idiom that refers to Jacob’s ability to have children. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Translate this in a way that will not embarrass or offend listeners.
49:3	zu3n			יֶ֥תֶר שְׂאֵ֖ת וְ⁠יֶ֥תֶר עָֽז	1	“{You had} higher/more honor and authority {than all your brothers}.” or “{You had} high status and great authority {in our family}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
49:4	ngg3			פַּ֤חַז	1	“{However,} {you are} uncontrollable” or “{However,} {you are} unstable/reckless”
49:4	m3c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙	1	“like a flood of water,” or “like {rushing} water,” Here Jacob compares Reuben’s reckless, uncontrolled sexual behavior to turbulent water that is out of control and destructive. Consider whether or not you have a similar simile in your language that would fit well here.
49:4	ht6q			אַל תּוֹתַ֔ר	1	“{so} you will no longer have your high/important status/position {in our family},” or “{so} you will no longer be first {among your brothers},”

49:4	u62z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יְצוּעִ֥⁠י עָלָֽה	1	“{Then Jacob exclaimed,} “He went up {onto} my couch!” ” or “He/You {actually} climbed/got up {onto} my couch/bed {and dishonored me}!” or “{You dishonored me when} you slept with my concubine/wife!” Here Jacob repeats part of what he said in the previous clause, in order to emphasize Reuben’s sin against him and to communicate how upset he is about it. He may have still been talking to Reuben (switching from second to third person), or he may have been exclaiming about Reuben to himself and the rest of his sons.
49:5	jadm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	שִׁמְע֥וֹן וְ⁠לֵוִ֖י	1	“{As for} Simeon and Levi, {they}” or “Simeon and Levi, {you}”. In verses 3-27, Jacob sometimes refers to his sons using second person (“you”), and sometimes (as here) he uses third person (“they” or “he”). Consider whether or not it is better in your language to use second person throughout these verses, especially since Jacob is talking to his sons who are right there with him. Also, some languages have dual pronouns that fit well in verses 5-7.
49:5	lnz6			אַחִ֑ים	1	“{are} {true/close} brothers.” or “{are} partners {in crime}.” or “do {evil} things together.” This phrase is used here as an idiom that emphasizes the fact that Simeon and Levi thought alike and acted together to do evil things.
49:5	hpdj			כְּלֵ֥י חָמָ֖ס מְכֵרֹתֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	“They/You use their/your swords/weapons to do violent things {together}.” Make sure in your translation that the pronouns you use here (and in verses 6-7) fit with the way you translated the beginning of this verse.
49:6	sbst		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אַל תָּבֹ֣א נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	“Do not ever let me” or “May I never” or “I will never”. Here Jacob uses the phrase “my soul” to refer to himself and to emphasize how strongly he feels about what he is saying. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.
49:6	h9hm			בְּ⁠סֹדָ⁠ם֙ אַל־תָּבֹ֣א	1	“take part in their/your {evil} plans/schemes!” or “participate with them/you when they/you plan {evil} things!” In verses 5-7, Jacob is probably referring to the time when Simeon and Levi killed all the males in the city of Shechem out of revenge (Genesis 34:25-26, 30). Jacob was very upset that they did that.
49:6	z996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בִּ⁠קְהָלָ֖⁠ם אַל תֵּחַ֣ד כְּבֹדִ֑⁠י	1	“Do not let my honor/presence be connected/associated with their/your {evil} plans,” or “I never want to be linked/associated with their/your {evil} plans,” or “I refuse to make {evil} plans with them/you,” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause and emphasizes that Jacob is upset and does not want to participate with these two sons in their evil behavior. Consider what is the best way to translate that in your language.
49:6	ckzx			כִּ֤י בְ⁠אַפָּ⁠ם֙ הָ֣רְגוּ אִ֔ישׁ	1	“because they/you became angry and murdered {many} men/people,” The phrase “a man” probably refers collectively here to all the men whom these two sons killed in the city of Shechem (Gen 34:25-26, 30).
49:6	z1y0			וּ⁠בִ⁠רְצֹנָ֖⁠ם עִקְּרוּ שֽׁוֹר	1	“and {just} to please/entertain themselves/yourselves, they/you crippled/maimed {some} oxen/cattle {so they could not walk}.” or “and they/you cut the leg tendons of {some} oxen/cattle, {just} for the fun of it.” This may have happened during the time that Simeon and Levi took revenge on the people of Shechem.
49:7	cb28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אָר֤וּר אַפָּ⁠ם֙ כִּ֣י עָ֔ז וְ⁠עֶבְרָתָ֖⁠ם כִּ֣י קָשָׁ֑תָה	1	“{May God} curse {them/you for} their/your intense/terrible anger and {their/your} cruel/malicious fury!” or “{I ask God to} curse/punish them/you for being so intensely/fiercely angry and cruel/malicious!” Consider what is the best way to translate this parallelism in your language. Also, consider again how you translated “cursed” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 3:14 (and note), 17; 4:11; 5:29; 8:21; 9:25; 12:3; 27:12-13, 29; 49:7.
49:7	ykq9			אֲחַלְּקֵ֣⁠ם	1	“I {ask God to} scatter/disperse them/you {and their/your descendants}” or “May {God/he} cause them/you {and their/your descendants} to be spread out”. The last half of verse 7 specifies how Jacob is asking God to curse Simeon and Levi.
49:7	f5mw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	“among {the family/descendants of} Jacob.” In this context, the name “Jacob” refers to his family and especially his descendants.
49:7	b95x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַ⁠אֲפִיצֵ֖⁠ם	1	“Yes, I/God will” or “That’s right, I {ask God/him to}”. The clauses “I will divide …” and “I will scatter …” form a parallelism that emphasizes the way Jacob is asking God to curse Simeon and Levi. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of a parallelism in your translation.
49:7	e9qw			וַ⁠אֲפִיצֵ֖⁠ם	1	“scatter/disperse them/you” or “cause them/you to be spread out”. Consider again how you translated “scatter” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:18, 32; 11:4, 8-9; 49:7. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. If the pronoun “you” is used here in your translation, it should be plural.
49:7	ih68			בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	“throughout {the descendants/land of} Israel.” Jacob’s prophecy in verse 7 came true many years later: the tribe of Simeon was absorbed by the tribe of Judah (Joshua 19:1), and the tribe of Levi never had its own territory, but rather lived in cities scattered throughout the other tribes of Israel (Joshua 21:1-42). You could put this information in a footnote.
49:8	mfza			יְהוּדָ֗ה אַתָּה֙ יוֹד֣וּ⁠ךָ אַחֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	“Judah, you {are the one whom} your brothers will praise.” or “Judah, you {and your descendants} will be {highly} praised by your brothers {and their descendants}.” or “Judah, your brothers {and their descendants} will {highly} praise you {and your descendants}.” In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “you” is emphatic, and it has an emphatic position in the sentence. Consider what is the best way to communicate that emphasis in your language.
49:8	lhkv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ בְּ⁠עֹ֣רֶף	1	“You will be victorious over” or “You will conquer/defeat”. Consider what is the best way to translate this Hebrew idiom in your language. Also, if your translation includes Judah’s descendants in the previous sentence, make sure that the pronouns “your” and “you” are plural in this sentence.
49:8	sr42			אֹיְבֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	“those who are against you.” or “your enemies/adversaries.”
49:8	m4n8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בְּנֵ֥י אָבִֽי⁠ךָ	1	“Your father’s {other} sons” or “{Then} my {other} sons” or “Your brothers”. Make sure that your translation of “your father” refers to Jacob.
49:8	o2b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	יִשְׁתַּחֲוּ֥וּ לְ⁠ךָ֖	1	“{and their descendants} will bow/prostrate themselves before you {and your descendants} {in respect/submission}.” Consider again how you translated “bow down” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 18:2; 19:1; 22:5; 23:7, 12; 24:26, 48, 52; 27:29; 33:3, 6-7; 37:7, 9-10; 42:6; 43:26, 28; 47:31; 48:12; 49:8. Also see how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 17:3, 17.
49:9	kcdh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	גּ֤וּר אַרְיֵה֙ יְהוּדָ֔ה מִ⁠טֶּ֖רֶף בְּנִ֣⁠י עָלִ֑יתָ	1	“Judah, my son, {you are} {powerful} {like} a young lion that has returned {to its den} after {killing} {its} prey.” or “Judah, {you,} my son, {are} {like} a {powerful} young lion that {kills its} prey and returns {to its den}.”
49:9	zrcx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כָּרַ֨ע רָבַ֧ץ כְּ⁠אַרְיֵ֛ה	1	“You {are} like a lion that stretches out {and} lies down {to sleep/rest} {after eating}.” or “It stretches out {and} lies down {to sleep}.” Here in verse 9 Jacob switches to using third person references (“he, his, him”) for Judah. For some languages it is better to use second person references (“you, your”) throughout verses 8-12. Do what is best in your language.
49:9	tf30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠כְ⁠לָבִ֖יא מִ֥י יְקִימֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	“Yes, {you are} like a lioness/lion that no one dares to awaken/disturb.” or “No one dares to disturb/disrespect that lion.” This sentence forms a parallelism with the previous sentence to emphasize Judah’s authority. Also, Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize the respect that people will have for Judah. Some languages must use a statement here instead. Do what is best in your language.
49:10	lg21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא יָס֥וּר שֵׁ֨בֶט֙ מִֽ⁠יהוּדָ֔ה	1	“Judah, the authority to rule will always belong to you {and your descendants}.” or “Judah, there will always be one of your descendants ruling as king.” A scepter, or a king’s staff, is a special, decorated rod that a king holds to symbolize his authority to rule the people who are under him.
49:10	yr2o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וּ⁠מְחֹקֵ֖ק מִ⁠בֵּ֣ין רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	“The {king’s/ruler’s} staff will never leave his/your descendants/family” or “In fact, your descendants will rule”. This phrase forms a parallelism with the previous clause and emphasizes the authority that Judah and his descendants will have.
49:10	f9a1			עַ֚ד כִּֽי יָבֹ֣א שִׁיל֔וֹ	1	“until the {highest} king comes/arrives” or “until the One whom the scepter/kingdom belongs to comes/arrives”. Jacob is probably prophesying here about the coming of the Messiah/Christ. This fits with the fact that Jesus was a descendant of the tribe of Judah and is now ruling as the true King over heaven and earth. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
49:10	jg91			וְ⁠ל֖⁠וֹ יִקְּהַ֥ת עַמִּֽים	1	“and the peoples/nations {of the earth} obey him.” or “and all people obey him.” or “All people/nations will obey him.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
49:11	tpc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹסְרִ֤י	1	“Judah {and his descendants}” or “You {and your descendants}”. In verse 11, the pronouns “he” and “his” refer to Judah and his descendants. To make that clear, you could make that explicit here and then use plural pronouns “they” and “their” throughout the verse. Or if you are using the second person throughout this section, you could say, “You {and your descendants} …” and use plural pronouns “you” and “your” after that.
49:11	nav1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֹסְרִ֤י לַ⁠גֶּ֨פֶן֙ עִיר֔וֹ	1	“will {be so wealthy that they/you will/could} tether/tie their/your donkey{s} to {their/your} {grape}vine{s} {to eat the valuable fruit}.” or “let your donkey{s} eat your choice/valuable {grape}vine{s}.” In Jacob’s culture grapevines were valuable plants, so unless a person was very rich, he would never tether a donkey to his grapevines because it would eat the fruit and the vines. If necessary, you could make some of that information explicit in your translation.
49:11	gjb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠לַ⁠שֹּׂרֵקָ֖ה בְּנִ֣י אֲתֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	“Their/Your donkeys’ colts will/could eat the best/finest grapevines.” or “{It will not matter if} their/your donkeys’ colts eat {their/your} best/finest {grapevine} branch{es}.” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous one to emphasize how wealthy Judah and his descendants will be.

The phrase “blood of grapes” is an idiom that refers to red wine made from the juice of grapes.
49:12	s3uy			עֵינַ֖יִם	1	“{Their/Your} eyes” or “{They/You will be so blessed/wealthy that} {their/your} eyes”
49:12	cm3s			חַכְלִילִ֥י & מִ⁠יָּ֑יִן	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “{will be} bright from {drinking} {abundant} wine,” or (2) “{will be} darker than wine,” In both interpretations the emphasis is that Judah’s descendants will be blessed with an abundance of the best foods, including wine and milk, which are examples of the most valuable foods that were produced in the land.
49:12	rmn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠לְבֶן־שִׁנַּ֖יִם מֵ⁠חָלָֽב	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “and {their/your} teeth {will be} white from {drinking} {abundant} milk.” or (2) “and {their/your} teeth {will be} whiter than milk.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase fits with the interpretation you used for the first part of this verse. For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of some of these phrases and say, “{They/You will be so blessed/wealthy that} they/you will have plenty of the best foods, including {abundant} wine and milk.” Do what is best in your language.
49:13	xffh			זְבוּלֻ֕ן	1	“{As for} Zebulun, {he} {and his descendants}” or “Zebulun, {you} {and your descendants}”. Throughout this chapter, decide whether it is best in your language to use third person or second person when Jacob refers to each of his sons (and their descendants).
49:13	wtx1			לְ⁠ח֥וֹף יַמִּ֖ים יִשְׁכֹּ֑ן	1	“will settle/live at/near the seashore/coast,”

49:13	r8u3			וְ⁠יַרְכָת֖⁠וֹ	1	“Their/Your territory {will extend}”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
49:13	cqfv			עַל צִידֹֽן	1	“{all the way north/up} to {the city of} Sidon.” or “as far {north} as {the city of} Sidon.”

49:14	x4v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	חֲמֹ֣ר גָּ֑רֶם	1	“{will be} {like} a strong/sturdy donkey”. Consider again how you translated “donkey” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:16; 16:12; 22:3, 5, 6; 24:35; 30:43; 32:5, 15; 34:28; 36:24; 42:26-27; 43:18, 24; 44:3, 13; 45:23; 47:17; 49:14.

49:14	e90c			בֵּ֥ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתָֽיִם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “between two saddlebags/loads.” or (2) “between the two parts of a sheep pen.” Both interpretations imply that the donkey is lying down to rest after it worked hard.

The same phrase is repeated here to emphasize how prosperous and productive Joseph (and his descendants) will be. Instead of saying the same phrase twice, many translations combine the two phrases and form one clause that communicates the emphasis in a different way. Do what is accurate and natural in your language.

In the same way God takes care of his people and provides for all of their needs. See Psalm 23 which also talks about God as our Shepherd. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

49:26	n6h1			עַֽד תַּאֲוַ֖ת	1	The meaning of the Hebrew text is uncertain here. It could mean: (1) “{He has blessed me with bounties/riches that are} greater than the bounties/riches {that come} from” or (2) “{My blessings are} {so great that they extend} to the utmost/farthest boundaries/limits of”.

To do that, it is helpful to read your translation of this section aloud.

See Gen 12:15 (and note), 16-18, 20; 37:36; 39:1; 40:2, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19; 41:1, 4, 7-10, 14-17, 25, 28, 32-35, 37-39, 41-46, 55; 42:15-16; 44:18; 45:2, 8, 16-17, 21; 46:5, 31, 33-34; 47:1-5, 7-11, 14, 19-26; 50:4, 6-7. Also consider again how you translated “servants” and “officials” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 20:8; 40:2, 4, 7, 20; 41:10, 37-38; 45:16; 50:7.
50:7	d3od			זִקְנֵ֣י בֵית֔⁠וֹ	1	“{including} the senior/important men/leaders in/from his/Pharaoh’s household/court”. The “elders” were probably older men who had served Pharaoh for a long time and held important positions in his court.

Also see how you translated “herd” in Gen 18:7-8, and how you translated “flock” in Gen 4:2, 4; 21:28; 27:9; 29:2-3, 6-10; 30:31, 32, 36, 38-43; 31:4, 8, 10, 12, 19, 38, 41, 43; 32:6; 37:2, 12, 14; 38:12, 13, 17; 46:34; 47:1, 17. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.
50:8	redu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עָזְב֖וּ	1	“they left {behind}” or “were left {behind} {with servants/caretakers}”. The children and animals were probably left with servants who took care of them during the funeral.

50:8	o9qv			בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ גֹּֽשֶׁן	1	“in the region of Goshen.” or “in Goshen Province.” Consider again how you translated “the land/region of Goshen” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 45:10; 46:28-29, 34; 47:1, 4, 6, 27; 50:8.

50:10	nwg3			גֹּ֣רֶן הָאָטָ֗ד	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “Atad’s threshing floor/place,” or “a place owned by {a man named} Atad where people separated grain {from chaff},” or (2) “the threshing floor/place near {the city/town of} Atad,” or “Goren Ha-Atad,” or (3) “the {grain/wheat} threshing place that was surrounded by thornbushes,” The Hebrew word “atad” means “thorns,” but most Bible scholars think it refers here to the name of a person or city.

It was most likely on the west side of the Jordan River, since that is where the cave was located and that is where the Canaanites would have been most likely to observe Joseph’s family and the Egyptians mourning (verse 11). However, since its location is not certain, it is best to translate “beyond the Jordan” in a general way (like the Hebrew text is).

Also be consistent with how you spelled the name of the man named Canaan in 9:18, 22, 25-27; 10:6, 15, and compare that to how you translated “the Canaanites” in 10:18-19; 12:6; 13:7; 15:21; 24:3, 37; 28:1, 6, 8; 34:30; 36:2; 38:2; 46:10; 50:11.
