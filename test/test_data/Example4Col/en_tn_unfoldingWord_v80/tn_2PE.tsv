front:intro	mvk9				0	# Introduction to 2 Peter\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of 2 Peter\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n1. Reminder to live godly lives because God has enabled us to do so (1:3–15)\n1. Reminder of the veracity of apostolic teaching (1:16–21)\n1. Prediction of false teachers (2:1–3)\n1. Examples of divine judgment (2:4–10a)\n1. Description and denunciation of false teachers (2:10b–22)\n1. Reminder that Jesus will return at the right time (3:1–13)\n1. Concluding exhortation to live godly lives (3:14–17)\n\n### Who wrote the book of 2 Peter?\n\nThe author identified himself as Simon Peter. Simon Peter was an apostle. He also wrote the book of 1 Peter. Peter probably wrote this letter while in a prison in Rome, just before he died. Peter called this letter his second letter, so we can date it after 1 Peter. He addressed the letter to the same audience as his first letter. The audience probably was Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.\n\n### What is the book of 2 Peter about?\n\nPeter wrote this letter to encourage believers to live good lives. He warned them about false teachers who were saying Jesus was taking too long to return. He told them that Jesus was not slow in returning. Instead, God was giving people time to repent so that they would be saved.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Peter” or “Second Peter.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Second Letter from Peter” or “The Second Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Who were the people Peter spoke against?\n\nIt is possible that the people Peter spoke against were those who would become known as Gnostics. These teachers distorted the teachings of Scripture for their own gain. They lived in immoral ways and taught others to do the same.\n\n### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?\n\nThe doctrine of Scripture is a very important one. 2 Peter helps readers to understand that while each writer of Scripture had his own distinct way of writing, God is the true author of Scripture (1:20-21).\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Peter. Also, the word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of 2 Peter?\n\nFor the following verses, there are differences between some of the ancient manuscripts. The ULT text follows the reading that most scholars consider to be original and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the language of wider communication in the region, translators may want to consider using the reading found in that version. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.\n* “to be kept in chains of lower darkness until the judgment” (2:4). Some ancient manuscripts have, “to be kept in pits of lower darkness until the judgment.”\n* “They enjoy their deceitful actions while they are feasting with you” (2:13). Some manuscripts have, “They enjoy their actions while they are feasting with you in love feasts.”\n* “Bosor” (2:15). A few other manuscripts read, “Beor.”\n* “The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be revealed” (3:10). Other manuscripts have, “The elements will be burned with fire, and the earth and the deeds in it will be burned up.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	wjw5				0	# 2 Peter 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n2. Reminder to live good lives, because God has enabled us to do so (1:3–15)\n3. Reminder of the veracity of apostolic teaching (1:16–21)\n\nPeter begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his name, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. That was the way people typically began letters at this time.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Knowledge of God\n\nHaving experiential knowledge of God means to belong to him or to have a relationship with him. Here, “knowledge” is more than just mentally knowing about God. It is the knowledge of personal relationship in which God saves a person and gives him grace and peace. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/know]])\n\n### Living godly lives\n\nPeter teaches that God has given believers all that they need for living godly lives. Therefore, believers should do everything they can to obey God more and more. If believers continue to do this, then they will be effective and productive through their relationship with Jesus. However, if believers do not continue living godly lives, then it is as though they have forgotten what God did through Christ to save them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The truth of Scripture\n\nPeter teaches that the prophecies in Scripture were not made up by men. The Holy Spirit revealed God’s message to the men who spoke them or wrote them down. Also, Peter and the other apostles did not make up the stories they told people about Jesus. They witnessed what Jesus did and heard God call Jesus his son.

If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that.

In combination with the negatives **neither** and **nor**, they are used together to emphasize that this person will not be unproductive but will experience great benefits from knowing Jesus. If it is confusing in your language to use two words together that mean the same thing, you could just use one word with that meaning. Alternate translation: “not unproductive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:8	ppd8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ἐπίγνωσιν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **knowledge** using a verbal phrase.

1:9	h6fn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τυφλός ἐστιν μυωπάζων	1	In this metaphor, Peter speaks of a person who does not possess these qualities as if the person were **blind** or **nearsighted**. He means this in a spiritual sense, that this person cannot see what is spiritually important. If that is confusing in your language, you could use a different metaphor with that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is like a blind or shortsighted person who cannot see their importance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:9	xenf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τυφλός ἐστιν μυωπάζων	1	Although the words **blind** and **nearsighted** have similar meanings, **blind** is more extreme than **nearsighted,** and a person cannot be both at the same time. If it is confusing in your language to describe someone using both of these words in this way, you could use a word like “or” between them or show how they might work together. Alternate translation: “he … is blind or nearsighted” or “he … is blindly nearsighted” or “he … is so nearsighted that he is blind to what is spiritually important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

1:10	ot7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Peter is using the term **brothers** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Be sure that this is clear in your translation so that your readers do not get the impression that Peter is addressing only men. If you use a non-figurative word such as “believers” to translate the metaphor **brothers**, you may need to use both the masculine and the feminine forms of that word in your language. If you retain the metaphor, you could state “my brothers and sisters.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:10	raa1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	βεβαίαν ὑμῶν τὴν κλῆσιν καὶ ἐκλογὴν ποιεῖσθαι	1	The words **calling** and **election** share similar meanings and both refer to God choosing believers to belong to him.

2:intro	mv79				0	# 2 Peter 2 General Notes\n\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n\n1. Prediction of false teachers (2:1–3)\n1. Examples of divine judgment (2:4–10a)\n1. Description and denunciation of false teachers (2:10b–22)\n\nPeter continues this letter in [2:1–3](../02/01.md) by predicting that false teachers will try to deceive the believers, just as false prophets did during the time true prophets were writing the Old Testament. Then in [2:4–10a](../02/04.md) Peter describes examples of God punishing those who acted similarly to the coming false teachers. Peter then closes this section in [2:10b–22](../02/10.md) by describing the wicked character and deeds of these false teachers.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Flesh\n\n“Flesh” is a metaphor for a person’s sinful nature. It is not the physical part of man that is sinful. “Flesh” represents the human nature that rejects all things godly and desires what is sinful. This is the condition of all humans before they receive the Holy Spirit by believing in Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])\n\n### Implicit information\n\nThere are several analogies in [2:4–8](../02/04.md) that are difficult to understand if the Old Testament has not yet been translated. Further explanation may be necessary. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Peter assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, Balaam was hired by wicked kings to curse the Israelites. When God did not allow Balaam to do so, he used wicked women to seduce the Israelites into sexual immorality and idol worship so that God would punish them for their disobedience. Balaam did these wicked things because he wanted to be paid by the wicked kings, but he was eventually killed by the Israelites when they conquered the land of Canaan. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story.
