Final exhortation and letter closing (6:20–21)\n\n### Who wrote the book of 1 Timothy?\n\nThe author identifies himself as Paul the apostle. Paul was originally from the city of Tarsus but lived in Jerusalem. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee, and he persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. Eventually, he was arrested and taken to Rome, the capital of the empire. After several years in jail, he was released. Paul wrote this letter sometime after his release and before he was arrested again and executed.\n\nPaul wrote this letter to Timothy, who was Paul’s disciple and his close friend. Timothy was in Ephesus during this time. Paul may have written other letters to Timothy, but this is the earliest one that we still have. That is why it is known as 1 Timothy or First Timothy.\n\n### What is the book of 1 Timothy about?\n\nPaul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed included church worship, qualifications for church leaders, and how to deal with false teachers. This letter shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches while Timothy himself trained other leaders.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Timothy” or “First Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to Timothy” or “A First Letter from Paul to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Who were the false teachers?\n\nThe only information we have about who these false teachers were and what they taught comes from this letter and from the letters called 2 Timothy and Titus. These false teachers were Christians, or at least claimed to be Christians. They taught by using texts and stories that Paul considered unreliable, and they spoke about and debated things that Paul considered unimportant. According to this letter, they told people not to marry and to avoid eating certain kinds of food. Paul critiques them for causing divisions and for desiring to gain money. Since the only information about the false teachers and what they taught come from this letter and 2 Timothy and Titus, it is best not to specify precisely what false teaching this was. You should preserve what Paul said about the false teaching without making it fit into a type of false teaching that might be familiar in your area.\n\n### What kind of church structure was Paul describing?\n\nSome Christian churches are organized with strictly defined roles and hierarchies for leaders and relationships between individual churches. Other Christian churches are organized with fewer defined roles and loose relationships between individual churches. What Paul says in this letter relates to these differing church structures, since Paul speaks about several types of leaders and what their qualifications are. He specifically mentions “overseers,” “elders,” and “deacons.” Christians debate whether “overseers” and “elders” are different words for the same type of leader, whether Paul was referring to strictly defined roles with these words, and whether all churches had all these kinds of leaders. Consider how you might translate these titles, especially if your language already has words for specific types of church leaders. If possible, do not use titles that favor one specific group of churches over others. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/overseer]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/elder]], and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/deacon]])\n\n### What was Paul’s attitude towards women in the church?\n\nThis letter is significant when Christians debate the roles women should have within the church. Some Christians believe that Paul prohibited women from serving as leaders and teachers over the church. Other Christians believe that Paul was condemning a specific situation in Ephesus, where women were spreading false teaching, and they argue that Paul usually wanted women to teach and lead in the church. Other Christians believe that Paul wanted women to serve as leaders in some ways but not in other ways. What is clear is that Paul worked closely with women who were serving and leading in certain ways (for example, see what Paul says about Phoebe in [Romans 16:1–2](../rom/16/01.md)). So, Paul did not think that women were inferior or not worthy of serving. However, he does include certain restrictions related to women (and men!) serving as leaders and teachers. While translators cannot ignore their own views, it is important to represent what Paul wrote as carefully as possible. If possible, then, a translation should allow for multiple interpretations, just as what Paul wrote allows for multiple interpretations.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ”?\n\nPaul uses the spatial metaphor “in Christ” several times in this letter. This metaphor emphasizes that believers are as closely united to Christ as if they were inside him. Paul believes that this is true for all believers, and sometimes he uses “in Christ” simply to identify that what he is speaking about is true for those who believe in Jesus. At other times he emphasizes union with Christ as the means or the basis for some statement or exhortation. See the notes on specific verses for help in understanding the contextual meaning of “in Christ.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### What does Paul mean when he uses the word “faith”?\n\nPaul uses the abstract noun “faith” 19 times in this letter. The word “faith” could refer to the act of having “faith” or to the content of the “faith,” that is, what it is that Christians believe. In many places in 1 Timothy, Christians debate which meaning Paul intended. In each of these places, a translation note provides examples of how to express the two possible meanings, and the UST models how to express the idea when the word “faith” refers to the act of believing. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Who receives the “love” that Paul mentions in the letter?\n\nPaul uses the abstract noun “love” five times in this letter. He could mean that believers should love each other or that they should love God or that they should love both God and each other. If possible, though, you should express the idea so that it could include all of these possibilities. If you must express whom people are to love, it is recommended that you indicate that it is fellow believers. The UST models how to express the idea in that way. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/love]])\n\n### To whom does Paul refer with the words “we,” “us,” and “our”?\n\nPaul always uses the first-person plural to refer to both himself and Timothy, and often he includes other believers as well. So, you should always use the inclusive form of the first-person plural in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### When is “you” singular, and when is “you” plural?\n\nSince this letter is addressed to an individual, Timothy, every form of “you” throughout the letter is singular except for “you” in the final blessing in [6:21](../06/21.md). A note will point out this occurrence of a plural form of “you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 1 Timothy?\n\nIn the following verses, ancient manuscripts do not all have the same words. The ULT uses the words that are found in most of the earliest manuscripts. When you translate these verses, you should compare the ULT with any translations with which your readers may be familiar to see what your readers may expect. Unless there is a good reason to use the alternate words, you should follow the ULT. See the footnotes and notes at each of these verses for more information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n* “the only God” (1:17). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the only wise God.”\n* “I am speaking the truth in Christ” (2:7). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “I am speaking the truth.”\n* “not a brawler” (3:3). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “not a brawler, not greedy.”\n* “Who” (3:16). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “God.”\n* “struggle” (4:10). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “are reproached.”\n* “in love” (4:12). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “in love, in spirit.”\n* “believing woman” (5:16). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “believing man or woman.”\n* “a means of gain” (6:5). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “a means of gain. Withdraw from such.”\n* “that” (6:7). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “it is clear that.”\n* “God” (6:17). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the living God.”\n* “the real life” (6:19). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “eternal life.”\n* “you” (6:21). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “you. Amen.”
1:intro	a4v2				0	# 1 Timothy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Letter opening (1:1–2)\n2. Paul urges Timothy to condemn false teachers (1:3–11)\n      * Paul commands Timothy to silence the false teachers (1:3–7)\n      * The purpose of the law (1:8–11)\n3. Paul thanks Jesus and praises God (1:12–17)\n4. Paul warns and encourages Timothy (1:18–20)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The prophecies about Timothy\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), Paul indicates that there were prophecies about Timothy. Paul implies that the prophecies are related to how Timothy will faithfully serve God by proclaiming the gospel. It is not clear when these prophecies were given. They may have been given before Timothy was born, when he was a child, when he became a believer, or when he was commissioned to serve with Paul. It is also not clear who gave these prophecies. When you translate this verse, it is best to refer to these prophecies with as few details as Paul gives.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Spiritual children\n\nIn [1:2](../01/02.md), Paul calls Timothy a “genuine child in the faith.” He means that Timothy is like a legitimate son to him in the context of their faith in Jesus. The phrase implies that Paul is a mentor to Timothy and that Timothy is a good student. When Paul again calls Timothy “child” in [1:18](../01/18.md), he means something very similar: Paul is Timothy’s mentor in the context of their faith in Jesus. Since the use of family language for fellow believers is an important metaphor in the New Testament, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Fighting the good fight\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), Paul exhorts Timothy to “fight the good fight.” He compares how Timothy must serve God by proclaiming the gospel to how soldiers fight in a war. He implies that Timothy will experience conflict, danger, and hardship and that he must obey God and Paul as a soldier obeys his commanders. Since Paul uses warfare language to refer to the Christian life in many verses, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Shipwrecked regarding the faith\n\nIn [1:19](../01/19.md), Paul refers to people who “have shipwrecked regarding the faith.” As a ship breaks apart and sinks, the faith of these people has ceased to function properly. They do not believe in Jesus any longer. If your readers would not be familiar with shipwrecks, you could consider using a comparable metaphor or stating the meaning plainly. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n\n### The list in [1:9–10](../01/09.md)\n\nIn these verses, Paul provides a list of some of the kinds of people for whom the law was given. Paul gives four pairs of words connected with “and,” six individual words, and then a concluding phrase. You may need to break this long list into multiple different sentences, as the UST does. If you do, you could still preserve the general structure of Paul’s list, as the UST does in most places. Consider how you would include a list of this kind in your language.
1:1	i3zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person\t	Παῦλος, ἀπόστολος	1	In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul. I am an apostle”
1:1	xl6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Θεοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **command**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as it was commanded by God our Savior and by the Lord Jesus Christ”
1:1	wb8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **Savior** who saves us. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who saves us”
1:1	t9cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμῶν	1	In this letter, Paul uses the words **our**, “we,” and “us” to refer either to Timothy and himself or else to all believers, which would also include the two of them. So, use the inclusive forms of those words throughout your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:1	sw77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν	1	Here, **our hope** refers to the person in whom we have hope. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translations: “of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one in whom we have hope”
1:1	kdwn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Christ, in whom we hope”
1:2	p3h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Τιμοθέῳ	1	In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would name those to whom they sent the letter, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here, starting a new sentence. Alternate translation: “This letter is for you, Timothy”
1:2	pyi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γνησίῳ τέκνῳ	1	Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Timothy were his **genuine child**. Paul means that he is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves Timothy in the way a father loves his **child**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who is like a genuine child to me” or “truly my spiritual son”
1:2	lf30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	γνησίῳ	1	Here, the word **genuine** indicates that the **child** is considered to be someone’s child in the full legal sense. For example, a chlid born to an unmarried woman would not be considered **genuine**. In the context of the metaphor, the word indicates that Timothy has acted as a son should act toward Paul. If your readers would not be familiar with the concept of a **genuine child**, you could use the name of a similar concept in your culture or you could use a more general phrase. Alternate translation: “legitimate” or “true”
1:2	sbnq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “since we both believe” or “as we together believe”
1:2	rd5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1	After stating his name and the name of the person to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing for Timothy. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May you experience grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord” or “I pray that grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord will always be with you”
1:2	zx37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **Grace**, **mercy**, and **peace**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “May you be treated graciously, mercifully, and peacefully by God the Father and by Christ Jesus our Lord”
1:2	p4lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1	**Father** is an important title for **God the Father** that describes his relationship with **Jesus**, his Son.
1:3-4	kmpv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθὼς παρεκάλεσά σε προσμεῖναι ἐν Ἐφέσῳ, πορευόμενος εἰς Μακεδονίαν, ἵνα παραγγείλῃς τισὶν μὴ ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν & μηδὲ προσέχειν μύθοις καὶ γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις, αἵτινες ἐκζητήσεις παρέχουσι μᾶλλον ἢ οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ, τὴν ἐν πίστει	1	Here Paul begins a comparison using the phrase **Just as**, but he does not complete the comparison. However, he implies that **Just as** he **urged** Timothy to do these things at an earlier time, now he urges Timothy to continue to do these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implied part of the comparison explicit. You could include it at the beginning of the sentence, at the end of the sentence, or somewhere else. Alternate translation: “I urge you now, just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you earlier, to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith.” or “Just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently, and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith, so now I urge you again to do those things.”
1:3	suy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πορευόμενος εἰς Μακεδονίαν	1	Here Paul could be implying that, when he previously **urged** Timothy to remain in Ephesus, he was: (1) in Ephesus with Timothy and was about to leave for **Macedonia**. Alternate translation: “being about to leave Ephesus for Macedonia” (2) already on his way to Macedonia. In this case, Paul would be referring to a letter he had previously written to Timothy. Alternate translation: “being on my way to Macedonia”
1:3	k4tm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	πορευόμενος	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “coming” instead of **going**. Alternate translation: “coming”
1:3	k35a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σε	1	In this letter, with one exception, the words **you**, “your,” and “yourself” refer to Timothy and so are singular. A note will discuss the one exception in [6:21](../06/21.md).
1:3	v4g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν	1	The implication is that these people were teaching different things than what Paul and Timothy taught, not that they were teaching in a different way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to teach what is different from what we teach” or “to teach a different doctrine”
1:4	pw2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύθοις	1	The word **myths** refers to a certain kind of story that is generally considered to be untrustworthy. This kind of story is often about what important people did a long time ago. Often, many people in a culture know these stories but do not consider them to be reliable historical narratives. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of story, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “fictional narratives” or “traditional tales”
1:4	qpv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις	1	Paul says **endless** here as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “genealogies that seem as if they will never end” or “extremely lengthy genealogies”
1:4	ft33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	γενεαλογίαις	1	The word **genealogies** refers to lists of someone’s ancestors. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of list, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term.

1:4	yjvq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκζητήσεις	1	Here, the word translated **arguments** could refer to: (1) debates or heated discussions. Alternate translation: “debates” (2) questions or enquiries. Alternate translation: “questions” or “speculations”
1:4	qb9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **stewardship** that could: (1) be something that God has and works out. Alternate translation: “the stewardship that God carries out” (2) be given by God to his people. Alternate translation: “the stewardship from God” or “the stewardship given by God”
1:4	eu9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **stewardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure your translation fits with the interpretation you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “how God is stewarding everything” or “what God is working out”
1:4	awxg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ἐν πίστει	1	Here Paul could be implying that **the stewardship of God**: (1) is promoted or accomplished when people have **faith**. Alternate translation: “which is promoted by faith” or “which is brought about by faith” (2) is known or experienced when people have **faith**. Alternate translation: “which is known by faith” or “which people learn by faith”
1:4	p2sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐν πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the interpretation you chose in the previous note. Alternate translations: “which we promote when we believe” or “which is promoted by believing in Jesus”
1:5	myi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Here Paul uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help Timothy understand the purpose of what he is commanding him to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces background information, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “To further explain what I am saying,”
1:5	l7un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς παραγγελίας	1	Here, the phrase **the command** refers to what Paul has instructed Timothy to tell the “certain ones” in Ephesus (see [1:3–4](../01/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “of that command” or “of what I have instructed you to command them”
1:5	i9rs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐστὶν ἀγάπη	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “is that people care for each other”
1:5	t123		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “from a pure mind” or “from pure thoughts”
1:5	ar8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς	1	A **conscience** that is **good** is one that does not convict a person of doing anything wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a clean conscience” or “a conscience that is not guilty”
1:5	zziu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πίστεως ἀνυποκρίτου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from sincerely believing”
1:6	ecoy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὧν	1	The pronoun **which** refers to the pure heart, good conscience, and sincere faith in [1:5](../01/05.md). If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to those things more directly. Alternate translation: “from which things” or “from which heart, conscience, and faith”
1:6	j4z3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀστοχήσαντες	1	Paul speaks as if a pure heart, good conscience, and sincere faith were a **mark** or target that some people have **missed**. Paul means that these people have failed to attain those things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “not having gained those things”
1:6	se38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξετράπησαν εἰς	1	Here Paul speaks of abandoning what is good to focus on **foolish talk** as if it were turning away from those good things **to foolish talk**. He means that these people have stopped pursuing the good things that Paul mentioned in the previous verse and instead are focusing on things of little consequence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “have deviated and focused on” or “have been distracted by”
1:7	v28u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νομοδιδάσκαλοι	1	Here, the word **law** refers specifically to the laws that God gave the Israelites through Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “teachers of the law of Moses”
1:7	t131		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ νοοῦντες μήτε & μήτε	1	The words **not**, **neither**, and **nor** are three negative words. In this construction, the second and third negatives do not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, they give greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use three negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a triple negative here. If your language does not use three negatives in that way, you could translate with one or two negatives. Alternate translation: “understanding neither … nor”
1:7	t132		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	μήτε ἃ λέγουσιν, μήτε περὶ τίνων διαβεβαιοῦνται	1	Here, the clauses **what they are saying** and **what they insist on** mean similar things. Paul is using the two clauses together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single clause. Alternate translation: “anything that they are saying” or “any of the things that they insist on”
1:8	g1ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that Paul wishes to write about. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next topic, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now”
1:8	d6dz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ νόμος	1	Here, the word **law** refers specifically to the laws that God gave the Israelites through Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. See how you referred to this **law** in [1:7](../01/07.md). Alternate translation: “the law of Moses”
1:8	r86g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐάν τις αὐτῷ νομίμως χρῆται	1	Here Paul indicates that **the law {is} good** when people use it as God intended it to be used, that is, **lawfully**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translations: “if one uses it as it was intended to be used” or “if one uses it in the way that God intended”
1:9	m7me		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	εἰδὼς τοῦτο, ὅτι & νόμος	1	Here, the word **this** refers directly ahead to **that the law is not made for the righteous**. Paul expresses the idea in this way to emphasize what he is about to say. If using **this** to introduce an idea would be a redundancy in your language, you could omit the redundant information. Alternate translation: “knowing that”
1:9	xs94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδὼς τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **knowing this** introduces a reason why Paul and other believers know that “the law if good” (see [1:8](../01/08.md)).

1:9	fq4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	νόμος οὐ κεῖται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these terms by translating them either with single terms or with phrases. Alternate translations: “those who commit patricides and matricides and murders” or “people who kill other people, even their own fathers and mothers”

You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and people who do anything else that is contrary to the healthy teaching”
1:10	t147		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **teaching** could be **healthy**.

1:13	nv6k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠλεήθην	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

To indicate this, the ULT and UST put quotation marks around these words. The ULT also uses a dash to indicate that the words **of whom I am the first** are not part of the **word** that Paul shares with Timothy.

Alternate translation: “who are like a child to me” or “my spiritual son”
1:18	y6jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰς προαγούσας ἐπὶ σὲ προφητείας	1	Here Paul implies that some people had given prophecies about Timothy sometime **earlier**. These prophecies may have been spoken before Timothy was born, before Timothy became a believer, or when Timothy officially joined Paul to proclaim the gospel.

Alternate translation: “the prophecies about you that people gave before” or “what some people prophesied about you some time ago”
1:18	m744		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν αὐταῖς	1	Here, the phrase **in them** could indicate that Timothy should **fight the good fight**: (1) as the prophecies indicated that he would. Alternate translation: “in line with them” or “just as they indicated,” (2) by means of the prophecies, which function like weapons in the **fight**. Alternate translation: “by means of them” or “with them as weapons” (3) with the prophecies as his motivation. Alternate translation: “by remembering them” or “encouraged by them”
1:18	w2ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	στρατεύῃ & τὴν καλὴν στρατείαν	1	Paul speaks about Timothy serving God by preaching the gospel and by confronting false teachers as if he were fighting a **good fight**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. See how you translated this phrase in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: “a clean conscience” or “a conscience that is not guilty”
1:19	h8iu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἥν	1	Here, the pronoun **which** could refer: (1) just to **good conscience**. Alternate translation: “which conscience” (2) to both **good conscience** and **faith**. Alternate translation: “both of which”
1:19	e63r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τινες	1	Paul is using the adjective **some** as a noun to mean some people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “some men and women”

1:20	pv7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὑμέναιος & Ἀλέξανδρος	1	The words **Hymenaeus** and **Alexander** are the names of two men.
1:20	ty7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρέδωκα τῷ Σατανᾷ	1	To give someone over to someone else refers to transferring a person from one authority to another. Here, then, Paul says that he has transferred these two men from under the authority of the church to under the authority of **Satan**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have turned over to Satan” or “I have put under Satan’s authority”
1:20	s76c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παιδευθῶσι μὴ βλασφημεῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:intro	c6rf				0	# 1 Timothy 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Paul gives instructions about prayer and behavior in public worship (2:1–15)\n      * Command to pray for all people (2:1–7)\n      * How men should pray (2:8)\n      * How women should behave (2:9–15)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “Quiet” and “quietness”\n\nPaul uses the adjective “quiet” in [2:2](../02/02.md), and he uses the noun “quietness” in [2:11](../02/11.md) and [2:12](../02/12.md). The word “quiet” describes something that is peaceful or calm. However, Christians debate what the word “quietness” describes. First, some argue that it means something similar to what the word “quiet” means: a situation in which things are peaceful and calm. In this case, Paul is commanding the women in the church to behave in peaceful and calm ways. Second, some argue that it means something stronger than what the word “quiet” means: not speaking in a public setting. In this case, Paul is forbidding the women in the church from contributing to public conversations. If possible, use a word or phrase that could have either of these meanings. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### God desires to save “all men,” and Jesus is a ransom for “all”\n\nIn [2:4](../02/04.md), Paul writes that God desires that “all men” be saved, and in [2:6](../02/06.md), he writes that Jesus is a ransom “for all.” Christians debate whether Jesus died to save certain people specifically (either those whom God has chosen or those who will believe) or whether he died to save all people (although some may not accept this salvation). So, Paul could be using the word “all” to refer to all different kinds or groups of people, or he could be using the word “all” to refer to every human. Since Paul uses general terms in these verses, it is recommended that you also use a general term that refers to all people. If this is a significant issue in your area, you could include some of this information in a footnote.\n\n### Women in the church\n\nChristians do not agree about what women should and should not do as the church worships and functions. Some Christians believe that women are prohibited from leading and teaching publicly in these settings. Other Christians believe that women can do whatever men do in these settings. Because of that, there are many different interpretations of [2:8–15](../02/08.md). While translators cannot ignore their own beliefs, it is important to represent what Paul wrote extremely carefully. If possible, then, a translation should allow for multiple interpretations, just as what Paul wrote allows for multiple interpretations.\n\n### Women’s clothing, jewelry, and hairstyles\n\nAs in many cultures, in Paul’s culture what women wore and how they did their hair and makeup indicated certain things about them. Wearing fancy hairstyles and expensive jewelry and clothes would indicate that a woman was showing off her or her husband’s wealth. Further, she was drawing attention to herself. People would often criticize women for showing off more than was appropriate for their social status. When Paul prohibits certain types of clothing, hairstyles, and jewelry, he likely has this context in mind. He may be concerned that some women in the church are showing off, or he may want to prevent women in the church from being criticized by others. Either way, your translation should make it clear that Paul refers to clothing, jewelry, and hairstyles to prohibit showing off and drawing attention to oneself. See the notes on [2:9](../02/09.md) for translation options.\n\n### Adam and Eve\n\nIn [2:13–14](../02/13.md), Paul refers to two stories about Adam and Eve, the first humans that God created. The first story is about how God made them. He made Adam first, and then he made Eve using one of Adam’s ribs. You can read this story in [Genesis 2:5–25](../gen/02/05.md). The second story is about how Adam and Eve first sinned. A talking serpent came to Eve and convinced her to eat fruit from a specific tree, even though God had commanded them not to eat fruit from that tree. Once Eve ate the fruit, she gave some fruit to Adam, and he too ate some of it. After that, God came to them and judged them. You can read this story in [Genesis 3:1–7](../gen/03/01.md). If your readers would not be familiar with these stories, you could include some of this information in footnotes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/eve]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/adam]])\n\n### “She will be saved through childbearing”\n\nIn [2:15](../02/15.md), Paul writes that “she will be saved through childbearing.” Christians debate what Paul was claiming, and there are many interpretations of the clause. The most common interpretations are the following:\n\n1. “She” could refer to Eve or to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to how many women gave birth until eventually Mary gave birth to Jesus. In this case, God saves Eve, or women in general, by using the process of childbearing to send the Messiah, who saves everyone who believes.\n2. “She” refers to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to how women give birth to children and raise them. In this case, God saves women as they are acting as wives and mothers.\n3. “She” could refer to Eve or to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to the birth of a specific child, Jesus. In this case, God saves Eve, or women in general, by sending Jesus, who saves everyone who believes.\n4. “She” refers to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to the process of giving birth. In this case, God preserves and protects women as they give birth.\n\nIt is recommended that you follow one of the first two options, and only those two options will appear in the translation note on this issue. If possible, your translation should allow for several options.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n\n### Men and women, or husbands and wives\n\nIn [2:8–10](../02/08.md) Paul refers to “men” and “women” using plural nouns that can refer generally to male and female humans and that can also refer more specifically to husbands and wives. In [2:11–12](../02/11.md), Paul switches to the singular form: “woman.” Again, this noun can refer generally to a female human and can also refer more specifically to a wife. Some Christians believe that Paul switches to the singular form and later refers to the stories about Adam and Eve because he is giving instructions specifically to wives in [2:11–12](../02/11.md). Other Christians believe that Paul is still referring to women in general when he switches to the singular form, which he does to apply the stories about Adam and Eve to the instructions he gives to women in [2:11–12](../02/11.md). If your language has a word that could refer to women in general and more specifically to wives, you could use it here. Otherwise, you may need to choose which option to follow. In this case, you could put the other option in a footnote. See the notes on these verses for translation options.
2:1	iag7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	παρακαλῶ οὖν	1	Here, the word **therefore** introduces an exhortation that is based on what Paul has said in chapter 1. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an exhortation based on a previous section. Alternate translation: “Because of all that, I urge” or “Given what I have written, I urge”
2:1	yk2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρῶτον πάντων	1	Here Paul could be using the word **first**: (1) to indicate that what he is about to **urge** is the most important thing he will urge. Alternate translation: “most importantly” (2) to indicate that what he is about to **urge** is the first of several commands he will give. Alternate translation: “as the first of the following commands”
2:1	yjme		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	πρῶτον	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you could use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “number one”
2:1	ql7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ποιεῖσθαι δεήσεις, προσευχάς, ἐντεύξεις, εὐχαριστίας	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who should do the action, it is clear from the context that it should be Christians. Alternate translation: “that Christians make requests, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings”
2:1	i78f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ποιεῖσθαι δεήσεις, προσευχάς, ἐντεύξεις, εὐχαριστίας,	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas in this list, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “for believers to request things, pray, intercede, and thank God”
2:1	bmlg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	δεήσεις, προσευχάς, ἐντεύξεις, εὐχαριστίας	1	Here Paul uses four words that refer to four types of prayer. The word **prayers** is the most general, and the word **thanksgivings** refers to thanking God for something rather than asking for something. The words **requests** and **intercessions** both refer to asking God to do something, and they mean very similar things. Paul uses these four words to indicate that believers should be praying **for all men** in many different ways. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the idea by referring to two or three types of prayer. Alternate translation: “prayers and thanksgivings” or “for prayers, requests, and thanksgivings”
2:1	t183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “men and women”
2:2	dhaq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πάντων τῶν ἐν ὑπεροχῇ ὄντων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “all the ones being authorized to govern”
2:2	h3zt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which believers should pray **for kings and all the ones being in authority**.

2:2	c35r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἤρεμον καὶ ἡσύχιον βίον διάγωμεν ἐν πάσῃ εὐσεβείᾳ καὶ σεμνότητι	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **life**, **godliness**, and **dignity**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “we may live peacefully and quietly, in a godly and dignified way”
2:2	g4va		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἤρεμον καὶ ἡσύχιον βίον	1	The terms **peaceful** and **quiet** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “a very peaceful life” or “a completely quiet life”
2:3	i1sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο	1	The pronoun **This** refers to praying as Paul has urged in [2:1–2](../02/01.md). If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to this idea more directly. Alternate translation: “That kind of prayer” or “Praying for those things”
2:3	tiq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καλὸν καὶ ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **before God our Savior** could go with: (1) just **acceptable**. Alternate translation: “is good, and it is acceptable before God our Savior” (2) both **good** and **acceptable**. Alternate translation: “is good before God our Savior and acceptable to him”
2:3	t186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	καλὸν καὶ ἀπόδεκτον	1	The terms **good** and **acceptable** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very good” or “extremely acceptable”
2:3	s7to		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **before God** refers to God’s evaluation or view about something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the eyes of God our Savior” or “to God our Savior”
2:3	vxzg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **Savior** who saves us. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who saves us”
2:4	g1mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὃς	1	Here, the word **who** could primarily introduce: (1) a further description of God, who is “our Savior” (see [2:3](../02/03.md)). Alternate translation: “he who” (2) a reason why praying for all people is “good and acceptable” to God (see [2:3](../02/03.md)). Alternate translation: “since he”
2:4	i3ze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πάντας ἀνθρώπους & σωθῆναι, καὶ & ἐλθεῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be God. Alternate translation: “that he might save all men and that they might come”
2:4	t188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πάντας ἀνθρώπους	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “everyone” or “all men and women”
2:4	n26m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν & ἐλθεῖν	1	Paul speaks of **knowledge of the truth** as if it were a place where people could **come**. He means that God desires that all people gain **knowledge of the truth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to acquire knowledge” or “to gain knowledge”
2:4	z126		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **knowledge** and **truth**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “to learn the true teachings”
2:5	ar0b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a basis for Paul’s claim in the previous verse that God desires all people to be saved and to know the truth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a basis for a claim. Alternate translation: “We know that because” or “That claim is supported by this:”
2:5	t666		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	εἷς καὶ μεσίτης Θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **mediator** who mediates between **God** and **men**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and one who mediates between God and men”
2:5	t191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “of people”
2:5	t192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄνθρωπος Χριστὸς Ἰησοῦς	1	Here Paul uses the word **man** to emphasize that **Christ Jesus** is human, just like the **men** for whom he functions as a mediator. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus, who also is human”
2:6	u8r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δοὺς ἑαυτὸν	1	Here, the phrase **having given himself** implies that Jesus died willingly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having allowed himself to die” or “having died willingly”
2:6	vz12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀντίλυτρον ὑπὲρ πάντων	1	Here Paul speaks as if Jesus were a price or **ransom** he himself gave to free **all** from someone or something that owned or controlled them. He means that Jesus obtained forgiveness for his people’s sins and keeps those sins from controlling them. This is an important biblical image, so if possible preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “as if he were a ransom to set all free from sin”
2:6	ehsu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντων	1	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun to mean all people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “all men and women”
2:6	fm1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ μαρτύριον	1	Here, the word **testimony** could refer to: (1) people giving testimony about what Jesus did. Alternate translation: “about which people testify” (2) what Jesus did, giving testimony to how God wants to save all people. Alternate translation: “which testifies” or “which testifies that God desires to save all”
2:6	sgiw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ μαρτύριον	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “which is testified to”
2:6	fq7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καιροῖς ἰδίοις	1	Here, the phrase translated **in its own times** indicates that something happens at an appropriate time or period of time. More specifically, the **times** could be appropriate because: (1) they fit with **the testimony**. Alternate translation: “at the times appropriate to it” or “during the time appropriate to it” (2) God chose them. Alternate translation: “at the times that God chose” or “during the time that God chose”
2:7	ez96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	εἰς ὃ ἐτέθην ἐγὼ κῆρυξ καὶ ἀπόστολος (ἀλήθειαν λέγω ἐν Χριστῷ, οὐ ψεύδομαι), διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	In this verse, Paul interrupts himself to affirm strongly that he is telling the truth. The ULT indicates this by using dashes. Most likely, Paul is affirming that everything he writes in this verse is true. Consider where you would naturally put an affirmation like this. Alternate translation: “for which—I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying—I was made a herald and an apostle, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth”
2:7	qxv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἰς ὃ	1	Here, the pronoun **which** refers back to “the testimony” in the previous verse. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to “the testimony” more directly. Alternate translation: “for which testimony”
2:7	iz4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐτέθην ἐγὼ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) Jesus did it. Alternate translation: “Christ made me” (2) God the Father did it. Alternate translation: “God made me”
2:7	cbn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κῆρυξ	1	A **herald** is someone who is sent out to announce a message. If your readers would not be familiar with a person who performs this kind of task, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translations: “an announcer” or “a messenger”
2:7	yllf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἀλήθειαν λέγω ἐν Χριστῷ, οὐ ψεύδομαι	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea in negative form. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses into one strong statement. Alternate translation: “I am speaking the whole trust in Christ” or “in Christ I am not lying at all”
2:7	jwly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀλήθειαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “truthfully”
2:7	hb97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe his union with **Christ**. In this case, Paul claims that he is **speaking the truth** as surely as he is **in Christ**, or united to Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that Paul is referring to his union with Christ to strengthen his claim to be speaking the truth. Alternate translation: “as one who is united to Christ” or “in my union with Christ”
2:7	difu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **in Christ**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts do not include these words. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
2:7	h18q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	Here, the phrase **in faith and truth** could provide: (1) the content of what Paul teaches. Alternate translation: “who teaches about faith and truth” (2) the manner in which Paul teaches. Alternate translation: “who is faithful and true”
2:7	mbz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	Here, the phrase **faith and truth** could: (1) refer to two distinct things that Paul teaches. Alternate translation: “in faith and in truth” (2) express a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **truth** tells what the **faith** is like. Alternate translation: “in the true faith”
2:7	t201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **faith** and **truth**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Make sure your translation fits with the options you chose in the previous two notes. Alternate translation: “concerning what they should trust and what they should accept as true”
2:8	vu5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a further development of what Paul has said about praying for people in [2:1–7](../02/01.md). Now, he gives commands concerning how people should pray. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of development, or you could leave **Therefore** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” or “In light of that”
2:8	a841		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἄνδρας	1	Here the word **men** refers specifically to males. The term does not refer to people in general, since Paul next addresses women specifically. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that refers specifically to adults who are male. Alternate translations: “the males”
2:8	j49h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Here Paul implies that **every place** is any location where the believers are worshiping God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “in every place of worship” or “in every location where worship is happening”
2:8	unw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας	1	In Paul’s culture, **lifting up** one’s **hands** was a common posture for someone who was praying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a common posture for prayer in your culture, or you could explain the meaning of this posture. Alternate translation: “folding holy hands” or “lifting up holy hands to pray”
2:8	yzg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας	1	Paul describes as holy one part of the person, the **hands**, to indicate that the entire person is to be holy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “being holy as they lift up their hands” or “lifting up their hands as men who are holy”
2:8	j5l3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χωρὶς ὀργῆς καὶ διαλογισμοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **anger** and **argument**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “without being angry and arguing”
2:8	a8cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διαλογισμοῦ	1	Here, the word translated **argument** could be describing: (1) quarrels or conflicts. Alternate translation: “conflict” (2) doubts. Alternate translation: “doubt”
2:9	t207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡσαύτως γυναῖκας & κοσμεῖν	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the previous verse if it would be clearer in your language. If you do so, you may need to end the previous verse with a semicolon or period. Paul could be implying that: (1) what follows is how he wants the women to behave. Alternate translation: “likewise I want the women to adorn” (2) what follows is how he wants the women to pray. Alternate translation: “likewise I want the women to pray, adorning”
2:9	imj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ αἰδοῦς καὶ σωφροσύνης	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **modesty** and **self-control**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “modestly and in a self-controlled way”
2:9	nlyn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν, καὶ χρυσῷ, ἢ μαργαρίταις, ἢ ἱματισμῷ πολυτελεῖ	1	Here Paul gives examples of specific types of hairstyles, jewelry, and clothing that, in his culture, could have indicated that a woman was showing off her wealth, power, or beauty. These types of hairstyles, jewelry, and clothing may not be used in your culture, or they may not indicate that a woman is showing off in your culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate more explicitly why Paul is using these examples. Alternate translation: “not by being ostentatious or showy by wearing braids and gold or pearls or expensive clothing” or “not by showing off with braids and gold or pearls or expensive clothing”
2:9	sw21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν	1	In Paul’s culture, women used many different kinds of hairstyles. People considered some of them to be more elaborate and ostentatious than others. Paul implies with the word **braids** that he is referring to a hairstyle that people would consider to be elaborate or ostentatious. Because it is not clear exactly what kind of hairstyle Paul had in mind, you could use a general word or phrase that refers to this kind of hairstyle. Alternate translations: “not in fancy hairstyles” or “not in elaborate hairstyles”
2:9	t210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	χρυσῷ	1	Here Paul is referring to ornaments or jewelry made out of **gold**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “gold ornaments”
2:9	rf5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μαργαρίταις	1	The word **pearls** refers to beautiful and valuable mineral balls that people use as jewelry. If your readers would not be familiar with **pearls**, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “jewelry” or “valuable beads”
2:10	rfb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἀλλ’ ὃ πρέπει γυναιξὶν ἐπαγγελλομέναις θεοσέβειαν, δι’ ἔργων ἀγαθῶν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could state how the women are supposed to adorn themselves before you indicate why this is **proper**. If you use the following alternate translation, you should delete the dash before it. Alternate translation: “but through good works, which is proper for women professing godliness”
2:10	j2v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ὃ	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the previous verse if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but to adorn themselves—as”
2:10	d4w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὃ πρέπει γυναιξὶν ἐπαγγελλομέναις θεοσέβειαν, δι’ ἔργων ἀγαθῶν	1	Here Paul implies that the women should “adorn themselves” **through good works**. He speaks of these **good works** as if they were articles of clothing in order to indicate that it should be **good works** that characterize these women, just as clothing characterizes people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as is proper for women professing godliness—to be characterized by good works”
2:10	g35m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	θεοσέβειαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **godliness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to be godly”
2:11	k6mj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	γυνὴ & μανθανέτω	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “A woman must learn”
2:11	poen		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	γυνὴ	1	The word **woman** represents Christian women in general, not one particular woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “believing women” or “female Christians”
2:11	uo6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γυνὴ	1	Here, the word translated **woman** could refer: (1) generally to any female believer. Alternate translation: “women who believe” (2) specifically to any woman who is married. This is indicated by the switch from the plural “women” in the previous verses to the singular “woman” here. Alternate translation: “a wife” or “wives”
2:11	o4md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ	1	Here, the word translated **quietness** could describe: (1) learning unobtrusively and peacefully. Paul used a similar word (“quiet”) in [2:2](../02/02.md), where it described a life that is calm and peaceful. Alternate translation: “calmly” or “in peace” (2) learning without speaking. Alternate translation: “in silence” or “without speaking”
2:11	gb7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **quietness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “quietly”
2:11	tasg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ	1	Here Paul does not state to whom or what the women are to be **in all submission**. If possible, you also should not express to whom or what they are to be **in all submission**. If you must include the object of **submission**, Paul could imply that the **submission** is to: (1) the leaders and teachers of the church. Alternate translation: “in all submission to the leaders” or “in all submission to the people who teach” (2) husbands (or other close male relatives). Alternate translation: “in all submission to their husbands”
2:11	c7sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **submission**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “always submitting”
2:12	upkq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a development of what Paul wrote in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of development, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Even more,”
2:12	vjk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	γυναικὶ	1	The word **woman** represents Christian women in general, not one particular woman. See how you expressed the idea in [2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: “believing women” or “female Christians”
2:12	j7p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γυναικὶ & ἀνδρός	1	Here, just as in [2:11](../02/11.md), the word translated **woman** could refer: (1) generally to any female believer. In this case, the word **man** refers generally to any male believer. Alternate translation: “women who believe … men who believe” (2) specifically to any woman who is married. This is indicated by the switch from the plural “women” in [2:9–10](../02/09.md) to the singular “woman” in [2:11](../02/11.md) and here. In this case, the word **man** refers to the wife’s husband. Alternate translation: “a wife … her husband” or “wives … their husbands”
2:12	j8s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διδάσκειν	1	Here Paul could be implying that women are not permitted **to teach**: (1) men. Alternate translation: “to teach a man” (2) anyone during a public meeting of believers. Alternate translation: “to teach anyone when believers gather together to worship”
2:12	hvzf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐθεντεῖν	1	Here, the word translated **to have authority over** could refer to: (1) any kind of rule or leadership. Alternate translation: “to be an authority over” or “to lead” (2) dominating or exercising abusive authority. Alternate translation: “to dominate” or “to control”
2:12	kkg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ εἶναι	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “I require her to be”
2:12	t216		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶναι ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ	1	Here, just as in [2:11](../02/11.md), the word translated **quietness** could describe: (1) being unobtrusive and peaceful. Paul used a similar word (“quiet”) in [2:2](../02/02.md), where it described a life that is calm and peaceful. Alternate translation: “to avoid interrupting” or “to be in peace” (2) not speaking. Alternate translation: “to be in silence” or “to avoid speaking”
2:12	fmoc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **quietness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “quiet”
2:13	c8p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a support or basis for the commands that Paul has given. This support comes from the story in the Old Testament that tells how God created the first humans. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a support or basis for commands. Alternate translation: “In support of what I have commanded, the Scriptures record that” or “Indeed,”
2:13	r17s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἀδὰμ & πρῶτος ἐπλάσθη, εἶτα Εὕα	1	Here Paul refers to a story found in [Genesis 2:5–25](../gen/02/05.md). In this story, when God made the first humans, he created a man named **Adam**. After that, he created a woman named **Eve**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reference more explicit or include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the original man, Adam, was formed first, before the original woman, Eve” or “as the story in Genesis shows, Adam was formed first, then Eve”
2:13	iv31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἀδὰμ & ἐπλάσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear that it was God. Alternate translation: “God formed Adam”
2:13	v7v6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἶτα Εὕα	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “then Eve was formed”
2:14	rnkm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη, ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα, ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	Here Paul refers to a story found in [Genesis 3:1–7](../gen/03/01.md). In this story, a talking serpent approaches Eve and convinces her to eat fruit that God had commanded her and Adam not to eat. She ate some of it, and then she gave some to Adam, and he also ate some of it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reference more explicit or include some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Adam was not deceived by the serpent, but the woman, Eve, having been deceived, came into transgression by eating the fruit that God had forbidden” or “as the next story in Genesis shows, Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, came into transgression”
2:14	wq5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη & ἐξαπατηθεῖσα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, the story that Paul is referring to indicates that a talking serpent, who is sometimes identified as Satan, did it. Alternate translation: “the serpent did not deceive Adam … when the serpent deceived her”
2:14	n6td		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	Here Paul speaks as if **transgression** were a location that Eve **came into**. He means that she committed a **transgression**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “committed a transgression”
2:14	t221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **transgression**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “transgressed”
2:15	krx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces something good that will happen in contrast to the bad things that Paul described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Despite that,”
2:15	t222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	σωθήσεται & μείνωσιν	1	Here Paul uses both the singular form **she** and the plural form **they**. It could be that: (1) the pronoun **she** refers to Eve, and the pronoun **they** refers to women in general. Alternate translation: “the woman Eve will be saved … women remain” (2) both the pronouns **she** and **they** refer to women in general. Alternate translation: “women will be saved … these women remain” (3) the pronoun **she** refers to Eve as a representative of all women, and the pronoun **they** refers to all women. Alternate translation: “she and all other women will be saved … they remain”
2:15	u8iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σωθήσεται & διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας	1	Christians debate the meaning of this clause. For some of the possible interpretations, see the chapter introduction. The two most likely interpretations are that: (1) **she** (Eve or women in general) **will be saved** by God, who will use **childbearing** as the means by which he sends the Messiah into the world. In this case, **childbearing** describes one means by which God accomplishes salvation. Alternate translation: “she will be saved through how the Messiah came by means of women bearing children” (2) **she** (women in general) **will be saved** spiritually as they have children and act as mothers. In this case, **childbearing** describes the circumstances in which the women **will be saved**. Alternate translation: “they will be saved while they give birth and raise children”
2:15	n818		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σωθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “God will save her”
2:15	iqcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐὰν μείνωσιν	1	If the word **she** earlier in this verse refers specifically to Eve, then Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and all other women will be saved too, if they remain”
2:15	i0ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν	1	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that women might **remain in** these things, or they may not. He has already specified the result for if they do **remain in** these things: they **will be saved**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different form that introduces a true possibility. Alternate translation: “supposing that” or “given that”
2:15	sl57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει, καὶ ἀγάπῃ, καὶ ἁγιασμῷ, μετὰ σωφροσύνης	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **faith**, **love**, **holiness**, and **self-control**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “they persevere in believing in the Messiah, loving others, and living in a holy way along with being self-controlled”
2:15	a69o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετὰ σωφροσύνης	1	Here, the phrase **with self-control** could provide: (1) the fourth and last item in the list. Alternate translation: “and self-control” (2) the manner in which the women should **remain in faith and love and holiness**. Alternate translation: “and act with self-control as they do those things” (3) the manner in which the women should remain in **holiness**. Alternate translation: “characterized by self-control”
3:intro	d9db				0	# 1 Timothy 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Paul gives instructions about qualifications for church leaders (3:1–16)\n      * Qualifications for overseers (3:1–7)\n      * Qualifications for deacons (3:8–13)\n      * The reason for the letter and the mystery of godliness (3:14–16)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [3:16](../03/16.md), which is probably a quotation from a Christian confession or hymn.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Overseers and deacons\n\nIn this chapter, Paul discusses whom to select to fill the roles of “overseer” and “deacon.” The word “overseer” refers to someone with authority, and Paul indicates that an “overseer” must be able to teach. The word “deacon” refers to someone who serves or assists others. Christians use various different terms for the people who lead and serve in the church. Before you translate this chapter, consider what terms in your language might refer clearly to the roles that Paul describes in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/overseer]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/deacon]])\n\n### Qualifications for overseers and deacons\n\nIn [3:1–7](../03/01.md), Paul provides a list of characteristics that indicate who would be a good overseer, and in [3:8–12](../03/08.md) he provides a similar list of characteristics that indicate who would be a good deacon. These lists are meant to be general guidelines, not precise lists of exactly every characteristic that an overseer or deacon must have. For example, Paul indicates that both deacons and overseers must be husbands “of one wife,” but most Christians believe that this does not mean that overseers and deacons must be married. Instead, most Christians believe that this means that, if they are married, they must be husbands “of one wife.” Consider what form you might use in your language to give a general list of qualifications.\n\n### Women as overseers and deacons\n\nChristians debate whether Paul intended women to function as overseers and deacons along with men. There are a number of issues related to this question.\n\n1. Paul often uses masculine forms in his list of qualifications, but in his language, masculine forms were often used by writers who wanted to refer to both men and women.\n2. More specifically, Paul indicates that both overseers and deacons must be husbands “of one wife.” Some Christians argue that this phrase indicates that overseers and deacons must be men. Other Christians argue that Paul also implied that overseers and deacons, if they are female, must be wives “of one husband.”\n3. Paul refers to a specific group of people in [3:11](../03/11.md) with a word that could refer more generally to women or more specifically to wives. Some Christians argue that the word means “women” and that Paul was giving specific qualifications for female deacons in this verse. Other Christians argue that the word means “wives” and that Paul was giving specific qualifications for the wives of deacons in this verse.\n\nIn the end, some Christians conclude that only men can serve as overseers and deacons. Other Christians conclude that only men can serve as overseers but that both men and women can serve as deacons. Other Christians conclude that both men and women can serve as overseers and deacons. While translators cannot ignore their own views, it is best to preserve the genders that Paul chose to use in these verses, if that is possible. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include in footnotes some of the information about the issues described above. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n\n### The generic noun “overseer”\n\nIn [3:2–7](../03/02.md), Paul lists what kind of person “the overseer” must be. As the ULT illustrates, Paul uses singular forms throughout these verses to describe any person who could be an overseer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plural forms in these verses to indicate that Paul is speaking generally. The UST illustrates one way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])\n\n### The confession or hymn in [3:16](../03/16.md)\n\nMost scholars believe that Paul quotes from an early Christian hymn or confession of faith in [3:16](../03/16.md). The ULT and UST put quote marks around these words and format them as poetry. Each clause is short and compact, and each clause implies extra information that is not always obvious. If possible, you should preserve this compact and brief form in your translation. If a form-based translation of the clause makes sense in your language, it is recommended that you do not make any implied information explicit.
3:1	ptet		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος: εἴ τις ἐπισκοπῆς ὀρέγεται, καλοῦ ἔργου ἐπιθυμεῖ.	1	Here, the clause **This word {is} trustworthy** could refer: (1) ahead to what Paul is about to say. Alternate translation: “Here is a word that is trustworthy: ‘If someone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble work’” (2) back to what Paul said in the previous verse or verses. Alternate translation: “The word I have given is trustworthy. Now if someone aspires to be an oversee, he desires a noble task”
3:1	t227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	Here, just as in [1:15](../01/15.md), **word** represents what Paul writes by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “What I write is trustworthy” or “These words are trustworthy”
3:1	t228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	εἴ τις ἐπισκοπῆς ὀρέγεται, καλοῦ ἔργου ἐπιθυμεῖ	1	These words are the **word** that Paul shares with Timothy. To indicate this, the ULT and UST put quotation marks around these words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use quotation marks or another form to indicate which words are the ones that Paul introduces as the **word**.
3:1	g7l5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ τις	1	Paul speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that this does certainly happen. If your language does not state something as a condition if it does happen, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “When someone”
3:1	vflb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τις & ἐπιθυμεῖ	1	Here, the words translated as **someone** and **he desires** do not specify whether the person is male or female. Since Christians debate whether **overseership** is something that both men and women can have, if possible you should use words and phrases here that do not indicate the person’s gender. Alternate translation: “a person … that person desires”
3:1	t229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπισκοπῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **overseership**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “be an overseer” or “to oversee the church”
3:2	cqhk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference based on what Paul said in the previous verse about how “overseership” is a “good work.” Since it is a good work, the people who do the work need to have certain qualifications. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of inference. Alternate translation: “So then,” or “Since overseership is a good work,”
3:2	m0hd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἐπίσκοπον	1	The word **overseer** represents overseers in general, not one particular overseer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for each overseer”
3:2	dff6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα	1	Here, the phrase **a husband of one wife** could indicate that an **overseer**: (1) must be sexually faith to one woman, his **wife**. Alternate translation: “a man who is faithful to his wife” (2) must have no more than **one wife** at a time. Alternate translation: “a husband of only one wife at a time” (3) must have been married no more than once, even if the marriage ended in divorce or death. Alternate translation: “a man who has been married only once”
3:2	qnq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	νηφάλιον, σώφρονα	1	The terms **temperate** and **self-controlled** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very self-controlled” or “completely temperate”
3:3	c2c7			μὴ πάροινον	1	Alternate translation: “not one who drinks much wine”
3:3	trtz			μὴ πλήκτην	1	Alternate translation: “not one who is violent” or “not one who likes to fight”
3:3	j749		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	μὴ πλήκτην	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **not a brawler**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “not a brawler, not greedy.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
3:3	pc2g			ἀφιλάργυρον	1	Alternate translation: “not greedy for money”
3:4	a8gu			προϊστάμενον	1	Alternate translations: “managing” or “taking care of”
3:4	w3un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ὑποταγῇ, μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος	1	Here, the phrase **with all dignity** could describe: (1) another characteristic of the **children**. Alternate translation: “in submission, children with all dignity” (2) another way the **children** treat their parent, the overseer. Alternate translation: “in submission who treat him with dignity” (3) how the overseer should treat his **children**. Alternate translation: “in submission as he treats them with all dignity”
3:4	p2g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ὑποταγῇ, μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **submission** and **dignity**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “who submit and are very dignified”
3:5	ma9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, the word **but** introduces an explanation about why Paul included the requirement that overseers lead their own families well. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **but** untranslated. Alternate translation: “I include that because,” or “indeed,”
3:5	duq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ & τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν, πῶς	1	Here Paul uses an imaginary situation to show that people who do not lead their own households well are not able to lead the church well. Use a natural method in your language for introducing an imaginary situation. Alternate translation: “suppose that someone does not know how to lead his own household well. In that case, how”
3:5	g5y1			προστῆναι	1	Alternate translations: “to manage” or “to take care of”
3:5	n5lt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται?	1	Paul is using the question form to strongly deny that this kind of person can **take care of the church of God**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “he will not take care of the church of God well.” or “he will certainly not be able to take care of the church of God!”
3:5	c814		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul refers to the specific **church** whom the person would be taking care of. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the church of God in his charge” or “the church of God to which he is assigned”
3:5	h05z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **church** that worships and belongs to **God**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the church that worships God”
3:6	q7hu			μὴ νεόφυτον	1	Alternate translations: “not having believed recently” or “mature in the faith”
3:6	v6f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα μὴ & εἰς κρίμα ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Here Paul refers to experiencing **judgment** as if it were falling into a hole. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that he may not be overcome … by the judgment of the devil” or “so that he may not experience … the judgment of the devil”
3:6	t241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τυφωθεὶς	1	Here Paul speaks of becoming prideful as if it were **being puffed up** by air. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “becoming conceited”
3:6	t240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τυφωθεὶς	1	Here Paul implies that **a new convert** might be **puffed up**, or prideful, because of being made an overseer so quickly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “being puffed up by becoming a leader so quickly”
3:6	al20		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	κρίμα & τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **judgment** that could be: (1) the same kind of **judgment** that **the devil** received. Alternate translation: “the judgment that the devil received” (2) a **judgment** that **the devil** administers. Alternate translation: “judgment from the devil” or “judgment given by the devil”
3:6	fgua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κρίμα & τοῦ διαβόλου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “being judged as the devil was”
3:7	dosq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next requirement for being an overseer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next idea, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,”
3:7	s3w1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μαρτυρίαν καλὴν ἔχειν ἀπὸ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for it to be testified about him that he is good by”

3:7	si1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν ἔξωθεν	1	The phrase **the ones outside** identifies people who do not belong to the group of believers.

Alternate translation: “the outsiders” or “the people who are not part of your group”
3:7	qsa6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμπέσῃ, καὶ	1	Here Paul refers to experiencing **reproach** as if it were falling into a hole. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he may not be overcome by reproach and fall into” or “he may not experience reproach and fall into”
3:7	l2s9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμπέσῃ, καὶ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reproach**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he may not be reproached and fall into”
3:7	t245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Here Paul speaks of how **the devil** gains power or control over people as if he were trapping. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “be like an animal that the devil has trapped” or “the power of the devil” or “the control of the devil”
3:8	nz2w			διακόνους ὡσαύτως	1	Alternate translation: “Deacons, just like overseers,”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “not two-tongued” or “speaking with integrity”
3:8	d96g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ αἰσχροκερδεῖς	1	Here, the word translated as **greedy** could refer to: (1) strong desire for more money and goods than one needs.

3:9	c44a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔχοντας	1	Here, the word **having** implies that these people are faithful to and continue to believe what they are **having**.

3:9	jda1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ μυστήριον τῆς πίστεως	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **mystery** that could: (1) contain what people accept by **faith**. Alternate translation: “the mystery that is the teaching we accept in faith” (1) be what people accept by **faith**. Alternate translation: “the mystery that we believe”
3:9	rfv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ μυστήριον τῆς πίστεως	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **mystery** and **faith**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “what we believe that was once hidden” or “the hidden things that we believe”
3:9	y91f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει	1	A **conscience** that is **pure** is one that does not convict a person of doing anything wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar phrases in [1:5](../01/05.md) and [1:19](../01/19.md).

3:10	hl1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ οὗτοι & δοκιμαζέσθωσαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “let some of the believers also test them” or “let those who are already leaders also test them”
3:10	gxz0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διακονείτωσαν, ἀνέγκλητοι ὄντες	1	Here, the phrase **being blameless** could give: (1) the condition that must be fulfilled for them to **serve**.

3:12	wji2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρες	1	Paul used a very similar phrase in [3:2](../03/02.md), and you should express the idea as you did there. He could mean that **deacons**: (1) each must be sexually faith to one woman, his wife. Alternate translation: “men who are faithful to their wives” (2) each must have no more than one wife at a time. Alternate translation: “husbands of only one wife at a time” (3) each must have been married no more than once, even if the marriage ended in divorce or death.

3:12	zio6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τέκνων & καὶ τῶν ἰδίων οἴκων	1	The phrase **children and their own households** is not making a distinction between **children** and **households** by indicating that the **children** are not part of the **household**. Rather, the phrase emphasizes that the **children** are a particularly important part of the **households**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “children and the rest of their own households” or “their own households, and particularly their children,”
3:13	rfq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why deacons should be the kind of people that Paul has described in [3:8–12](../03/08.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason to keep a set of requirements, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “They should strive to be that kind of people, since” or “Here is why they should do those things:”
3:13	t259		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ & διακονήσαντες	1	Here, the phrase **the ones having served** could refer: (1) just to the deacons, whom Paul has discussed in [3:8–12](../03/08.md). Alternate translation: “the deacons who have served” (2) both to the deacons and to the overseers, whom he has discussed in [3:1–12](../03/01.md).

Alternate translation: “be able to be very confident as they believe in Christ Jesus” or “be very confident about how they believe in Christ Jesus”
3:14	qxvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	γράφω	1	Here Paul refers to the writing of this letter from his perspective, which is in the present. However, when Timothy receives the letter, the writing of this letter would be in the past. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use whatever form people would use in your language to refer to the writing of a letter. Alternate translation: “I have written”
3:14	env2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτά	1	Here, the phrase **these things** could refer to: (1) everything that Paul has included in the letter.

Usually, people in Paul’s culture did not write letters to someone if they planned to visit that person soon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that is unexpected. Alternate translation: “even though I hope” or “despite the fact that I hope”
3:14	zzzu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθεῖν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “to go”

3:15	raak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἐὰν δὲ βραδύνω	1	Here Paul is indicating that, instead of coming quickly to Timothy, he may **delay**.

3:15	z9z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βραδύνω	1	Here Paul may be implying that: (1) he himself might choose to **delay**.

3:15	wzk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	This phrase introduces further information about **the household of God**. It does not distinguish between a **household of God** that is **the church** and one that is not **the church**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces further information, not a distinction. Alternate translation: “by which I mean the church of the living God”
3:15	g0c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **the church** that worships and belongs to **the living God**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the church that worships the living God”
3:15	sg64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Here, the phrase **the living God** identifies God as the one who “lives.” The primary point is that God actually “lives,” unlike idols and other inanimate things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God”
3:15	cd5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	στῦλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Here Paul speaks as if **the truth** were the roof of a building and of the church as if it were **a pillar and support** that held up that roof.

3:15	t267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	στῦλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα	1	The terms **pillar** and **support** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis.

In order to indicate this, the ULT and UST put quote marks around these words and format them as poetry. Consider how you might indicate in your language that these words are from a confession or hymn.
3:16	m4xi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί, ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι, ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις, ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν, ἐπιστεύθη ἐν κόσμῳ, ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the actions, it is clear from the context that either God or Jesus himself did the revealing, that the **Spirit** did the justifying, that the **angels** did the seeing, that believers did the proclaiming, that people in general did the believing, and that God did the taking up. Alternate translation: “God revealed him in flesh, the Spirit justified him, angels saw him, believers proclaimed him among the nations, people in the world believed in him, God took him up in glory”
3:16	gm36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃς	1	The pronoun **Who** refers to Jesus Christ. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “The Christ”
3:16	r7hg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ὃς	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **Who**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “God.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
3:16	rqp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν σαρκί	1	Here, the word **flesh** refers to human existence in its weakness and frailty. Paul means that Jesus was human. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as a human being”
3:16	pjr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι	1	Here, the phrase **was justified** could indicate that Jesus was: (1) proved by the Holy Spirit to be who he said he was. Alternate translation: “was proven right by the Spirit” (2) declared innocent by the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “was proven guiltless by the Spirit” or “was vindicated by the Spirit”
3:16	av4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἔθνεσιν	1	Here, the word **nations** could refer to: (1) non-Jewish people. Alternate translation: “among the Gentiles” (2) all groups of people. Alternate translation: “among all people groups”
3:16	h9mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν κόσμῳ	1	Here, the phrase **in the world** indicates that people in many places throughout **the world** believed in Jesus.

4:intro	b39h				0	# 1 Timothy 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Paul gives instructions about how Timothy should behave and what he should teach (4:1–16)\n      * Condemnation of the false teachers (4:1–5)\n      * Timothy should train himself for godliness (4:6–10)\n      * How Timothy should act as a leader (4:11–16)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### False teachers\n\nIn [4:1](../04/01.md), Paul indicates that some people will stop believing in Jesus. In [4:2](../04/02.md), he indicates that “liars” will teach them what is wrong. These “liars” are false teachers that Paul wants Timothy to confront and discredit. Paul does not include very much about what these false teachers were saying, but he does say that they were telling people not to marry and to avoid certain foods ([4:3](../04/03.md)). He also implies that these false teachers use or tell stories that Paul calls “myths” ([4:7](../04/07.md)). Christians debate what ideas these false teachers were spreading. What is clear is that they were using stories that were not in the Scriptures, and they were convincing people to abstain from things that God said were good. Make sure that this is clear in your translation.\n\n### Timothy’s “gift”\n\nIn [4:14](../04/14.md), Paul speaks about the “gift” that Timothy received. When he received it, someone prophesied about it, and the elders laid their hands on Timothy to commission him. It is clear in the context that God gave this “gift,” which is a special skill or ability that Timothy had. Most likely, this skill or ability enabled Timothy to teach and lead believers well. Since Paul does not state or even imply what the “gift” was, you should use a general word or phrase that refers to a special skill or ability.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Training\n\nIn [4:7](../04/07.md), Paul instructs Timothy to “train” himself for godliness. In the following verse, he indicates that “bodily training” is helpful for a little while, but godliness is always helpful. In Timothy’s culture, education included both physical and mental training, and people often used words and ideas related to physical training to describe mental training. Paul similarly uses a word for physical training to describe the hard work required to become godly. Since this is a common metaphor in the Bible, if possible preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n\n### Which verse contains the trustworthy word?\n\nIn [4:9](../04/09.md), Paul indicates that the “word,” or statement, is **trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance**. It is not clear whether Paul is referring back to something he wrote in [4:8](../04/08.md) or whether he is referring ahead to something he will write in [4:10](../04/10.md). Because of that, the ULT makes [4:9](../04/09.md) its own sentence to preserve the ambiguity. If it is possible, you could express the idea in such a way that the “word” could be either before or after verse 9. If you choose to make the reference explicit, the UST illustrates how you might express the idea if the “word” is in verse 10. Here is how you might express the idea if the “word” is in verse 8:\n * “[8] for ‘bodily training is useful for little, but godliness is useful for all, having promise of life, now and coming.’ [9] That word is trustworthy and worthy of all acceptance. [10] For unto this we toil and struggle, because we have hoped in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.”
4:1	jzr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next topic that Paul wishes to write about. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next topic, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,”
4:1	bhj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τὸ & Πνεῦμα ῥητῶς λέγει	1	Here Paul does not indicate when or where **the Spirit says** these things. He could be referring to prophecies in the Old Testament, prophecies that were given more recently by Christian prophets, or things that the **the Spirit** was revealing to him. Since it is not clear where and when **the Spirit** speaks, if possible use a general phrase here. Alternate translation: “the Spirit has spoken specifically” or “the Spirit is indicating specifically”
4:1	b739		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς	1	Here, the phrase **later times** could refer to: (1) the last days in general, the period between Jesus’ resurrection and second coming.

4:1	jgec		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσέχοντες	1	Here, the phrase **paying attention to** could introduce: (1) a further description of what these people do.

Alternate translation: “which they will do because they pay attention to” (3) the means by which these people fall away. Alternate translation: “which they will do by paying attention to”
4:1	u1ui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πνεύμασι πλάνοις	1	Here, the phrase **deceiving spirits** refers to evil spiritual beings who deceive people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “deceptive devils” or “evil spirits who deceive”
4:1	ae5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων	1	Here Paul is using the possessive form to describe **teachings** that come from **demons**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “teachings from demons”
4:2	tkqf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων	1	Here, the word **in** could introduce: (1) the means or cause by which some people will pay attention to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons. Alternate translation: “which they will pay attention to through the hypocrisy of liars” or “because of the hypocrisy of liars” (2) the means by which they learn the teachings of demons. Alternate translation: “which are taught through the hypocrisy of liars”
4:2	pw29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hypocrisy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “through liars who act hypocritically”
4:2	u2f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	Here Paul could be speaking as if these people’s **conscience**: (1) had been **seared**, so that it can no longer feel anything. In this case, he means that they no longer feel convicted about what is right and wrong. Alternate translation: “who live as if they had been seared in their own conscience” or “no longer being convicted of what is right or wrong” (2) had been branded and thus marked either as belonging to Satan or as a sinner. Alternate translation: “who live as if they had been branded in their own conscience as belonging to Satan” or “having been marked as sinners”
4:2	t288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could indicate that: (1) they did it themselves. Alternate translation: “having seared their own consciences” (2) their hypocrisy and lies did it. Alternate translation: “their hypocrisy having seared their own consciences”
4:2	gp0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	If it would not be natural in your language to speak as if a group of people had only one **conscience**, you could use the plural form of that word in your translation. Alternate translation: “in their own consciences”
4:3	t291		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀπέχεσθαι	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He does not mean that these false teachers will forbid believers to abstain from certain foods, but that the false teachers will require them to abstain from certain foods. You could supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “requiring to abstain”
4:3	m1d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων	1	Here Paul implies that the false teachers were telling people **to abstain** from certain kinds of **foods**.

4:3	wely		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	βρωμάτων ἃ ὁ Θεὸς ἔκτισεν	1	Here Paul is further describing the **foods** from which the false teachers required people **to abstain**.

4:3	t293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ εὐχαριστίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **thanksgiving**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “thankfully”

4:4	pppf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces support for what Paul stated in the previous verse about what God made foods for.

5:intro	jx4e				0	# 1 Timothy 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n8. Paul gives instructions about how to treat different types of believers (5:1–6:2)\n      * How Timothy should treat various people in the church (5:1–2)\n      * Qualifications for real widows whom the church will support (5:3–10)\n      * Reasons for not supporting younger widows (5:11–16)\n      * How to treat elders (5:17–21)\n      * Miscellaneous instructions to Timothy (5:22–25)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The list of widows\n\nIn [5:3–16](../05/03.md), Paul gives instructions for how to honor certain widows by supporting them financially. He implies in [5:9](../05/09.md) that there was an official list on which widows could be “enrolled.” Christians debate whether widows who were enrolled on this list had official positions in the church or were required to perform certain responsibilities. It is likely that these widows were expected to do certain things, but it is unlikely that all of them had offices or positions in the church. In your translation, you should make it clear that the church had a list of widows that it supported, but it is not recommended that you include any further implied information.\n\n### “Real” widows\n\nIn [5:3](../05/03.md), [5:5](../05/05.md), and [5:16](../05/16.md), Paul refers to “real” widows. He is not distinguishing between widows whose husbands have died and “widows” whose husbands have not actually died. Rather, he is distinguishing between widows who have no family to support them (“real” widows) and widows who do have family to support them. Paul indicates that it is these “real” widows, and even more specifically the ones who meet the qualifications in [5:9–10](../05/09.md), who can be enrolled on the list of supported widows.\n\n### Qualifications for widows who are supported by the church\n\nIn [5:9–10](../05/09.md), Paul provides a list of characteristics that indicate which widows the church should support. This list is meant to be a general guideline, not a precise list of exactly every characteristic that a widow must have. For example, Paul indicates that widows must have raised children, but most Christians believe that this does not mean that supported widows must have had children. Instead, Paul is indicating that raising children is a good example of the kind of good works that these widows must have done. Consider what form you might use in your language to give a general list of qualifications.\n\n### Younger widows\n\nIn [5:11–15](../05/11.md), Paul indicates that younger widows should not be on the list of supported widows. To support this command, he gives examples of ways in which younger widows often behaved. There are at least three primary ways to understand the situation that Paul speaks about:\n\n1. These young women’s husbands have died, which leaves them poor and unable to live comfortably. Even with the support of the church, they would have to live without very much. Paul anticipates that these young women will desire to live wealthier and more luxurious lives. To do so, they would need to marry again, and Paul is concerned that they would marry any rich man, even an unbeliever. In that case, they would be abandoning their faith in Jesus so that they can have what they want. Meanwhile, they do not do anything productive but instead spend their time interfering and gossiping. Because of that, Paul wants these young widows to go ahead and get married (to fellow believers).\n2. When widows were enrolled on the list of women that the church would support, they had to promise to serve the church and never marry again. Paul anticipates that the younger widows will desire to have sex and to have husbands again. To do so, they might break their promise not to marry again. Meanwhile, they do not do anything productive but instead spend their time interfering and gossiping. Because of those things, Paul wants these widows to marry again instead of making a promise to remain widows.\n3. The term “younger widows” refers to young women who have made vows to remain single and never marry. Paul anticipates that these young women will regret their vows and desire to have sex and to have husbands. To do so, they might break those vows. Meanwhile, they do not do anything productive but instead spend their time interfering and gossiping. Because of those things, Paul does not want the church to support these young women, who should instead marry and have families.\n\nSince Paul’s descriptions are general enough to refer to any of these three situations, if possible your translation should allow for all of these possibilities, but especially the first two.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n\n### The “Scripture” in [5:18](../05/18.md)\n\nIn [5:18](../05/18.md), Paul introduces two quotations with the phrase “the Scripture says.” The first quotation is from [Deuteronomy 25:4](../deu/25/04.md). The second quotation comes from Jesus and is recorded in [Luke 10:7](../luk/10/07.md). Paul may have had a copy of the Gospel of Luke, or he may have known about this saying of Jesus from some other source. Further, Paul may have intended the word “Scripture” to refer to both quotations, in which case he would be indicating that the sayings of Jesus or perhaps even the Gospel of Luke count as Scripture. On the other hand, since the word “Scripture” is singular, Paul may have intended to identify only the first quotation as Scripture. Some translations format both quotations in the same, and other translations format them differently. Since Christians disagree about this, if possible your translation should allow for both possibilities. If you must choose one possibility, it is recommended that you identify both quotations as “Scripture.”\n\n### The coherence of [5:22-25](../05/22.md)\n\nIn [5:22–25](../05/22.md), Paul gives instructions and advice to Timothy. Christians debate whether these general instructions and pieces of advice are not closely connected or whether they are all related to which people should serve as elders and leaders in the church. For example, Paul could be talking about the sins and good works of people in general, or he could be speaking specifically about sins and good works that disqualify or qualify people to serve as elders. Since Paul speaks in general terms in these verses, if possible your translation should allow for both possibilities.
5:1	enp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς πατέρα & ὡς ἀδελφούς	1	Paul wants Timothy to **exhort** each **older man** as he would speak to his own **father**, and he wants Timothy to **exhort** **younger men** as he would speak to his own younger **brothers**.

Alternate translation: “as you would respectfully exhort your own father … as you would exhort your own brothers”
5:1	dnf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	νεωτέρους	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

5:2	qcri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς ἀδελφὰς, ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνίᾳ	1	Here, the phrase **in all purity** could describe: (1) only how Timothy should exhort **younger women**. In this case, Paul is especially concerned about sexual **purity**.

5:3	cryc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	χήρας τίμα	1	Here, the command **Honor** is singular. However, Paul probably implies that Timothy should make sure that other believers also **Honor widows**.

5:5	u1lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	προσμένει ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	Here Paul speaks as if **requests and prayers** were a location that a widow **remains in**.

5:5	rb9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	Here, the phrase **night and day** indicates that this **widow** prays during both the day and the night.

5:6	qy5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζῶσα τέθνηκεν	1	Here Paul describes widows who act like this as if they had **died** even though they are **living**. He means that they are like dead people because they are spiritually dead. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “although still living, is like someone who has died” or “living, has died spiritually”
5:7	qw6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase **these things** refers to the instructions about widows and their families in the preceding verses (see [5:4–6](../05/04.md)). Paul includes the word **also** because he earlier told Timothy to “command” other things (see [4:11](../04/11.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “what I have written about widows, too,” or “also what I have said about widows and their families”
5:7	z43h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὦσιν	1	The pronoun **they** could refer to: (1) all the believers who are with Timothy.

5:8	z3wo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἰδίων & ἤρνηται	1	Although the terms **his** and **he** are masculine, Paul is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

Alternate translation: “for his or her own … he or she has denied” or “for his or her own … that person has denied”
5:8	p7h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν ἰδίων	1	Paul is using the adjective phrase **his own** as a noun to mean someone’s extended family.

Alternate translation: “for his own extended family” or “for his own people”
5:8	sco2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἰκείων	1	Here, the phrase **household members** refers specifically to one’s close family, the family members who live together in one house.

5:8	y645		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “how he believes in Jesus”
5:8	evm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔστιν ἀπίστου χείρων	1	Here Paul implies that this person is a **worse** sinner than **an unbeliever**, since unbelievers generally do take care of their families. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “is a worse sinner than an unbeliever who does take care of his own” or “does what is wrong more than an unbeliever does”
5:9	b5jv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “A widow should be enrolled”
5:9	s8ql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be the leaders of the group of believers, including Timothy. Alternate translation: “Let the leaders enroll a widow” or “You may enroll a widow”
5:9	khe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χήρα καταλεγέσθω μὴ ἔλαττον	1	Here Paul implies that the church had a list of widows who truly needed the church to support them. In this and the following verse, Paul gives a list of qualifications for which widows could be put on this list. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make those ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “Let a widow be counted as one of the widows who truly need help, as long as she is not less than” or “Let a widow’s name be included on the list of widows whom the church will support if she is not less than”
5:9	i27x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἔλαττον	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative phrase **less than**. Alternate translation: “over”
5:9	q9dj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς γυνή	1	Paul used a very similar phrase in [3:2](../03/02.md), and you should express the idea in a similar way here. Paul could mean that the widows: (1) each must have been sexually faith to one man, her late husband. Alternate translation: “a women who was faithful to her husband” (2) each must have been married no more than once, even if the marriage ended in divorce or death. Alternate translation: “a woman who was married only once”
5:10	l8nm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν & μαρτυρουμένη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “good works such as raising children, receiving strangers, washing the feet of the saints, relieving the afflicted, pursuing every good work” (2) separate requirements for being enrolled as a widow in need of support. Alternate translation: “good works. Let her be enrolled if she has raised children, if she has received strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has aided the afflicted, if she has followed every good work”
5:10	mik7			ἐξενοδόχησεν	1	Alternate translations: “she has welcomed strangers into her home” or “she has practiced hospitality”
5:10	ygl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	In this culture, people walked barefoot or in sandals on roads that were dusty or muddy. When they arrived at a house, usually they or a servant would wash their feet to clean off the dust or mud. Washing off someone’s feet was generally considered a menial or lowly task. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of practice, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general phrase. Alternate translation: “she has helped the saints take off their shoes when they went inside” or “she has cared for the saints who visited her”
5:10	t366		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	Here Paul may be referring to washing feet in order to: (1) give another specific example of the **good works** that this widow has done. Alternate translation: “she has cleaned the saints’ feet” (2) describe more generally any kind of humble service. Alternate translation: “has done humble things to help the saints” or “she has performed menial tasks for the saints”
5:10	ey6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	θλιβομένοις	1	Paul is using the adjective **afflicted** as a noun to mean people who are afflicted.

5:10	leru		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπηκολούθησεν	1	Here, Paul speaks as if **every good work** were a person whom this widow **followed**. He means that she has worked hard always to do **every good work**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “she has been eager to perform” or “she has strived to do”
5:10	h96j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ	1	Paul says **every** here as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “every kind of good work” or “very many good works”
5:11	rv5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νεωτέρας & χήρας παραιτοῦ	1	Here Paul implies that Timothy should **refuse** to enroll the **younger widows** on the list of widows whom the church would support (see [5:9](../05/09.md)).

Alternate translation: “refuse to enroll younger widows” or “refuse to include younger widows on the list of widows whom the church will support”
5:11	vqq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καταστρηνιάσωσιν τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **indulge themselves against Christ** could mean that these widows: (1) desire to live self-indulgently in contrast to obeying Christ. Alternate translation: “they desire to live self-indulgently instead of obeying Christ” or “they want to indulge themselves” (2) desiring to have sex in contrast to serving Christ as widows. Alternate translation: “they have sexual desires that overcome their loyalty to Christ” or “their sexual desires turn them away from Christ”
5:11	dm0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γαμεῖν θέλουσιν	1	Since in [5:14](../05/14.md) Paul recommends that these widows marry again, here he must have a specific situation in mind where wanting **to marry** is wrong. He could be implying that these widows **want to marry**: (1) anyone who has money and can support their self-indulgent lifestyles, even if that person is an unbeliever. Alternate translation: “they want to marry anyone who can support their self-indulgent desires” or “they want to marry even unbelievers so they can live as they desire” (2) after they have promised to serve in the church as widows without marrying again. Alternate translation: “they want to marry even though they have promised to remain widows” or “they want to marry despite their pledge to serve as widows”
5:12	gtli		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχουσαι κρίμα ὅτι τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

5:12	nha7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν πρώτην πίστιν	1	Here, the word **faith** could refer to: (1) the **faith** that the younger widows had in Jesus. In this case, they **have annulled** this faith by marrying anyone, even an unbeliever, so that they can indulge their selfish desires. Alternate translation: “the first faith that they had in Christ” (2) a commitment that the widows made that they would remain as widows and serve the Christian community for the rest of their lives. In this case, they **have annulled** this commitment by choosing to marry when they said that they would not marry. Alternate translations: “their first commitment to remain single” or “what they first promised to do”
5:12	aaoz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν πρώτην πίστιν	1	Here, the word **first** refers to **faith** that the widows had before they wanted to get married. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “the earlier faith” or “the faith that they had earlier”

5:13	vclq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that Paul wants to write. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next idea, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,”
5:13	t4iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καὶ & μανθάνουσιν	1	Here, **learn** represents experiencing something by doing it repeatedly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar idea in [5:4](../05/04.md). Alternate translation: “they are also consistently” or “they figure out how to be”
5:13	t376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περιερχόμεναι τὰς οἰκίας	1	Here Paul implies that these young widows may visit one house after another. The rest of the verse implies that they would do this in order to gossip and learn what other people were doing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “going from house to house”
5:13	nll4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	φλύαροι καὶ περίεργοι, λαλοῦσαι τὰ μὴ δέοντα	1	These two terms and a phrase mean similar things. The word **babblers** refers to people who say many things that do not mean very much. The word **meddlers** refers to people who try to figure out what others are doing and interfere in it. The phrase **saying what they should not** refers to speaking about things that should not be spoken about. Paul is using these three terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with two phrases or one general statement. Alternate translation: “meddling and saying what they should not” or “meddling by their gossip”
5:14	te2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νεωτέρας	1	Here Paul is referring to the **younger** widows whom he has been speaking about in [5:11–13](../05/11.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “those younger widows”

Alternate translation: “do nothing that would allow the one opposing to revile”
5:14	z79q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λοιδορίας χάριν	1	Here, the **reviling** could be directed toward: (1) believers in general. Alternate translation: “for reviling us” (2) just the widows. Alternate translation: “for reviling them”
5:14	u94k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ ἀντικειμένῳ	1	Here, the phrase **the one opposing** could refer to: (1) Satan. In this case, Satan probably would use other people to revile believers. Alternate translation: “to the devil” (2) any person who opposes or attacks believers. Alternate translation: “to people who oppose us” or “to enemies of the believers”
5:15	cb8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul has given the instructions in the previous verses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for instructions, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Here is why I have included those instructions:”
5:15	fy54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξετράπησαν ὀπίσω τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Here Paul speaks of abandoning what God wants believers to do and instead focusing on what Satan wants them to do as if they were turning away **after Satan**. He means that these people have stopped doing what God wants and are instead doing what **Satan** wants. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “have deviated from obeying God to obeying Satan” or “have started to obey Satan instead of God”
5:16	ysth		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	πιστὴ	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **believing woman**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “believing man or woman.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
5:16	mf4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔχει χήρας	1	The implication is that she **has widows** within her extended family. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “has relatives who are widows”
5:16	a6vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ἐπαρκείτω	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “she must aid”
5:16	ptc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **and** introduces what the intended result is when believing women aid the widows in their own families.

5:16	t384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say what would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be supporting widows who have family members who could support them instead. Alternate translation: “let supporting those widows not weigh down the church”
5:16	tooq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the church must not be weighed down”
5:16	d35m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῖς ὄντως χήραις	1	Here Paul again defines the kind of widow to which he is particularly referring. As in [5:3](../05/03.md), the word **real** indicates that these women are not only widows but also have no close relatives to support them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the widows who have no one else to provide for them” or “the widows with no family left”
5:17	j2y5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι & ἀξιούσθωσαν	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language.

5:17	u93q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι & ἀξιούσθωσαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be the believers whom these **elders** have **led**. Alternate translation: “The believers should consider the elders having led them well to be worthy”
5:17	m5ou			προεστῶτες	1	Alternate translations: “having managed” or “having taken care”
5:17	oxzr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διπλῆς τιμῆς	1	Here, the phrase **double honor** could refer to: (1) two different kinds of **honor**, respect and payment. Alternate translation: “of both honor and payment” (2) a large amount of **honor**. Alternate translation: “of much honor” (3) **double** the **honor** or payment given to other people whom the church supported. Alternate translation: “of double the honor given to others” or “of double the payment that is given to others”
5:17	wp9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διπλῆς τιμῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **honor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “of being honored in both ways” or “of being both honored and paid”
5:17	t390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Here, **word** represents what these **elders** preach using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “preaching”
5:18	jmqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a support for the command that Paul gave in the previous verse.

Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Here is why:”
5:18	zkq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγει & ἡ Γραφή, βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις, καί, ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul quotes from the Old Testament Scriptures, specifically from [Deuteronomy 25:4](../deu/25/04.md). Then he quotes something that Jesus said, which can be found in [Luke 10:7](../luk/10/7.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could format these words in a different way and include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the Scripture says in Deuteronomy, ‘You will not muzzle an ox threshing,’ and in the Gospel of Luke, ‘The worker is worthy of his wages’”
5:18	kh55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	λέγει & ἡ Γραφή	1	Here, Paul speaks of **the Scripture** as if it were a person who could say something. He means that these words can be read in **the Scripture**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you can read in the Scripture” or “it is written in the Scripture”
5:18	t392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	οὐ φιμώσεις	1	The author of the quotation is using the future form to give a command.

5:18	vw3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις, καί	1	When he quotes this passage, Paul is implying that the leaders of the church are like an **ox** that is **threshing**. Both are doing work, and both deserve to be supported as they do that work. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the comparison between the **ox** and the church leaders more explicit. Alternate translation: “‘You will not muzzle an ox threshing,’ and this applies to the elders as well, who should be supported for the work they do. Also,”
5:18	g985		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	In Paul’s culture, farmers often would make oxen thresh, that is, walk on harvested wheat to separate the kernels of grain from the wheat stalks. Some people would **muzzle an ox** while it was **threshing** in order to keep the ox from eating the grain. The point of the command is that the **ox** should be allowed to eat what it is working to produce: the grain. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of farming practice, you could give more information about what the **ox** is doing, or you could use a more general description. Alternate translation: “You will not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating the grain it is threshing” or “You will not prevent an animal from eating while it is working to produce food”
5:18	kys1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἄξιος & τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe someone who is **worthy** to receive **his wages**.

5:19	ebrf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ πρεσβυτέρου κατηγορίαν μὴ παραδέχου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **accusation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “When someone accuses an elder, do not receive it”
5:19	af68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	κατηγορίαν μὴ παραδέχου, ἐκτὸς εἰ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “receive an accusation only if”
5:19	t399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐκτὸς εἰ μὴ ἐπὶ	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “unless it is based on the testimony of”
5:19	kmy5			δύο ἢ τριῶν	1	Alternate translations: “two or more”
5:20	d9l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς ἁμαρτάνοντας	1	Here, the phrase **The ones sinning** could refer to: (1) elders who have sinned. Alternate translation: “The elders who are sinning” (2) believers who have sinned. Alternate translation: “Believers who are sinning”
5:20	db63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντων	1	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun to mean all the believers. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Paul could be referring to **the rest** of: (1) the elders. Alternate translation: “the rest of the elders” (2) the believers. Alternate translation: “the rest of the believers”
5:20	ql4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φόβον ἔχωσιν	1	Here Paul implies that these people will **have fear** of sinning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “may have fear of themselves sinning”

5:21	t7jq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “the angels God has chosen”
5:21	t409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase **these things** refers to the instructions that Paul has given to Timothy about how to treat elders (see [5:17–20](../05/17.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “those rules about elders”
5:21	t408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	χωρὶς προκρίματος, μηδὲν ποιῶν κατὰ πρόσκλισιν	1	The terms **prejudgment** and **partiality** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “in a way that is completely fair to everyone”
5:21	dph6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χωρὶς προκρίματος, μηδὲν ποιῶν κατὰ πρόσκλισιν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **prejudgment** and **partiality**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

Alternate translation: “Place hands on no one hastily to commission him” or “Authorize no one by placing hands on him hastily”
5:22	pyl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲ κοινώνει ἁμαρτίαις ἀλλοτρίαις	1	Here, Paul implies that Timothy might **share in the sins of others** if he helps to appoint leaders who are sinning or if he does not confront leaders who are sinning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “nor participate in the sins of others by appointing and affirming them as leaders” or “nor join in with or affirm others who are sinning”
5:23	xl32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἴνῳ ὀλίγῳ χρῶ	1	Here Paul means that Timothy should have **a little wine** in addition to the water he was drinking. In Paul’s culture, people believed that wine could help with certain physical problems and illnesses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “also use a little wine as medicine”
5:23	gl5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	διὰ τὸν στόμαχον καὶ τὰς πυκνάς σου ἀσθενείας	1	Paul does not imply what kind of **stomach** problems and **illnesses** Timothy was experiencing. However, it is clear that Paul thought that **a little wine** would help with these problems. Since Paul does not state what kind of health problems Timothy was having, you should use general terms for stomach problems and sicknesses. Alternate translation: “because of your digestion problems and your frequent sicknesses”
5:24	uk56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τινῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

He means that everyone knows that some people are guilty before they experience **judgment**, but with other people no one knows that they are guilty before they experience **judgment**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

5:24	qa9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς κρίσιν	1	Here, the word **judgment** could refer to: (1) how God will judge everyone when Jesus comes back. Alternate translation: “into the final judgment” or “God’s judgment” (2) how the church or its leaders will judge people who are sinning. Alternate translation: “into the church’s judgment” or “into the judgment of the church leaders”

5:25	pd8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τὰ ἔργα τὰ καλὰ πρόδηλα	1	Here Paul implies that these are **the good works** of some people, since he states in the second half of the verse that some good works are not evident. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “also the good works of some are evident”
5:25	bl51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ἄλλως ἔχοντα	1	Here Paul is referring to good works that are **otherwise** because they are not immediately **evident**.

6:intro	rks4				0	# 1 Timothy 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n8. Paul gives instructions about how to treat different types of believers (5:1–6:2)\n      * How slaves should treat their masters (6:1–2)\n9. Paul condemns false teachers and lovers of money (6:3–10)\n10. Paul encourages Timothy (6:11–16)\n11. Paul gives commands for rich people (6:17–19)\n12. Final exhortation and letter closing (6:20–21)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Slavery\n\nIn [6:1–2](../06/01.md), Paul teaches Christian slaves to honor and serve their masters. This does not mean that he is endorsing slavery as a good thing or as something that God approves of. Instead, Paul is encouraging believers to be godly and content in every situation that they are in. This does not mean that they cannot also work to change those situations. Be sure that your translation does not imply that Paul is encouraging people to have slaves.\n\n### Wealth and money\n\nIn [6:5–10](../06/05.md), Paul condemns some people for thinking that godliness is a means of gain, and he instead indicates that godliness with contentment is the real gain. Then Paul explains that loving money causes many kinds of evil desires and behavior. Later on, in [6:17–19](../06/17.md), he indicates that people who are rich should focus on gaining blessings from Jesus when he returns. To do that, they should give away and share their money and possessions. So, throughout this chapter, Paul indicates that being rich and desiring to be rich are dangerous. Paul does not mean that no rich people can be believers, but he does mean that rich people must do good things, including giving and sharing what they have. Make sure that your translation expresses that idea.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Fighting the good fight\n\nIn [6:12](../06/12.md), Paul exhorts Timothy to “fight the good fight of the faith.” He compares how Timothy must act in faith to how soldiers fight in a war. He implies that Timothy will experience conflict, danger, and hardship and that he must obey God and Paul as a soldier obeys his commanders. Since Paul uses warfare language to refer to the Christian life in many verses, if possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on this verse for translation options, and see how you expressed the similar idea in [1:18](../01/18.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:1	nm4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑπὸ ζυγὸν δοῦλοι	1	Here Paul speaks of people who work as **slaves** as though they were working animals with a **yoke** around their necks.

Alternate translation: “slaves under strict masters”
6:1	ep1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	ἡγείσθωσαν	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they must consider”

6:1	pvyp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πάσης τιμῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **honor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “of being honored always”
6:1	he2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ ἡ διδασκαλία βλασφημῆται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be unbelievers. Alternate translation: “unbelievers may not blaspheme the name of God and the teaching”
6:1	xb92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **name** represents a person, especially that person’s reputation and nature.

6:2	t2v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a command that is related to what Paul said in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a related command, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “More specifically,”
6:2	zm0i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	μὴ καταφρονείτωσαν, ὅτι ἀδελφοί εἰσιν	1	Here, the word translated as **because** could introduce: (1) the reason why slaves might **despise** their believing masters.

Alternate translation: “because they are brothers, let them not despite them”
6:2	ujcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p	μὴ καταφρονείτωσαν & δουλευέτωσαν	1	If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you could state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they must not despise them … they must serve them”
6:2	u4vv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “believers”
6:2	fvv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

6:2	jspi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μᾶλλον δουλευέτωσαν	1	Here, the word translated **rather** could: (1) introduce what the slaves should do instead of despising their masters.

6:2	tum0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ τῆς εὐεργεσίας ἀντιλαμβανόμενοι	1	Here Paul could be indicating that: (1) the masters receive **benefaction** from the slaves. Since **benefaction** was usually something that someone with money and resources gave to someone without those things, Paul is indicating that believing slaves can actually function as benefactors for their believing masters. Alternate translation: “the ones for whom their slaves function as benefactors” or “the ones for whom their slaves do good” (2) the masters give **benefaction** to their slaves.

Alternate translation: “those whom believers love” or “those whom the slaves love”
6:2	rda3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase **these things** refers back to the instructions that Paul has given to Timothy. These instructions could be the ones in [6:1–2](../06/01.md), [5:3–6:2](../05/03.md), or even the whole letter so far. Since Paul used a general phrase, if possible you should use a general phrase that could refer to any of these sections. Alternate translation: “what I have said to you” or “these instructions”
6:3	b8np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ	1	Paul speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it is true.

6:4	g2ht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τετύφωται	1	Although the term **he** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.
