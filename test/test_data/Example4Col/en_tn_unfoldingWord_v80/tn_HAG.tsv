He permitted peoples whom the Babylonians had exiled to return to their homelands. So the next year, a group of Israelites from the former kingdom of Judah returned home from exile. Within two years, they began to repair Yahweh’s temple in Jerusalem. But after they had only laid the foundation, their enemies forced them to stop. However, around 520 B.C. a new king, Darius, became emperor of Persia, and he was likely to allow the Judeans to finish rebuilding the temple. Nevertheless, they neglected that work and built luxurious homes for themselves instead. In response, Yahweh prevented their crops from growing well, and the people became hungry and poor. Yahweh then sent the prophet Haggai to explain to them that he had done this because they had neglected his temple. Through Haggai, Yahweh promised that if they would rebuild his temple, he would bless them once again with abundant crops. Yahweh also promised their governor, Zerubbabel, that he would make him an honored leader among the nations of the world. The people responded to Haggai’s prophesies by obeying Yahweh and rebuilding his temple, and Yahweh blessed them once again.\n\n### Outline of Haggai\n\nThe book of Haggai consists of four oracles that Yahweh gave him to deliver to the Judeans who had returned from exile. Each oracle is dated on a particular day of a specific month in the second year of the reign of Darius as emperor of Persia.\n\n- First oracle (1:1–15a): The people must finish the temple so that Yahweh will bless them again\n- Second oracle (1:15b–2:9): The rebuilt temple will be more glorious than the first temple\n- Third oracle (2:10–19): Yahweh has withheld crops, but now he will bless the people\n- Fourth oracle (2:20–23): Yahweh will defeat the nations and establish Zerubbabel as his honored ruler \n\n### Who was the prophet Haggai?\n\nThe book of Haggai does not tell us very much about the prophet whose oracles it records. Haggai is mentioned briefly in one other book of the Bible. Ezra 5:1 tells us that Haggai “prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and in Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.” Ezra 6:14 adds that “the elders of the Jews were building and prospering by the prophesying of Haggai the prophet” and that “they built and completed” the temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem. But we know nothing beyond this. Still, we can recognize that Haggai must have been a man of faith, courage, and conviction to challenge the Judeans in their comfortable complacency and inspire them to renew the work of rebuilding the temple.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has been titled “Haggai” or “The Book of Haggai.” Translators may also decide to give it a title such as “The Prophecies of Haggai” or “The Sayings of Haggai”\n\n## Part 2: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Hebrew months\n\nThe book of Haggai dates each of its four oracles by the day of a Hebrew month. In your translation, you could convert these Hebrew days and months into approximate dates on the calendar that your culture uses. Notes will give equivalents on Western calendars for those who wish to do this. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will often not be accurate. So it may be preferable to state the number of the day and the name of the month of the Hebrew calendar in the text of your translation and say in a footnote approximately what time of year that is on your calendar.\n\n### Quote marks\n\nThe oracles of Haggai are direct first-level quotations from Yahweh. They contain second-level and third-level quotations. If you decide to present those as direct quotations, you can indicate their beginnings and endings with second-level and third-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off these quotations. Alternatively, if your language would not put direct quotations inside a direct quotation, you could represent the second-level and third-level quotations as indirect quotations. Notes suggest how you could do this in various places.\n\n### “The declaration of Yahweh”\n\nHaggai frequently uses the formula “the declaration of Yahweh” to identify his oracles as words that Yahweh has given him to speak. If your language would not use an abstract noun such as “declaration,” you could express the same idea in another way. You might say, for example, “this is what Yahweh declares.”\n\n### “House” meaning “temple”\n\nThroughout the book of Haggai, various speakers use the word “house” to mean “temple.” They are speaking of the temple as if it would be a house in which God lived, since God’s presence would be there. If it would be helpful to your readers, in your translation you could state the meaning plainly and say “temple” rather than “house” in each of these instances.\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nThroughout the book, the words “you,” “yourselves,” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperatives are all plural because Yahweh is addressing the returned exiles as a group. The only exception is in the last verse, where “you” is singular because Yahweh is speaking to Zerubbabel alone. So if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use plural forms throughout your translation except in the last verse, where the singular form is appropriate.\n\n### The date formula of the second oracle\n\nIn 1:1 and 2:10, the first and third oracles in the book are dated with a day, month, and year. It may therefore be that the reference to a year in 1:19, “in the second year of Darius the king,” is actually part of the dating of the second oracle, which follows immediately afterwards in the text, although after a chapter and verse division. Some versions begin a new sentence with that phrase in order to put the information about the “second year” with the information in 2:1 about the “seventh month” and the “twenty-first day.” Some versions also put a section heading before “In the second year” to suggest that a new oracle is starting with that phrase. Other versions place the chapter and verse division before “In the second year of Darius the king, which makes that phrase part of 2:1. (The chapter and verse divisions in the Bible were added many centuries after the Bible was written, as an aid to locating passages within the Bible. Subsequently, some translators and publishers have made various adjustments to the placement of chapter and verse divisions.) In your translation, present the material in the way that you feel will be most helpful to your readers. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure.)\n
1:intro	n84r				1	# Haggai 1 General Notes\n\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n\nThis chapter contains the first oracle that Haggai delivered from Yahweh to the Judeans who had returned from exile.\n\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verses 4, 6, and 8–11.\r

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Haggai the prophet brought the word of Yahweh”
1:1	ria7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דְבַר־יְהוָ֜ה	1	The term **word** represents a message that Yahweh conveyed by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a message from Yahweh”

Alternate translation: “Yahweh of hosts is concerned that these people are saying that the time has not come to rebuild the house of Yahweh”
1:2	nnof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יְהוָ֥ה צְבָא֖וֹת	1	The phrase **Yahweh of Armies** is a title for God that indicates his great power. It describes him as the commander of heavenly armies. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, it may have a particular way of translating this phrase, and you may wish to use that in your translation. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to express the meaning of this phrase in some other way, here and throughout the book. Alternate translation: “Yahweh the Almighty”
1:2	cav8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֤ם הַ⁠זֶּה֙	1	The phrase **This people** refers to the people of Judah who had returned from exile in Babylon. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “These returned Judean exiles”
1:2	ck31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עֶת־בֵּ֥ית יְהוָ֖ה	1	As the General Introduction to Haggai discusses, here and often throughout the book of Haggai, the word **house** means “temple.” The people are speaking of the temple as if it would be a house in which God lived, since God’s presence would be there. Alternate translation: “the temple of Yahweh”
1:3	xs12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ דְּבַר־יְהוָ֔ה בְּ⁠יַד־חַגַּ֥י הַ⁠נָּבִ֖יא	1	 See how you translated this in [1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: “Then Haggai the prophet brought this message from Yahweh”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Now is not a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house is desolate!”
1:4	av7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לָ⁠כֶם֙ אַתֶּ֔ם & בְּ⁠בָתֵּי⁠כֶ֣ם	1	As the General Introduction to Haggai discusses, here and throughout the book except for in the last verse, the words **you**, **yourselves**, and **your** are plural because Yahweh is addressing the returned exiles, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:4	uga1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	סְפוּנִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The term **paneled** could describe: (1) houses whose walls are covered with panels of costly wood. Alternate translation: “in houses whose walls you have paneled with costly wood” (2) houses that have roofs. Alternate translation: “in your houses that have roofs”
1:5	xmjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠עַתָּ֕ה כֹּ֥ה אָמַ֖ר יְהוָ֣ה צְבָא֑וֹת שִׂ֥ימוּ לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֖ם עַל־דַּרְכֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “So now Yahweh of Armies is telling you to set your heart upon your ways”
1:5	i8x9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שִׂ֥ימוּ לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֖ם עַל־דַּרְכֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Focus your thoughts on your ways” or “Consider your ways carefully”
1:5	axkh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Since Yahweh is speaking to many people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: “your hearts”
1:5	jnk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דַּרְכֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Yahweh is speaking of how the returned exiles have been living as if that were a series of **ways** or paths that they were walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “how you have been living”
1:6	zecd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠אֵין־לְ⁠שָׂבְעָה֙	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **satiety**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “but not enough to satisfy your hunger”
1:6	rma3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵין־לְ⁠שָׁכְרָ֔ה	1	In this culture, as in many cultures today, the water was not safe to drink, so people drank wine made from grapes. This wine contained a low level of alcohol. Yahweh is emphasizing that the people do not have enough to drink to satisfy their  thirst. If they did, they would also experience a slight stimulating sensation. Yahweh is not suggesting that drunkenness is a good thing. It may be helpful to clarify the intended meaning of this statement. Alternate translation: “but you cannot drink enough to satisfy your thirst”
1:6	ep2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לָב֖וֹשׁ וְ⁠אֵין־לְ⁠חֹ֣ם ל֑⁠וֹ	1	Since to this point Yahweh has been speaking to the Judeans in the second person, it may be natural in your language to translate this sentence in the second person as well. Alternate translation: “You wear clothes, but you are not able to warm yourselves”
1:6	wiii		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠מִּשְׂתַּכֵּ֔ר מִשְׂתַּכֵּ֖ר אֶל־צְר֥וֹר נָקֽוּב	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And the wage earner earns wages, only to put them into a punctured bag”
1:6	aw8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠מִּשְׂתַּכֵּ֔ר מִשְׂתַּכֵּ֖ר אֶל־צְר֥וֹר נָקֽוּב	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the returned exiles were literally putting their **wages** in a **punctured bag**. The image suggests that when they have expenses, they do not have money available to meet them.  If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the money you earn seems to disappear quickly”
1:6	frez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	צְר֥וֹר נָקֽוּב	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “Yahweh of Armies is telling you to set your heart upon your ways”
1:7	u8ra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שִׂ֥ימוּ לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֖ם עַל־דַּרְכֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	 See how you translated this in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: “Focus your thoughts on how you have been living” or “Consider carefully how you have been living”
1:8	nk2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	עֲל֥וּ הָ⁠הָ֛ר וַ⁠הֲבֵאתֶ֥ם עֵ֖ץ וּ⁠בְנ֣וּ הַ⁠בָּ֑יִת וְ⁠אֶרְצֶה־בּ֥⁠וֹ ו⁠אכבד אָמַ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Yes, Yahweh is telling you to go up to the mountain and bring timber and build the house, and he will take pleasure in it and he will be glorified”
1:8	g039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הָ⁠הָ֛ר	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **mountain**. He means the various mountains around the city of Jerusalem, where his temple was located. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “to the mountains”
1:8	uu95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ו⁠אכבד	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of the concept of God being **glorified**. Alternate translation: “and this will glorify me” or “and in this way you will honor me”
1:9	repd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	פָּנֹ֤ה אֶל־הַרְבֵּה֙ וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה לִ⁠מְעָ֔ט וַ⁠הֲבֵאתֶ֥ם הַ⁠בַּ֖יִת וְ⁠נָפַ֣חְתִּי ב֑⁠וֹ יַ֣עַן מֶ֗ה נְאֻם֙ יְהוָ֣ה צְבָא֔וֹת יַ֗עַן בֵּיתִ⁠י֙ אֲשֶׁר־ה֣וּא חָרֵ֔ב וְ⁠אַתֶּ֥ם רָצִ֖ים אִ֥ישׁ לְ⁠בֵיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You looked for much, but behold, little! And you brought it home, but he blew upon it! And Yahweh of Armies wants you to know why this happened. It is because of his house, that it is desolate, but you are running, a man to his house”
1:9	yx8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה	1	Yahweh is using the term **behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation.
1:9	i3ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה לִ⁠מְעָ֔ט	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but you found only a little”
1:9	eb3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נָפַ֣חְתִּי ב֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he had literally blown on the crops that the Judeans brought home. The image is of the wind blowing hard and carrying off grain. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but it was as if the wind carried it away”
1:9	wsac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	יַ֣עַן מֶ֗ה & יַ֗עַן בֵּיתִ⁠י֙	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is an important reason for this! … It is because of my house”
1:9	g652		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	נְאֻם֙ יְהוָ֣ה צְבָא֔וֹת	1	As the General Introduction to Haggai discusses, if your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **declaration**, you could express the same idea in another way, here and in the other occurrences of this phrase throughout the book. Alternate translation: “this is what Yahweh of Armies declares”
1:9	l8h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֥ם רָצִ֖ים אִ֥ישׁ לְ⁠בֵיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Yahweh is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. In this context, it means “each one of you.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that indicates this. Alternate translation: “each one of you is running to his or her own house”
1:9	vl6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֥ם רָצִ֖ים אִ֥ישׁ לְ⁠בֵיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the Judeans were literally **running** back to their homes whenever they had the opportunity to return to them. He means that they are eager to improve their own homes, even though they do not care about the temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “while you are eager to improve your own homes”
1:10	suc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	כָּלְא֥וּ שָמַ֖יִם מִ⁠טָּ֑ל וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ כָּלְאָ֥ה יְבוּלָֽ⁠הּ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **heavens** and the **earth** were living things that could actively withhold **dew** and **produce** from the Judeans. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “there is no dew from the heavens above you and there is no produce from the earth”
1:10	zjm1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֔ם כָּלְא֥וּ שָמַ֖יִם מִ⁠טָּ֑ל	1	Yahweh is speaking as if **dew** fell from the **heavens**, that is, from the sky. He means implicitly that not only has rain not been falling from the sky, dew has not even been forming on the ground overnight. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “not only has it not been raining, dew has not even been forming,”
1:11	a7ds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	עַל־הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ וְ⁠עַל־הֶ⁠הָרִ֗ים וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠דָּגָן֙ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠תִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠יִּצְהָ֔ר וְ⁠עַ֛ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר תּוֹצִ֖יא הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֑ה וְ⁠עַל־הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה וְ⁠עַ֖ל כָּל־יְגִ֥יעַ כַּפָּֽיִם	1	In this verse, Yahweh uses a series of repetitive phrases to show that the effects of the **desolation** he has **called for** are comprehensive. A series of phrases like this is called a litany. If your readers would not be familiar with this form, to help them appreciate it, you could put each of the phrases on a separate line in your translation, for example:\n“And I have called for desolation\nupon the land \nand upon the mountains \nand upon the grain \nand upon the new wine …”\n
1:11	v496		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וָ⁠אֶקְרָ֨א חֹ֜רֶב עַל־הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ וְ⁠עַל־הֶ⁠הָרִ֗ים וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠דָּגָן֙ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠תִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠יִּצְהָ֔ר וְ⁠עַ֛ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר תּוֹצִ֖יא הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֑ה וְ⁠עַל־הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה וְ⁠עַ֖ל כָּל־יְגִ֥יעַ כַּפָּֽיִם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **desolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. The word “desolation” is the noun form of the word whose adjective form “desolate” Yahweh uses in verses 4 and 9. Yahweh is saying that the land of Judah is experiencing desolation because the people have left his temple desolate. So if you would not use the abstract noun “desolation” in your language, an adjective such as “desolate” may be suitable here. Alternate translation: “And I have called for the land and the mountains and the grain and the new wine and the oil and what the ground produces and the man and the beast and all the labor of your hands to become desolate”
1:11	xrhu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וָ⁠אֶקְרָ֨א	1	If you have been translating this chapter so that there are not quotations within a quotation, for consistency you would say here, “And he has called for.”
1:11	v7pk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠דָּגָן֙ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠תִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠יִּצְהָ֔ר	1	Here, **grain**, **new wine**, and **oil** represent wheat and barley, grapes, and olives, of which they are the products. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and upon the wheat and barley and upon the grapes and upon the olives”
1:11	qur8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ⁠עַל־הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙ וְ⁠עַל־הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **man** or to a specific **beast**. He means people and animals in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “and upon people and upon animals”
1:11	zygf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כַּפָּֽיִם	1	Yahweh is using one part of the Judeans, their **hands**, to mean all of them in the act of working. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everything that you do”
1:12	c4he		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֣ע & בְּ⁠קוֹל֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וְ⁠עַל־דִּבְרֵי֙ חַגַּ֣י הַ⁠נָּבִ֔יא	1	Here the word **listened** implicitly means “obeyed.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Then … obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God and the words of Haggai the prophet”
1:12	bl1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֣ע & בְּ⁠קוֹל֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וְ⁠עַל־דִּבְרֵי֙ חַגַּ֣י הַ⁠נָּבִ֔יא	1	Here the term **voice** represents what Yahweh said by using his voice and the term **words** represents what Haggai said by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Then … obeyed what Yahweh their God and Haggai the prophet had said” 
1:12	y6v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	בְּ⁠קוֹל֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וְ⁠עַל־דִּבְרֵי֙ חַגַּ֣י הַ⁠נָּבִ֔יא	1	Here a single idea is expressed through two phrases connected with **and**. The second phrase tells by what means the action of the first phrase was accomplished.

2:intro	ieh7				1	# Haggai 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter contains the second (2:1–9), third (2:10–19), and fourth (2:20–23) oracles that Haggai delivered from Yahweh to the Judeans who had returned from exile.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verses 6–7 and 21–22.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### The teaching example of uncleanness (verses 12–14)\n\nIn the third oracle, Yahweh has Haggai speak with the priests in front of the people in order to teach the people by using an example. Haggai has the priests confirm that a person in a state of holiness does not communicate that holy state to foods that he touches. Haggai then has the priests confirm that a person in a state of uncleanness does communicate that unclean state to foods that he touches. Haggai then tells the people that Yahweh considers them to be unclean, meaning not in a proper state to take part in worship, because they have not obeyed him and rebuilt the temple. They have communicated that unclean state to the foods that they have offered in sacrifice, and so those sacrifices are not acceptable to Yahweh. Stated plainly, the message of this example is that the sacrifices the people are offering on the altar do not make up for their disobedience in not rebuilding the temple. Rather, their disobedience in not rebuilding the temple is making their sacrifices unacceptable. Notes to verses 11–14 will suggest ways in which you can indicate this meaning in your translation.\n

The phrase means the same thing as the term “remnant” in [1:12](../01/12.md) and [1:14](../01/14.md). However, the phrase “the people of the land” often has a different meaning elsewhere in the Bible. In other passages, it refers to the Canaanites who were living in the region before the Israelites arrived. So it may be helpful to your readers to state the plainly what “the people of the land” means here. Alternate translation: “all you Judeans who have returned from exile”

See, for example, [Exodus 29:45–46](../exo/29/45.md), “And I will live among the sons of Israel and will be their God. And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them out from the land of Egypt to live among them.” You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.

The first phrase may mean “after only one more period of time.” The second phrase says basically the same thing but adds the information that this will be a brief period of time. Yahweh may be using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “I can assure you that after only a short time, I will be shaking”
2:6	e2qq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י מַרְעִישׁ֙	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he would literally be **shaking** all of creation. The image is that of a great earthquake. (People in this culture considered the sky to be a solid object above the earth, so Yahweh could shake that as well as the earth with a great quake.) It becomes clear in the next verse that Yahweh is actually using all of creation to represent “all nations” in their relationship to his chosen people. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will bring about such changes in the attitude of the nations toward you that it will be as if I am shaking”

He is then using the two main components of creation below the sky, the **sea** and the **dry land**, to mean the entire world in which humans live. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “everything that I have created”

It is clear from the context that this represents Yahweh changing the attitude of the nations. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And I will change the attitude of all the nations toward you”
2:7	kpek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠מִלֵּאתִ֞י אֶת־הַ⁠בַּ֤יִת הַ⁠זֶּה֙ כָּב֔וֹד	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the same idea in another way. In this context, the word **glory** could mean: (1) the **treasure** that the **nations** will bring to the temple as an offering to Yahweh. The next verse suggests that this may be the meaning. Alternate translation: “and I will fill this temple with glorious treasure” (2) the reputation that the temple would have. Alternate translation: “and I will give this temple a glorious reputation”

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a person who has become unclean by touching a dead body” 
2:13	nky1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	טְמֵא־נֶ֛פֶשׁ	1	Haggai and the priests share the knowledge that if an Israelite touches a dead body, something that is ritually unclean, then that Israelite becomes ritually unclean himself for a certain period of time (see [Numbers 19:13](../Num/19/13.md)). Such a person is not allowed to take part in public worship. It may be helpful to state this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “someone who has become ritually impure by contact with a dead body” or “someone who is unable to join in public worship because he has touched a dead body”
2:13	o2ew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠כָל־אֵ֖לֶּה הֲ⁠יִטְמָ֑א	1	The pronoun **these** refers to the foods that Haggai described in the previous verse, and the pronoun **it** refers to one of those foods that an unclean person might touch. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “any of these foods, will the food that he touched become unclean” or “any of these foods, would that make the food that he touched unclean”
2:13	pco4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִטְמָֽא	1	This is the counterpart to the priests’ answer in the previous verse. It may be helpful to indicate the implications of this answer explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “While a holy person does not communicate a holy state to objects that he touches, an unclean person does communicate an unclean state to objects that he touches, so any food that an unclean person touches does become unclean”

Alternate translation: “Yahweh of Armies declares that this people and this nation are thus to his face, and that every work of their hands is thus, and that what they offer there is unclean”
2:14	dv6p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כֵּ֣ן הָֽ⁠עָם־הַ֠⁠זֶּה וְ⁠כֵן־הַ⁠גּ֨וֹי הַ⁠זֶּ֤ה	1	The word **Thus** refers implicitly to a state of uncleanness. It may be helpful to indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “This people is unclean and this nation is unclean”

Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “These Judeans who have returned from exile are unclean”
2:14	ua4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנַ⁠י֙	1	Here Yahweh is using the term **face** to mean his presence, by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Presence, in turn, represents Yahweh’s judgment by association with the way that he would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “in my judgment”
2:14	ppt0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠פָנַ⁠י֙	1	Yahweh means implicitly that the Judeans are unclean because they have not obeyed him and rebuilt his temple. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in my judgment because they have not obeyed me and rebuilt my temple”
2:14	l3ow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠כֵ֖ן כָּל־מַעֲשֵׂ֣ה יְדֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Yahweh is using one part of the Judeans, their **hands**, to mean all of them in the act of working. The reference is specifically to their **work** of growing crops and raising animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and thus is all of the food that they produce” or “and all of the food that they produce is therefore unclean as well”
2:14	nybp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר יַקְרִ֛יבוּ שָׁ֖ם טָמֵ֥א הֽוּא	1	By **there**, Haggai implicitly means an altar that the returned exiles had set up at the temple site. This is described in [Ezra 3:1–6](../03/01.md). You can say that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and so what they offer on the altar that they have set up at the temple site is also unclean”
2:15	zlfb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שִֽׂימוּ־נָ֣א לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	See how you translated this expression in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: “consider carefully what has been happening”
2:15	l2sc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִן־הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה וָ⁠מָ֑עְלָ⁠ה	1	The word **before** refers back in time to the whole period after the Judeans returned from exile. Alternate translation: “from the time you returned from exile until now”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “before you began to rebuild the temple of Yahweh”
2:15	iq4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בְּ⁠הֵיכַ֥ל יְהוָֽה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “in my temple”
2:16	bguu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִֽ⁠הְיוֹתָ֥⁠ם	1	The pronoun **their** likely refers to the days that Haggai described in the previous verse, beginning with “this day” (the day on which he is speaking) and including all of the days since the return from exile before the Judeans began rebuilding the temple. Alternate translation: “During those days” or “During that whole time period”
2:16	a1et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	בָּא֙ אֶל־עֲרֵמַ֣ת עֶשְׂרִ֔ים וְ⁠הָיְתָ֖ה עֲשָׂרָ֑ה	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “when a person came to a heap of grain that he expected to contain twenty measures, he found that it contained only ten measures”
2:16	zx3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume	בָּא֙ אֶל־עֲרֵמַ֣ת עֶשְׂרִ֔ים וְ⁠הָיְתָ֖ה עֲשָׂרָ֑ה	1	By **twenty**, Yahweh most likely means twenty ephahs. An ephah was equivalent to about 22 liters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the quantity in modern measurements. Alternatively, to help your readers recognize that the biblical writings come from a long time ago when people used different measures, you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the ephah, and explain the equivalent in modern measurements in a footnote. Alternate translation: “when a person came to a heap of grain that he expected to contain twenty ephahs, he found that it contained only ten ephahs” or “when a person came to a heap that he expected to contain over 400 kilograms of grain, he found that it contained only about 200 kilograms”

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “when a person came to a wine vat from which he expected he could draw fifty press-measures, he found that it contained only twenty press-measures”
2:16	ply4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume	חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים פּוּרָ֔ה	1	The expression **from the press** probably describes a certain quantity of wine, a “press-measure,” the amount that a winepress would produce from a single pressing of a full load of grapes. However, it is no longer clear exactly what this quantity was. In your translation, you could use a liquid measure that your readers would recognize that would approximate this quantity, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “fifty gallons” or “fifty measures of wine”

2:17	grkc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֵין־אֶתְ⁠כֶ֥ם אֵלַ֖⁠י	1	Yahweh is using this expression to mean that the Judeans did not obey him and rebuild the temple. Instead, they continued to disobey, as if they had nothing to do with Yahweh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but you still did not return to me” or “but it was as if you wanted to have nothing to do with me”

2:23	t8m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כַּֽ⁠חוֹתָ֑ם	1	A **signet ring** was a special ring that a ruler could use to imprint an official seal on a document. This ring bore the ruler’s name or some symbol representing him. The ruler would roll up an important document and put wax on it, then press the ring into the wax to create an official seal. If the document had this mark on its seal, people would know that what was written in the document was written with the king’s authority and had to be obeyed. You could describe this as “like a ring that a ruler uses to create official seals”
2:23	xdbq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּֽ⁠חוֹתָ֑ם	1	The point of this comparison is that **Zerubbabel** would be an instrument of Yahweh’s authority, just as a ruler uses a **signet ring** as an instrument of his authority. All the nations would have to obey Zerubbabel’s commands because Zerubbabel would be commanding them with authority that Yahweh had entrusted to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “an instrument of my authority, like a signet ring”
