Yahweh will punish Judah and Jerusalem (1:2–18)\n“For in the fire of his jealousy the whole earth will be consumed.”\n2. Yahweh will punish the nations\n    * Warning to Judah (2:1–3)\n    * Yahweh will punish the Philistines (2:4–7)\n    * Yahweh will punish Moab and Ammon (2:8–11)\n    * Yahweh will punish Ethiopia (2:12)\n    * Yahweh will punish Assyria (2:13–16)\n    * Yahweh will punish Jerusalem (3:1–7)\n    * General review (3:8)\n“For in the fire of my jealousy the whole earth will be consumed.”\n3. Yahweh will restore Judah and Jerusalem (3:9–20)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Zephaniah?\n\nThis book records messages that Yahweh spoke through a man named Zephaniah. The title to the book lists Zephaniah’s ancestors back to his great-grandfather, a man named Hezekiah. Since no other prophet’s ancestry is traced back four generations, this Hezekiah must have been a significant person, and interpreters generally agree that he was King Hezekiah, who ruled over Judah from about 715 B.C. to about 686 B.C. So Zephaniah was likely a member of the royal family. In his prophecies, he shows a first-hand knowledge of the city of Jerusalem, so it is also probable that he was part of the royal court in Jerusalem. The title of the book says that he prophesied during the reign of King Josiah, who began to rule Judah around 640 B.C. So Zephaniah would have prophesied at about the same time that Jeremiah began to prophesy.\n\n### What is the book of Zephaniah about?\n\nThrough Zephaniah’s prophecies, Yahweh warned Judah and other nations that he was about to destroy them because of their wickedness and idolatry. This message seems to have led at least the Judeans to repent, if only for a generation. Hezekiah had been a godly ruler, but his son Manasseh and his grandson Amon were wicked and idolatrous kings. Amon was so unpopular that he was assassinated, and his son Josiah became king when Josiah was only a boy. But when Josiah became a young adult and could assert himself, he introduced a series of reforms that led the people of Judah to worship and obey Yahweh once more. The prophecies of Zephaniah seem to have influenced Josiah strongly to do this. Zephaniah also prophesied about how Yahweh would restore Judah, and those prophecies had at least a partial fulfillment in his own time due to the reforms of Josiah.\n\n### What title should translators use for this book?\n\nTranslators may choose to use the traditional title, “The Book of Zephaniah,” or simply “Zephaniah.” They may use a different title such as “The Prophecies of Zephaniah.”\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### The “day of Yahweh”\n\nZephaniah speaks many times of “the day of Yahweh,” meaning the time when Yahweh will judge and punish the nations, including Judah, for disobeying him and worshiping idols. However, in the final oracle in the book, the phrase “that day” instead means the time when Yahweh will restore Judah and Jerusalem. Notes suggest ways that you can translate these expressions in their various occurrences.\n\n### The time reference of Zephaniah’s prophecies\n\nSome of Zephaniah’s prophecies focus on specific places and times. They warn Judah and other nations that Yahweh will soon destroy them, and they suggest implicitly that this will happen when an enemy empire invades and conquers them. But other prophecies speak of the entire world, and their time reference is uncertain. For example, in the first prophecy in the book, Yahweh says that he is going to destroy every living creature on earth—people, animals, birds, and fish. This could be a prophecy about the more distant future, about the end of the world. But it could also be a generalization for emphasis, and if so, it could apply to the time of Josiah. It is not necessary to determine the exact time reference of all of the prophecies in the book in order to translate the book.\n\n### The identity of the invading empire\n\nZephaniah often suggests that a foreign empire will invade and conquer Judah and other nations. He probably means the empire of Babylon. However, he does not name it specifically, and so it would not be appropriate to use any particular name for the invading army that Zephaniah describes in this book.
1:intro	t3tv				0	# Zephaniah 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the first of the three major parts of the book of Zephaniah. (See the outline in the General Introduction to the book.) This part describes how Yahweh will punish Judah and Jerusalem for their sinfulness and complacency.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of verses 2–18 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nVerses 2 and 3 state in general terms that Yahweh’s judgment will be comprehensive. Then, in four places later in the chapter, prophecies emphasize a general point by making a series of specific statements that illustrate that point. These typically move from more obvious or central examples to more peripheral ones. In that way, they demonstrate how comprehensive Yahweh’s judgment will be: It will reach to the most distant and obscure places.\n\nSeries of statements such as these are known as litanies. If your readers would recognize the litany form, you could translate and format these litanies the way the ULT does, as lines of poetry. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format these litanies in a way that would illustrate how they work. You could format the general statement in a way that would set it off from the other poetry in the book. For example, if you have chosen to indent that poetry, you could present the general statement without any indentation. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n\nVerses 4–6:\n\nand I will cut off from this place\n> the remnant of Baal,\n> the name of the idol-priests with the priests,\n> and the ones bowing down on the housetops to the army of the skies,\n> and the ones bowing down, swearing to Yahweh but swearing by their king,\n> and the ones turning back from after Yahweh,\n> and who do not search for Yahweh and do not seek him.\n\nVerses 8–9:\n\nAnd it will happen on the day of the sacrifice of Yahweh that I will visit\n> upon the princes\n> and upon the sons of the king\n> and upon all the ones wearing foreign clothing,\nand on that day I will visit\n\n> upon all the ones leaping over the threshold,\n> the ones filling the house of their lords {with} violence and fraud.\n\nVerse 10:\n\nthe sound of\n\n> a cry from the Fish Gate\n> and a wailing from the Second {District}\n> and a great ruin from the hills.\n\nVerses 15–16:\n\nThat day {will be}\n\n> a day of wrath,\n> a day of distress and anguish,\n> a day of destruction and desolation,\n> a day of darkness and gloom,\n> a day of cloud and overcast,\n> a day of horn and battle-cry against the fortified cities and against the high towers.
1:1	k2ge		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דְּבַר־יְהוָ֣ה ׀ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הָיָ֗ה אֶל־צְפַנְיָה֙	1	In this title for the book, the term **word** refers to the message that Yahweh sent to the Judeans through Zephaniah by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The message that Yahweh sent through Zephaniah”
1:1	zlc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	בֶּן־כּוּשִׁ֣י בֶן־גְּדַלְיָ֔ה בֶּן־אֲמַרְיָ֖ה בֶּן־חִזְקִיָּ֑ה	1	The author is describing the ancestors of **Zephaniah** in order to introduce him to readers as a key participant in the book, the person through whom Yahweh spoke the messages that the book records. Your culture may have its own way of introducing people by describing their ancestors, and if so, you can use it here in your translation.
1:1	yy5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	צְפַנְיָה֙ & כּוּשִׁ֣י & גְּדַלְיָ֔ה & אֲמַרְיָ֖ה & חִזְקִיָּ֑ה & יֹאשִׁיָּ֥הוּ & אָמ֖וֹן	1	The words **Zephaniah**, **Cushi**, **Gedaliah**, **Amariah**, **Hezekiah**, **Josiah**, and **Amon** are the names of men.
1:1	z000		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בִּ⁠ימֵ֛י יֹאשִׁיָּ֥הוּ בֶן־אָמ֖וֹן מֶ֥לֶךְ יְהוּדָֽה	1	In this title, the term **days** means a specific time, the reign of **Josiah** as **king of Judah**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “during the reign of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah”
1:2	fg27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אָסֹ֨ף אָסֵ֜ף כֹּ֗ל מֵ⁠עַ֛ל פְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה נְאֻם־יְהוָֽה	1	Zephaniah is using the phrase **the declaration of Yahweh** to indicate that he is quoting the message that Yahweh has given him for the people of Judah. Consider natural ways of identifying direct quotations in your language. It may be more natural for you to put this attribution of the saying to Yahweh before the saying itself, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “This is what Yahweh declares: ‘Removing, I will exterminate everything from upon the face of the ground’”
1:2	x2u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	אָסֹ֨ף אָסֵ֜ף כֹּ֗ל מֵ⁠עַ֛ל פְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה	1	When Yahweh says that he is going to destroy **everything** on the surface of the earth, he is probably making an overstatement for emphasis. He wants to express how angry he is at the sinful disobedience of people. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “I will cause very great destruction on the earth”
1:2	z142		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	אָסֹ֨ף אָסֵ֜ף כֹּ֗ל	1	Yahweh is using one verb and a different verb of similar meaning together in order to intensify the idea that these verbs express. Ordinarily in this construction, the same verb would be used twice. But here two verbs of similar sound and meaning are used for poetic effect and emphasis. If your language can repeat verbs for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If it has two verbs of similar sound and meaning that you can use, that would reflect the poetic effect here. Your language may also have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will totally exterminate everything”
1:2	z001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the surface of the earth or ground were literally its **face**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the surface of the earth”
1:3	t70v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	נְאֻם־יְהוָֽה	1	See how you translated the phrase **the declaration of Yahweh** in the previous verse. If you used it to introduce the quotation there, you may wish to do the same thing here.
1:3	zd2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	אָסֵ֨ף אָדָ֜ם וּ⁠בְהֵמָ֗ה אָסֵ֤ף עוֹף־הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙ וּ⁠דְגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּ֔ם	1	Yahweh is using creatures from the three components of creation—land creatures, sky creatures, and **sea** creatures—to mean all creatures throughout creation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “I will take away all the creatures that live everywhere in creation”
1:3	z003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָדָ֜ם וּ⁠בְהֵמָ֗ה & הָ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that clearly includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “humans and beasts … humans”
1:3	z002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	אָדָ֜ם וּ⁠בְהֵמָ֗ה	1	Yahweh is using two types of creatures that live on the earth, **man** and **beast**, to mean all creatures that live on the earth. If you would like to retain in your translation the references in this verse to the three different parts of creation, you could explain the meaning of this reference. Alternate translation: “all the creatures that live on the earth”
1:3	z004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠הַ⁠מַּכְשֵׁל֖וֹת אֶת־הָ⁠רְשָׁעִ֑ים	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and the stumbling blocks with wicked people”
1:3	kw4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הַ⁠מַּכְשֵׁל֖וֹת	1	Yahweh is speaking of idols as if they were literally **stumbling blocks**, that is, objects that people would trip over. He is using stumbling to mean doing what is morally and spiritually wrong. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the idols”
1:3	z005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הָ⁠רְשָׁעִ֑ים	1	The implication is that the **wicked** people Yahweh is talking about are doing things that are morally and spiritually wrong because their actions are being guided by the values implicit in idolatry rather than by Yahweh’s law. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “with the people who are wicked because they worship idols”
1:3	aqr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠הִכְרַתִּ֣י אֶת־הָ⁠אָדָ֗ם מֵ⁠עַ֛ל פְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה	1	When Yahweh says that he will kill all the people who live on earth, as in verse 2, he is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “and the wicked people who are disobeying me, I will punish by killing them”
1:3	z143		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠הִכְרַתִּ֣י אֶת־הָ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “and I will cut off all people”
1:3	xxd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִכְרַתִּ֣י אֶת־הָ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he were going to **cut off** the people who live on the earth the way one would cut a branch off from a tree. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy all people” or “and I will eliminate all people”
1:3	z006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה	1	See how you translated this expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the surface of the earth”
1:4	q6dj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠נָטִ֤יתִי יָדִ⁠י֙	1	Here, **hand** represents the power that a person has to do something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And I will use my power”
1:4	gdu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִכְרַתִּ֞י מִן־הַ⁠מָּק֤וֹם הַ⁠זֶּה֙	1	See how you translated the expression **cut off** in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “and I will remove from this place” or “and I will eliminate from this place”
1:4	zb97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	וְ⁠הִכְרַתִּ֞י מִן־הַ⁠מָּק֤וֹם הַ⁠זֶּה֙	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this phrase is the beginning of a litany. You may use that discussion to help you consider how to format the material in verses 4–6.
1:4	z007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־שְׁאָ֣ר הַ⁠בַּ֔עַל	1	Yahweh is using the name **Baal** by association to mean the worship of Baal, a false god. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the remnant of Baal-worship”
1:4	z008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־שְׁאָ֣ר הַ⁠בַּ֔עַל	1	The worship of **Baal** had not been reduced to a **remnant** at this time. As the General Introduction to Zephaniah explains, the prophet spoke these oracles to warn the people of Judah that they needed to stop worshiping Baal. So Yahweh is using this expression to mean that he will destroy Baal worship so completely that nothing is left—there will be no remnant. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “every last trace of Baal worship”
1:4	wn2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֶת־שֵׁ֥ם הַ⁠כְּמָרִ֖ים עִם־הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִֽים	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “yes, I will cut off the name of the idol-priests with the priests” or “yes, I will destroy the name of the idol-priests with the priests”
1:4	h6cv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־שֵׁ֥ם	1	Here, **name** represents the reputation of an individual, which extends beyond the place and time in which that individual is known personally. When someone’s **name** in this sense is destroyed, no one remembers that person any longer. Alternate translation: “the memory of”
1:4	z009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עִם־הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִֽים	1	The term **priests** probably refers to the priests descended from Aaron who were supposed to lead the Israelites in the worship of Yahweh. Unfortunately, at this time they were not serving Yahweh faithfully, as Zephaniah says in [3:4](../03/04.md). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “along with the degenerate priests from the line of Aaron”
1:5	u98g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מִּשְׁתַּחֲוִ֥ים עַל־הַ⁠גַּגּ֖וֹת לִ⁠צְבָ֣א הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יִם וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֣ים לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה וְ⁠הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֖ים בְּ⁠מַלְכָּֽ⁠ם	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and I will cut off the ones bowing down on the housetops to the army of the skies, and I will cut off the ones bowing down, swearing to Yahweh but swearing by their king” or “and I will destroy the ones bowing down on the housetops to the army of the skies, and I will destroy the ones bowing down, swearing to Yahweh but swearing by their king”
1:5	z010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מִּשְׁתַּחֲוִ֥ים עַל־הַ⁠גַּגּ֖וֹת לִ⁠צְבָ֣א	1	Yahweh is using one aspect of worship, **bowing down**, to mean worship generally. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy the ones who worship the army of”
1:5	z011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠צְבָ֣א הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יִם	1	Yahweh is speaking of the sun, moon, and stars as if they were an **army** in the **skies**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the heavenly bodies”
1:5	z012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֣ים לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “and the ones bowing down, swearing to me”
1:5	z013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֣ים לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה	1	The terms **bowing down** and **swearing to** mean similar things. They both indicate worship; **bowing down**, one aspect of worship, represents worship generally, while the expression **swearing to** describes pledging oneself to worship Yahweh as God. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis since, as the rest of the verse shows, this worship was not wholehearted. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the ones appearing to worship me devotedly”
1:5	w2r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֣ים לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה וְ⁠הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֖ים בְּ⁠מַלְכָּֽ⁠ם	1	The word translated **their king** could be the name of a false god, Milcom, also called Molech, Molek, or Moloch. If you choose to use the name in your translation, spell it the way it sounds in your language. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the spelling that it uses. Alternate translation: “swearing to me but swearing by Milcom”
1:5	z014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֣ים לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה וְ⁠הַ⁠נִּשְׁבָּעִ֖ים בְּ⁠מַלְכָּֽ⁠ם	1	Yahweh is drawing a contrast between **swearing to** and **swearing by**. The Judeans who swore **to** Yahweh pledged themselves to worship him as their God. But they then swore **by** Milcom, invoking the name of that false god to guarantee a vow or promise that they had made. Yahweh is saying how inconsistent and inappropriate it was for them to do that. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “pledging themselves to worship me but then guaranteeing their oaths by invoking the false god Milcom”
1:6	z015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠נְּסוֹגִ֖ים מֵ⁠אַחֲרֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹֽא־בִקְשׁ֥וּ אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א דְרָשֻֽׁ⁠הוּ	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “and the ones turning back from after me, and who do not search for me and do not seek me”
1:6	z016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠נְּסוֹגִ֖ים מֵ⁠אַחֲרֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹֽא־בִקְשׁ֥וּ אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א דְרָשֻֽׁ⁠הוּ	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. This could be describing: (1) two groups, people who are no longer actively worshiping Yahweh and people who still worship Yahweh formally but who do not relate to him actively as their God. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy those who have stopped worshiping me actively, and I will destroy those who still worship me formally but do not relate to me actively as their God” (2) one group, people who show that they are no longer worshiping Yahweh by the way they no longer relate to him actively as their God. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy those who show they have stopped worshiping me by the way they no longer relate to me actively as their God”
1:6	z017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠נְּסוֹגִ֖ים מֵ⁠אַחֲרֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the Judeans who are ceasing to worship him were literally walking on a path and **turning back** from the direction in which they had been heading. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy the ones who have stopped worshiping me”
1:6	ql66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹֽא־בִקְשׁ֥וּ אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א דְרָשֻֽׁ⁠הוּ	1	Yahweh could be using the expressions **search for** and **seek** to mean: (1) two similar things. He could be speaking as if the Judeans should literally have been looking for him, meaning that they should have been praying to him. In this case Yahweh would be using two similar terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase Alternate translation: “and I will destroy the ones who no longer pray to me at all” (2) two different things. The expression **search for** could mean to ask for help, and the expression **seek** could mean to ask for guidance. Alternate translation: “and I will destroy those who no longer ask for my help or guidance”
1:7	z018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ֕ס מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י אֲדֹנָ֣⁠י יְהוִ֑ה	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “Hush in the presence of Lord Yahweh”
1:7	etv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	הַ֕ס מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י אֲדֹנָ֣⁠י יְהוִ֑ה	1	The word **Hush** is an exclamation that urges listeners to be silent. In your translation, you may choose to use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. You could also translate the word as an imperative. Alternate translation: “Shh! in the presence of Lord Yahweh”
1:7	z019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קָרוֹב֙ י֣וֹם יְהוָ֔ה	1	The expression **the day of Yahweh** refers to a specific time when God will punish people for their sins. Alternate translation: “the time is coming soon when Yahweh will punish people for their sins”
1:7	xb5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֵכִ֧ין יְהוָ֛ה זֶ֖בַח הִקְדִּ֥ישׁ קְרֻאָֽי⁠ו	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if Yahweh had literally **prepared a sacrifice** and ceremonially cleansed (**sanctified**) those he had **invited** to share a meal from the meat of the sacrificed animal. He is speaking of the people of Judah as if they were this sacrifice, and of an enemy army, most likely that of the Babylonians, as if it would feast on the Judeans, meaning that this foreign power would conquer them and plunder them, as verses 13–16 indicate. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh is going to allow a foreign army to conquer and plunder the land of Judah”
1:7	hwp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	קְרֻאָֽי⁠ו	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the ones he has invited”
1:8	z023		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	וְ⁠הָיָ֗ה בְּ⁠יוֹם֙ זֶ֣בַח יְהוָ֔ה	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this phrase is the beginning of a litany. You may use that discussion to help you consider how to format the material in verses 8–9.
1:8	w2xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בְּ⁠יוֹם֙ זֶ֣בַח יְהוָ֔ה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “on the day of my sacrifice”
1:8	z020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠יוֹם֙ זֶ֣בַח יְהוָ֔ה	1	As Zephaniah did in the previous verse, Yahweh is speaking as if he is literally going to offer a sacrifice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on the day when I punish you Judeans for your sins”
1:8	z021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠יוֹם֙ זֶ֣בַח יְהוָ֔ה	1	See how you translated the expression “the day of Yahweh” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “at the time when I punish you Judeans for your sins”
1:8	z022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠פָקַדְתִּ֥י עַל־הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים וְ⁠עַל־בְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ וְ⁠עַ֥ל כָּל־הַ⁠לֹּבְשִׁ֖ים מַלְבּ֥וּשׁ נָכְרִֽי	1	The expression **visit upon** means to punish. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that I will punish the princes and the sons of the king and all the ones wearing foreign clothing”
1:8	z024		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים	1	In some languages the term **princes** describes male direct descendants of a monarch, but here it means court officials who may or may not have been members of the royal family. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the court officials”
1:8	z025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	This could mean: (1) the actual members of the royal family. In that case, the word **sons** would have a generic sense, applying to both men and women, and it would mean not just the literal children of the present king but also the grandchildren and even later descendants of previous kings. Alternate translation: “the royal family” (2) the literal sons of the present king, Josiah, who would have been just boys at this time. The implication is that Yahweh is going to punish the Judeans so thoroughly that not even children will be spared. Alternate translation: “even the king’s young boys”
1:8	igq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָּל־הַ⁠לֹּבְשִׁ֖ים מַלְבּ֥וּשׁ נָכְרִֽי	1	Yahweh is using one thing that the Judeans were doing to curry favor with foreign powers, wearing the same **clothing** that they did, to mean everything that they did to curry favor, especially including worshiping their gods. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all those who have adopted foreign ways”
1:9	gma8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠פָקַדְתִּ֗י עַ֧ל & בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֑וּא	1	See how you translated the expressions “on the day” and “I will visit upon” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “and at the time when I punish you Judeans, I will punish”
1:9	fr1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּל־הַ⁠דּוֹלֵ֛ג עַל־הַ⁠מִּפְתָּ֖ן	1	The expression **leaping over the threshold** seems to refer to people entering other people’s houses forcibly, as if in a rush, in order to seize their possessions by **violence** or **fraud**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all those who enter other people’s houses violently in order to seize their possessions”
1:9	z026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	הַֽ⁠מְמַלְאִ֛ים בֵּ֥ית אֲדֹנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם חָמָ֥ס וּ⁠מִרְמָֽה	1	Yahweh is using the plural form **lords** in a context where the singular term “lord” would suffice. This suggests that he may be using the plural form as a superlative to indicate the supreme example of its own class, in which case this would be a reference to the king, the lord or master of the Judeans. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “who have filled the house of their king with violence and fraud” or “who have filled the royal palace with violence and fraud”
1:9	u614		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חָמָ֥ס וּ⁠מִרְמָֽה	1	Yahweh is using the terms **violence** and **fraud** by association to mean possessions unlawfully obtained from others by violence or on fraudulent grounds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with possessions that they have gotten violently or fraudulently”
1:10	n2di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וְ⁠הָיָה֩ בַ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠ה֜וּא נְאֻם־יְהוָ֗ה ק֤וֹל	1	See how you translated the phrase **the declaration of Yahweh** in verses 2 and 3. Alternate translation: “This is what Yahweh declares: ‘And it will happen on that day, the sound of’”
1:10	z027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בַ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠ה֜וּא	1	See how you translated the expressions “on that day” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “at the time when I punish you Judeans for your sins”
1:10	ysx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ק֤וֹל	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “that people will hear the sound of”
1:10	mm2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מִ⁠שַּׁ֣עַר הַ⁠דָּגִ֔ים	1	The expression **the Fish Gate** is the name of one of the gates in the wall of the ancient city of Jerusalem. It may have had that name because there was a fish market just outside this gate. If your language has a term for “fish,” you could use that term to translate this name. If not, you could translate the name the way it sounds in your language.
1:10	bm2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠מִּשְׁנֶ֑ה	1	The word **Second** is the name of one of the districts in the ancient city of Jerusalem. The ULT adds the word **District** to show that. This district may have had that name because it had been added to the original city. Some translations use a name for it that indicates that. Alternate translation: “the New Quarter”
1:10	ahw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠הַ⁠גְּבָעֽוֹת	1	Yahweh is using the term **hills** by association to mean the settlements on the hills around Jerusalem. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the settlements on the hills around Jerusalem”
1:11	z028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠מַּכְתֵּ֑שׁ	1	The word **Maktesh** is the name of one of the districts in the ancient city of Jerusalem. It seems to have been a place where many goods were bought and sold, and so some translations refer to it with a descriptive phrase rather than with this name. Alternate translation: “the market district”
1:11	ne51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	נִדְמָה֙ כָּל־עַ֣ם כְּנַ֔עַן נִכְרְת֖וּ כָּל־נְטִ֥ילֵי כָֽסֶף	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Yahweh is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “all of the merchants and traders who make your district such a prosperous place will be completely destroyed”
1:11	z029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִדְמָה֙ כָּל־עַ֣ם כְּנַ֔עַן נִכְרְת֖וּ כָּל־נְטִ֥ילֵי כָֽסֶף	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I am going to destroy all of the people of Canaan; yes, I am going to cut off all of the ones weighing silver”
1:11	z030		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַ֣ם כְּנַ֔עַן	1	In this context, the expression **people of Canaan** refers to traders, not to those from the Canaanite people group. Many traders were Phoenicians, that is, Canaanites, and that is how the profession got this name, but the reference is to the profession and not to the people group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the traders”
1:11	fu79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נְטִ֥ילֵי כָֽסֶף	1	Yahweh is using the expression **the ones weighing silver** by association to mean merchants. In this culture, people used silver as money, determining its value by its weight. So merchants would weigh silver in order to determine how much of it to pay for goods or to accept in payment for them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the merchants”
1:11	eyb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נִכְרְת֖וּ	1	See how you translated the expression “cut off” in verse 3. Alternate translation: “will be destroyed”
1:12	n4xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בַּ⁠נֵּר֑וֹת	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he is literally going to use **lamps** in order to **search** for evildoers so that he can find them and punish them. He means that he is going to search thoroughly, as if using a lamp in order to see into all dark corners where someone or something might escape notice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “thoroughly”
1:12	z031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠פָקַדְתִּ֣י עַל	1	See how you translated the expression “I will visit upon” in verse 8. Alternate translation: “and I will punish”
1:12	z032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֗ים הַ⁠קֹּֽפְאִים֙ עַל־שִׁמְרֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	Here the masculine term **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “the people who are thickening on their sediment”
1:12	sb9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֗ים הַ⁠קֹּֽפְאִים֙ עַל־שִׁמְרֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the sinful, complacent people of Jerusalem were literally wine that is **thickening** because it has been left on its **sediment**. The term “sediment” describes the small pieces of stem, leaves, and seeds from grape plants that are unintentionally mixed with the juice during the winemaking process. Ordinarily, these are allowed to settle to the bottom of the wine, which is then poured off to separate it from them. Yahweh means that just as wine left on its sediment becomes thick, so these Judeans have become difficult to motivate to repentance. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. You may wish to represent the image as a comparison and explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “the people who have become so complacent” or “the people who have become so complacent that they are like wine that has thickened because no one has poured it off its sediment”
1:12	t4ux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	הָ⁠אֹֽמְרִים֙ בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠ם לֹֽא־יֵיטִ֥יב יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָרֵֽעַ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “the ones saying in their heart that Yahweh will not do good and that he will not do bad”
1:12	z033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הָ⁠אֹֽמְרִים֙ בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠ם לֹֽא־יֵיטִ֥יב יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָרֵֽעַ	1	If you decide to turn this quotation within a quotation into an indirect quotation, then Yahweh would be speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “the ones saying in their heart that I will not do good and that I will not do bad”
1:12	nu98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠ם	1	Here the **heart** represents the thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in their thoughts” or “to themselves”
1:12	z034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠ם	1	Since Job is speaking of many people, if you retain the image of **heart** in your translation, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of the word. Alternate translation: “in their hearts”
1:12	fhk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־יֵיטִ֥יב יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָרֵֽעַ	1	By **do good**, these people are implicitly referring to Yahweh rewarding them, and by **do bad**, they are referring to Yahweh punishing them. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. You could also bring out the further implication in what the people are saying: that Yahweh is not a God who enforces justice in the world, so they may act as they wish. Alternate translation: “Yahweh is not going to reward us, and he is not going to punish us” or “Yahweh is not the kind of God who rewards good people and punishes wicked people, so it does not matter how we live”
1:13	nu8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה חֵילָ⁠ם֙ לִ⁠מְשִׁסָּ֔ה וּ⁠בָתֵּי⁠הֶ֖ם לִ⁠שְׁמָמָ֑ה	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and their wealth will become plunder and their houses will become a ruin”
1:13	z035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה חֵילָ⁠ם֙ לִ⁠מְשִׁסָּ֔ה וּ⁠בָתֵּי⁠הֶ֖ם לִ⁠שְׁמָמָ֑ה	1	Yahweh does not mean that these things will happen on their own. He means implicitly that the enemy army he describes in verse 16 will plunder the wealth of these complacent Judeans and ruin their houses. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “An enemy army will plunder their wealth and ruin their houses”
1:13	z036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	וּ⁠בָנ֤וּ בָתִּים֙ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יֵשֵׁ֔בוּ וְ⁠נָטְע֣וּ כְרָמִ֔ים וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִשְׁתּ֖וּ אֶת־יֵינָֽ⁠ם	1	Yahweh is alluding to what he told the Israelites would happen if they disobeyed him and worshiped false gods. When the Israelites first left Egypt, he told them through Moses that if they did those things, “You shall build a house but not live in it; you shall plant a vineyard but not use it” ([Deuteronomy 28:30](../deu/28/30.md)). Yahweh is quoting his own words to show that they would be fulfilled in the case of these Judeans. To indicate that in your translation, you could present this as a direct quotation, using second-level quotation marks or some other convention of your language. Alternate translation: “and ‘they will build houses, but they will not inhabit {them}, and they will plant vineyards, but they will not drink their wine’”
1:14	ky2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יוֹם־יְהוָה֙ הַ⁠גָּד֔וֹל & י֣וֹם יְהוָ֔ה	1	See how you translated the expression “the day of Yahweh” in verse 7. Alternate translation: “the awful time when Yahweh will punish people for their sins … the time when Yahweh will punish people”
1:14	z037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יוֹם־יְהוָה֙ הַ⁠גָּד֔וֹל & י֣וֹם יְהוָ֔ה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “the awful time when I will punish people for their sins … the time when I will punish people”
1:14	a6kw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	קָר֤וֹב & קָר֖וֹב וּ⁠מַהֵ֣ר מְאֹ֑ד	1	Yahweh is repeating the word **near** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “very near and hastening quickly”
1:14	z038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	קָר֤וֹב & קָר֖וֹב וּ⁠מַהֵ֣ר מְאֹ֑ד	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **day** or time when he will punish people were a living thing that was **hastening** to arrive. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “near; yes, it will happen very soon”
1:14	z039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ק֚וֹל י֣וֹם יְהוָ֔ה מַ֥ר	1	Yahweh is speaking of the **sound of the day** by association to mean the sounds that people will make on that **day**, that is, at that time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “People will weep bitterly on the day of Yahweh”
1:14	nu8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	צֹרֵ֖חַ & גִּבּֽוֹר	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **warrior**. He means a certain group of warriors in general. This could mean: (1) that the warriors who are trying to defend Judah will cry out in despair as they are defeated. Alternate translation: “the defenders of Judah will cry out in despair” (2) that the warriors of the enemy army that attacks Judah will shout a battle cry, as verse 16 describes. Alternate translation: “the invading warriors will shout a terrifying battle cry”
1:15	z040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֑וּא	1	If you have been translating the phrase “the day of Yahweh” with an expression that uses the word “time,” you may wish to say “time” rather than **day** in each of the instances in this verse.
1:15	lw4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	י֧וֹם צָרָ֣ה וּ⁠מְצוּקָ֗ה י֤וֹם שֹׁאָה֙ וּ⁠מְשׁוֹאָ֔ה י֥וֹם חֹ֨שֶׁךְ֙ וַ⁠אֲפֵלָ֔ה י֥וֹם עָנָ֖ן וַ⁠עֲרָפֶֽל	1	In these four cases, Yahweh is using two words with similar meaning together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “a day of great distress, a day of severe destruction, a day of deep darkness, a day of thick cloud”
1:15	z041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	י֥וֹם חֹ֨שֶׁךְ֙ וַ⁠אֲפֵלָ֔ה י֥וֹם עָנָ֖ן וַ⁠עֲרָפֶֽל	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the sky will literally be dark and cloudy at the time when he punishes people for their sins. He means that it will be a time when people experience much trouble and feel great sorrow. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a day of terrible trouble, a day of deep sorrow”
1:16	z042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	י֥וֹם	1	If you have been translating the phrase “the day of Yahweh” with an expression that uses the word “time,” you may wish to say “time” rather than **day** here. Alternate translation: “a time of”
1:16	deb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שׁוֹפָ֖ר וּ⁠תְרוּעָ֑ה	1	Yahweh is referring to a ram’s **horn**, a shofar, that soldiers would use to signal an attack. Yahweh is using the term by association to mean the sound that this horn would make. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be more natural in your language to use plural forms here. Alternate translation: “horn blasts and battle-cries”
1:16	z043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַ֚ל הֶ⁠עָרִ֣ים הַ⁠בְּצֻר֔וֹת וְ⁠עַ֖ל הַ⁠פִּנּ֥וֹת הַ⁠גְּבֹהֽוֹת	1	Yahweh is using the term **corners** by association to mean the towers that were built at the corners of the walls around cities in the kingdom of Judah. Those walls were not straight; they had angles and corners so that defenders could attack besieging armies from more than one direction. High towers were built at the corners so that the defenders could attack from a height. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “against the fortified cities and against the high towers at the corners of their walls”
1:16	z044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	עַ֚ל הֶ⁠עָרִ֣ים הַ⁠בְּצֻר֔וֹת וְ⁠עַ֖ל הַ⁠פִּנּ֥וֹת הַ⁠גְּבֹהֽוֹת	1	The phrases **fortified cities** and **high corners** mean similar things. The high towers at the corners of city walls were one part of their fortifications. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the walled cities and all of their fortifications”
1:17	z045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לָ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. The reference is most likely to the sinful, complacent Judeans. Alternate translation: “to the people of Judah”
1:17	z046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠הָֽלְכוּ֙ כַּֽ⁠עִוְרִ֔ים כִּ֥י	1	This is a further allusion to what Yahweh told the Israelites when they first left Egypt, like the allusion in verse 13. In [Deuteronomy 28:29](../deu/28/29.md), Yahweh told the Israelites that if they disobeyed him and worshiped false gods, “you will be groping about at noon, as the blind grope in the darkness.” To indicate that Yahweh is quoting his own words, you could present this as a direct quotation, using second-level quotation marks or some other convention of your language. Alternate translation: “and ‘they will walk like the blind,’ for”
1:17	krq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠הָֽלְכוּ֙ כַּֽ⁠עִוְרִ֔ים	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a person who is **blind** does not know in what direction he should **walk** in order to arrive somewhere safely, so the Judeans will not be able to find any safe place to escape from the enemy army. Yahweh is not saying that blindness is a punishment for sin. Alternate translation: “and they will not be able to find any place where it is safe”
1:17	z047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	כַּֽ⁠עִוְרִ֔ים	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **blind** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “as blind people do”
1:17	z048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠שֻׁפַּ֤ךְ דָּמָ⁠ם֙ כֶּֽ⁠עָפָ֔ר וּ⁠לְחֻמָ֖⁠ם כַּ⁠גְּלָלִֽים	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And their blood will be poured out like dust, and their innards will be poured out like dung”
1:17	z049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠שֻׁפַּ֤ךְ דָּמָ⁠ם֙ כֶּֽ⁠עָפָ֔ר וּ⁠לְחֻמָ֖⁠ם כַּ⁠גְּלָלִֽים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And their enemies will wound them so that their blood flows out like dust and their innards flow out like dung”
1:17	cq1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠שֻׁפַּ֤ךְ דָּמָ⁠ם֙ כֶּֽ⁠עָפָ֔ר וּ⁠לְחֻמָ֖⁠ם כַּ⁠גְּלָלִֽים	1	The point of these comparisons is that just as people consider **dust** and **dung** to have no value, the **blood** and **innards** of the Judeans, vital to their lives, will be **poured out** as if those substances and the lives they sustain had no value. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “And their enemies will wound them so that their blood and their innards flow out profusely, as if they were worthless”
1:18	z050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	גַּם־כַּסְפָּ֨⁠ם גַּם־זְהָבָ֜⁠ם לֹֽא־יוּכַ֣ל לְ⁠הַצִּילָ֗⁠ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **silver** and the **gold** that the Judeans own were living things that could **deliver them** from their enemies. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They will not even be able to pay their enemies silver or gold in order to be spared”
1:18	z051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בְ⁠אֵשׁ֙ קִנְאָת֔⁠וֹ תֵּאָכֵ֖ל כָּל־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “For the fire of his jealousy will consume the whole earth”
1:18	ai7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְ⁠אֵשׁ֙ קִנְאָת֔⁠וֹ תֵּאָכֵ֖ל כָּל־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if his **jealousy** were a **fire** that is literally going to burn up the entire **earth**. As the next sentence indicates, he is using the term “earth” to mean the people who live on the earth, and he is referring to the way that he will punish those people for worshiping false gods and living sinfully. He is speaking of that punishment as if it were a fire. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “For he will destroy all of the people who live on the earth when he punishes them in his jealousy”
1:18	z052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠בְ⁠אֵשׁ֙ קִנְאָת֔⁠וֹ תֵּאָכֵ֖ל כָּל־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **jealousy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Zephaniah is saying that Yahweh is jealous because the people who live on the earth have been worshiping false gods even though they owe him their exclusive worship because he is the only true God. Alternate translation: Alternate translation: “For he will destroy all of the people who live on the earth when he punishes them because he is jealous that they have been worshiping false gods instead of him, the only true God”
1:18	z053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָלָ֤ה אַךְ־נִבְהָלָה֙ יַֽעֲשֶׂ֔ה אֵ֥ת כָּל־יֹשְׁבֵ֖י הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **consummation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he will end the lives of all the inhabitants of the earth, and he will do that quickly”
1:18	ij81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־יֹשְׁבֵ֖י הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Since Yahweh does not kill righteous people along with wicked people, the word **all** may be a generalization for emphasis, or the expression **the inhabitants of the earth** may refer specifically to wicked people. Alternate translation: “many of the people who live on the earth” or “the wicked people who disobey him”
1:18	z054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִבְהָלָה֙	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The word translated **hastened** could mean: (1) that Yahweh will quickly do what he is describing. Alternate translation: “he will do this soon” (2) that when Yahweh does this, it will terrify people. Alternate translation: “a terrifying one”

This part begins with a warning to the people of Judah and Jerusalem (verses 1–3), and it then describes how Yahweh will punish the Philistines (verses 4–7), Moab and Ammon (verses 8–11), Ethiopia (verse 12), and Assyria (verses 13–16).\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 1 and 2, Zephaniah uses the litany form, as he did four times in chapter 1. See the discussion of the litany form in the General Notes to chapter 1, and see how you formatted the litanies in that chapter. You may wish to present the general statement in verse 1 without any indentation and then put each sentence of verse 2 on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n\nGather yourselves together! Yes, gather, O nation not desired,\n> before the bringing forth of the decree,\n> before the day passes like chaff,\n> before the burning of the nose of Yahweh does not come upon you,\n> before the day of the nose of Yahweh does not come upon you.
2:1	w14p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הִֽתְקוֹשְׁשׁ֖וּ וָ⁠ק֑וֹשּׁוּ	1	Zephaniah is repeating the verb **Gather** in order to emphasize the idea that it expresses. If a speaker of your language would not do that, you may be able to express the emphasis in another way in your translation. Alternate translation: “It is urgent that you gather together”
2:1	z055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	הִֽתְקוֹשְׁשׁ֖וּ וָ⁠ק֑וֹשּׁוּ	1	The word **yourselves** is plural because Zephaniah is addressing the Judeans as a group. The implied “you” in each of these imperative forms is also plural. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (The word “you” and the implied “you” in imperatives continue to be plural in verses 2 and 3.)
2:1	z056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִֽתְקוֹשְׁשׁ֖וּ	1	Zephaniah is implicitly telling the Judeans to **Gather … together** in order to repent. That is, he is telling them that they urgently need to hold a solemn assembly in which they confess and forsake their sins and ask Yahweh to be merciful to them. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Gather yourselves together in repentance”
2:1	z057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי לֹ֥א נִכְסָֽף	1	Zephaniah is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The phrase translated **not desired** could mean: (1) that Yahweh does not want to be close to this nation because he is so angry with its people over their sinfulness and idolatry. Alternate translation: “O nation with whom Yahweh is so angry” (2) that the people of this nation are not ashamed of the wrong things that they have been doing. Alternate translation: “O shameless nation”
2:1	z058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי לֹ֥א נִכְסָֽף	1	Zephaniah is implicitly addressing the **nation** of Judah. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you Judeans with whom Yahweh is so angry” or “you shameless Judeans”
2:2	m93y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠טֶ֨רֶם֙ לֶ֣דֶת חֹ֔ק	1	Zephaniah is using this possessive form not to describe something **bringing forth** the **decree** but to speak of the **decree** as if it would be **bringing forth** something, that is, as if it would literally be giving birth to something. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to use plain language. Alternate translation: “before the decree takes effect”
2:2	z059		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠טֶ֨רֶם֙ לֶ֣דֶת חֹ֔ק	1	Zephaniah is referring implicitly to the **decree** of Yahweh that he announced in the previous chapter. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “before Yahweh carries out his decree to destroy sinful people”
2:2	j7xn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	י֑וֹם	1	By **the day**, Zephaniah means the “day of Yahweh.” See how you translated that expression in chapter 1. Alternate translation: “the time when Yahweh punishes people for their sins”
2:2	m9s2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠מֹ֖ץ עָ֣בַר	1	The point of this comparison is that just as the wind blows away **chaff** so that it is gone and will not return, so the **day** of Yahweh will come and go, and afterwards there will be no further opportunity for people to repent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “before … has come and gone and there is no further opportunity to repent”
2:2	xg13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠טֶ֣רֶם ׀ לֹא־יָב֣וֹא עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֗ם חֲרוֹן֙ אַף־יְהוָ֔ה בְּ⁠טֶ֨רֶם֙ לֹא־יָב֣וֹא עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֔ם י֖וֹם אַף־יְהוָֽה	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Zephaniah is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. However, rather than combine the phrases and show the emphasis in another way, it may be good to include both phrases in your translation, since they are part of a litany. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of the litany form and how you might format verses 1–2 to show that Zephaniah is using this form.
2:2	z060		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	בְּ⁠טֶ֣רֶם ׀ לֹא־יָב֣וֹא עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֗ם חֲרוֹן֙ אַף־יְהוָ֔ה	1	Zephaniah is using a negative expression to describe an outcome that he is urging the people of Judah to avoid. He is effectively telling them to pursue the purpose of avoiding that outcome. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. The clause itself may be negative or positive, depending on the conventions of your language. Alternate translation: “so that the burning of the nose of Yahweh does not come upon you” or “lest the burning of the nose of Yahweh come upon you”
2:2	c8mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠טֶ֣רֶם ׀ לֹא־יָב֣וֹא עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֗ם חֲרוֹן֙ אַף־יְהוָ֔ה	1	Zephaniah is using the term **nose** to mean anger. He is doing this by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, in your translation you could use an expression involving that part of the body. You could also use plain language. Zephaniah is also speaking as if Yahweh’s **nose** or anger were literally **burning**. He means that Yahweh’s anger is very intense. Alternate translation: “so that Yahweh’s fierce anger does not come upon you” or “lest Yahweh’s fierce anger come upon you”
2:2	z061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בְּ⁠טֶ֣רֶם ׀ לֹא־יָב֣וֹא עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֗ם חֲרוֹן֙ אַף־יְהוָ֔ה	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if Yahweh’s **nose**, that is, his anger, were a living thing that could **come upon** the Judeans, that is, attack and overpower them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that Yahweh does not destroy you in his fierce anger” or “lest Yahweh destroy you in his fierce anger”
2:2	z062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	בְּ⁠טֶ֨רֶם֙ לֹא־יָב֣וֹא עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֔ם י֖וֹם אַף־יְהוָֽה	1	See how you translated the similar expression just before this one, and see how you translated the term **day** earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “so that Yahweh does not destroy you in his anger at the time when he punishes people for their sins”
2:3	rm7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בַּקְּשׁ֤וּ אֶת־יְהוָה֙	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if he literally wanted the Judeans to **Seek** or look for Yahweh. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: “Pray to Yahweh for mercy”
2:3	z063		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	כָּל־עַנְוֵ֣י הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	Zephaniah is using the adjective **humble** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. While Zephaniah is speaking of these people in the third person, he is addressing them directly. Alternate translation: “all you humble people of the earth”
2:3	z064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־עַנְוֵ֣י הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	Here the term **earth** could mean: (1) the land of Judah, since Zephaniah is addressing a specific “nation,” the nation of Judah, in verses 1–3. Alternate translation: “all you humble people of the land” or “all you Judeans who are willing to humble yourselves” (2) the entire world, since that is what the term means in [1:18](../01/18.md). Alternate translation: “all you humble people in the world”
2:3	z065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִשְׁפָּט֖⁠וֹ פָּעָ֑לוּ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who do what he has said is just”
2:3	z066		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בַּקְּשׁוּ־צֶ֨דֶק֙ בַּקְּשׁ֣וּ עֲנָוָ֔ה	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if he literally wanted the Judeans to **Seek** or look for **righteousness** and **humility**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The meaning of this image is slightly different from its meaning in [1:6](../01/06.md) and in the first part of the verse. Alternate translation: “Practice righteousness. Cultivate humility”
2:3	rg17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בַּקְּשׁוּ־צֶ֨דֶק֙ בַּקְּשׁ֣וּ עֲנָוָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **righteousness** and **humility**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “Do what is right. Be humble”
2:3	s75g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּסָּ֣תְר֔וּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you will be able to hide”
2:3	z067		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּסָּ֣תְר֔וּ	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if the Judeans could literally **be hidden** somewhere where Yahweh could not find them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will be spared”
2:3	z068		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠י֖וֹם אַף־יְהוָֽה	1	See how you translated the similar expression at the end of the previous verse. Alternate translation: “at the time when Yahweh angrily punishes people”
2:4	dth6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	עַזָּה֙ עֲזוּבָ֣ה תִֽהְיֶ֔ה & וְ⁠עֶקְר֖וֹן תֵּעָקֵֽר	1	For poetic effect and emphasis, at the beginning and end of this verse Zephaniah uses verbs that echo the sound of the names of the cities he is describing. It may be possible for you to reproduce this effect in your translation.
2:4	f893		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עַזָּה֙ עֲזוּבָ֣ה תִֽהְיֶ֔ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the people who used to live in Gaza will abandon that city” or “no one will live in Gaza anymore”
2:4	z069		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אַשְׁקְל֖וֹן לִ⁠שְׁמָמָ֑ה	1	Zephaniah is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and Ashkelon will become a ruin”
2:4	z070		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַשְׁדּ֗וֹד & יְגָ֣רְשׁ֔וּ⁠הָ	1	Zephaniah is speaking of the city of **Ashdod** as if it were a woman who could be **expelled** from the home in which she was living. He is using the city to represent the people who live in the city. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they will expel the inhabitants of Ashdod”
2:4	z071		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַשְׁדּ֗וֹד & יְגָ֣רְשׁ֔וּ⁠הָ	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “the inhabitants of Ashdod will be expelled” or “an army will expel the inhabitants of Ashdod”
2:4	mi6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בַּֽ⁠צָּהֳרַ֨יִם֙	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if an army would literally expel the inhabitants of Ashdod at a specific time, **at noon**. He is likely using noon, the time when the sun is brightest in the sky, to mean “in broad daylight,” that is, as the result of an open attack by an overwhelming force. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in an open attack”
2:4	sb41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עֶקְר֖וֹן תֵּעָקֵֽר	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if the city of **Ekron** were literally a plant that could be **uprooted**, that is, pulled completely out of the ground, including its roots. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and Ekron will be completely destroyed”
2:4	z072		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠עֶקְר֖וֹן תֵּעָקֵֽר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and it will be as if Ekron were a plant that someone had pulled out by the roots” or “and an army will destroy Ekron”
2:5	p4be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	חֶ֥בֶל הַ⁠יָּ֖ם	1	Zephaniah is using this possessive form to describe a **region** that is along the coast of the **sea**. He means specifically the area along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea where the Philistines lived. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the seacoast”
2:5	z073		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּרֵתִ֑ים	1	The word **Kerethites** is another name for all or part of the people group also known as the **Philistines**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use the name Philistines here in order to show that Zephaniah is addressing one people group, not two. Alternate translation: “the Philistines”
2:5	z074		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דְּבַר־יְהוָ֣ה עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Zephaniah is using the term **word** to mean what Yahweh has said by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh has spoken a message against you”
2:5	pq8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֗ם כְּנַ֨עַן֙ אֶ֣רֶץ פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים	1	Zephaniah is speaking to something that he knows cannot hear him, the land of **Canaan**, in order to show in a strong way how he feels about the people who live there. If a speaker in your language would not do that, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is against you Philistines who live in the land of Canaan”
2:5	z075		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֗ם	1	The word **you** is plural here because Zephaniah is implicitly speaking to the Philistines who live in the land of **Canaan**. However, since he is addressing that land directly, if you retain the direct-address form in your translation, it may be more natural in your language to use a singular form of “you.” (That would match the singular form of **you** in the quotation from Yahweh, “And I will destroy you,” which addresses Canaan as if that land were a person.)
2:5	z076		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וְ⁠הַאֲבַדְתִּ֖י⁠ךְ מֵ⁠אֵ֥ין יוֹשֵֽׁב	1	It may be more natural in your language to make this an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “He has said that he will destroy you until there is no inhabitant”
2:5	w9gq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	וְ⁠הַאֲבַדְתִּ֖י⁠ךְ מֵ⁠אֵ֥ין יוֹשֵֽׁב	1	As Zephaniah did, Yahweh is speaking to something that he knows cannot hear him, the land of **Canaan**, in order to show in a strong way how he feels about the people who live there. If a speaker in your language would not do that, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And I will destroy you Philistines until none of you live in the land of Canaan any more”
2:6	z077		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	חֶ֣בֶל הַ⁠יָּ֗ם	1	See how you translated this expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the seacoast” or “the seacoast where the Philistines formerly lived”
2:6	gm12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	נְוֺ֛ת כְּרֹ֥ת רֹעִ֖ים וְ⁠גִדְר֥וֹת צֹֽאן	1	Zephaniah is using these possessive forms to describe what will be in the **pastures**, who will use the **meadows**, and what the **pens** will contain. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “pastures in which there are meadows where shepherds graze their sheep and pens that hold their flocks”
2:7	h1ww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָ֖ה	1	Zephaniah is using the word **house** to mean the people who live in the kingdom of Judah. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people of Judah”
2:7	e8k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠בָתֵּ֣י אַשְׁקְל֗וֹן בָּ⁠עֶ֨רֶב֙ יִרְבָּצ֔וּ⁠ן	1	Zephaniah is using one aspect of living in a house, lying down there in the evening (that is, sleeping there at night) to mean living there in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they will come and live in the abandoned houses in the city of Ashkelon”
2:7	z078		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִפְקְדֵ֛⁠ם	1	Zephaniah is using the term **visit** in a specific sense to mean taking action in regard to someone. In [1:8](../01/08.md), [1:9](../01/09.md), and [1:12](../01/12.md), the term describes taking action to punish people. But here it describes taking action to help people. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will help them”
2:8	ep73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	שָׁמַ֨עְתִּי֙ חֶרְפַּ֣ת	1	This is the beginning of a direct quotation from Yahweh, as the phrase “the declaration of Yahweh of armies, the God of Israel” in the next verse indicates. See how you translated the phrase “the declaration of Yahweh” in [1:2](../01/02.md). If you used it to introduce the quotation there, you may wish to use the comparable phrase from [2:9](../02/09.md) to introduce the quotation here. The UST models a way to do that.
2:8	z079		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מוֹאָ֔ב	1	Yahweh is speaking of the country of **Moab** as if it were a living thing that could have expressed **reproach** against the people of Judah. He is referring to the people of that country. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people of Moab” or “the Moabites”
2:8	z080		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י עַמּ֑וֹן	1	Here the word **sons** means “descendants.” Yahweh is describing the members of the Ammonite people group by reference to their common descent from a single ancestor, Benammi, here called **Ammon**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people of Ammon” or “the Ammonites”
2:8	zd77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּגְדִּ֖ילוּ עַל־גְּבוּלָֽ⁠ם	1	This could mean: (1) that the Moabites and Ammonites have expanded their territories by taking territory away from the kingdom of Judah. Alternate translation: “and have stolen bordering territories from them” (2) that the Moabites and Ammonites have threatened to attack the kingdom of Judah and take some or all of its territory. Alternate translation: “and have boasted that they will take their territory”
2:9	hzr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	לָ⁠כֵ֣ן חַי־אָ֡נִי & כִּֽי	1	Yahweh is using this language to swear a solemn oath. He is indicating that the things he says will happen to Moab and Ammon are just as certain as some other very certain thing, the fact that he is **alive**. Translate this in a way that will show your readers that it is an oath. For example, it may be helpful to add the words **I swear**, as the UST does. If oaths are unfamiliar in your culture, you could also add a short explanation of what an oath is.
2:9	pi3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	נְאֻם֩ יְהוָ֨ה צְבָא֜וֹת אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	This phrase indicates that the rest of the material in verses 2:8–9 is a direct quotation from Yahweh. See how you decided to introduce this direct quotation in the previous verse.
2:9	z081		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יְהוָ֨ה צְבָא֜וֹת	1	The phrase **Yahweh of Armies** is a title for God that indicates his great power. It describes him as the commander of heavenly armies. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, it may have a particular way of translating this phrase, and you may wish to use that in your translation. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, express the meaning of this phrase in a way that will be clear to your readers. Alternate translation: “Yahweh the Almighty”
2:9	b2lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	מוֹאָ֞ב כִּ⁠סְדֹ֤ם תִּֽהְיֶה֙ וּ⁠בְנֵ֤י עַמּוֹן֙ כַּֽ⁠עֲמֹרָ֔ה	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **Sodom** and **Gomorrah** were completely destroyed (see [Genesis 19:1–29](../gen/19/01.md)), so the countries of **Moab** and **Ammon** will be completely destroyed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. See how you translated the word “Moab” and the expression “the sons of Ammon” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the country of Moab will be completely destroyed, as the city of Sodom was, and the people of Ammon will be completely destroyed, as the people of the city of Gomorrah were”
2:9	z082		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מִמְשַׁ֥ק חָר֛וּל וּ⁠מִכְרֵה־מֶ֥לַח וּ⁠שְׁמָמָ֖ה עַד־עוֹלָ֑ם	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They will become a possession of the nettle and the pit of salt and a ruin forever”
2:9	z083		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מִמְשַׁ֥ק חָר֛וּל וּ⁠מִכְרֵה־מֶ֥לַח וּ⁠שְׁמָמָ֖ה עַד־עוֹלָ֑ם	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **nettle** or **pit of salt**. He means nettles and salt pits in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “a possession of nettles and salt pits and a ruin forever”
2:9	l2f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִמְשַׁ֥ק חָר֛וּל וּ⁠מִכְרֵה־מֶ֥לַח וּ⁠שְׁמָמָ֖ה עַד־עוֹלָ֑ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if nettles and salt pits would literally own or possess the territory where the Moabites and Ammonites formerly lived. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a place where only weeds grow and where people dig for salt and where no one will ever build any buildings again”
2:9	dr9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	שְׁאֵרִ֤ית עַמִּ⁠י֙ יְבָזּ֔וּ⁠ם וְ⁠יֶ֥תֶר גּוֹיִ֖י יִנְחָלֽוּ⁠ם	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The remnant of my people will plunder them; indeed, the remainder of my nation will occupy them”
2:10	z084		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	זֹ֥את לָ⁠הֶ֖ם תַּ֣חַת גְּאוֹנָ֑⁠ם כִּ֤י חֵֽרְפוּ֙ וַ⁠יַּגְדִּ֔לוּ עַל־עַ֖ם יְהוָ֥ה צְבָאֽוֹת	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because they reproached and made themselves great against the people of Yahweh of Armies, this will be to them instead of their pride”
2:10	z085		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זֹ֥את לָ⁠הֶ֖ם תַּ֣חַת גְּאוֹנָ֑⁠ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **pride** of the Moabites and Ammonites were literally an object that belonged to them. He is also speaking as if the destruction they are going to experience were also an object and as if he were going to take away their pride and give them destruction in its place. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This will happen to them because they were so proud”
2:10	z086		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּגְדִּ֔לוּ עַל	1	See how you translated the expression “made themselves great” in [2:8](../02/08.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and stole bordering territories from” or “and boasted that they would take territory from”
2:10	z087		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יְהוָ֥ה צְבָאֽוֹת	1	See how you translated the title “Yahweh of Armies” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Yahweh the Almighty”
2:11	z088		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רָזָ֔ה אֵ֖ת כָּל־אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if Yahweh is literally going to **starve** the false **gods** that other nations worship, that is, deny them food so that they become thin. This is likely a reference to the fat of animals that people sacrificed to gods. The implication is that people will no longer sacrifice to those gods because they will no longer worship them once Yahweh has shown that he is the only true and powerful God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will show by his powerful actions that he is the only true God”
2:11	z089		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠יִשְׁתַּֽחֲווּ־ל⁠וֹ֙ & כֹּ֖ל אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠גּוֹיִֽם	1	Zephaniah is using this possessive form not to describe **islands** that belong to **nations** but to describe island-nations among the nations. The term **islands** can describe not just land that is completely surrounded by water but also land along a seacoast. In Zephaniah’s culture, people used the term to refer to distant lands. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And even the most distant nations will bow down to him”
2:11	z090		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠יִשְׁתַּֽחֲווּ־ל⁠וֹ֙ & כֹּ֖ל אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠גּוֹיִֽם	1	Zephaniah is speaking of the **nations** of the world as if they were living things that could **bow down** to Yahweh. He means that the people of the nations will do this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the people of even the most distant nations will bow down to him”
2:11	z091		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֣ישׁ מִ⁠מְּקוֹמ֔⁠וֹ	1	The phrase **a man** refers to an individual. In this context it could mean an individual nation or an individual person. If you retain Zephaniah’s depiction of the nations as living things, in your translation you could say “each in its own territory.” If you choose to show that he is using the nations to represent their people, you could say “all of them in their own territories.”
2:12	z092		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	גַּם־אַתֶּ֣ם כּוּשִׁ֔ים	1	This verse is a direct quotation from Yahweh. You may wish to indicate that in your translation by using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “Yahweh also declares, ‘You, Cushites’”
2:12	z093		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	חַֽלְלֵ֥י חַרְבִּ֖⁠י הֵֽמָּה	1	Yahweh is speaking about the Cushites in the third person, but since he is addressing them directly, it may be more natural in your language to translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “you will be pierced by my sword”
2:12	k6vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	חַֽלְלֵ֥י חַרְבִּ֖⁠י הֵֽמָּה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “my sword will pierce you”
2:12	dr9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חַֽלְלֵ֥י חַרְבִּ֖⁠י הֵֽמָּה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he were literally going to pierce or kill the Cushites with a **sword**. He means that he is going to cause an enemy army to kill many of them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “an enemy army will kill many of you”
2:13	vj6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠יֵ֤ט יָד⁠וֹ֙ עַל־צָפ֔וֹן וִֽ⁠יאַבֵּ֖ד אֶת־אַשּׁ֑וּר	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. You may wish to include both phrases in your translation, but it may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “And he will stretch out his hand against the north; yes, he will destroy Assyria”
2:13	rqc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠יֵ֤ט יָד⁠וֹ֙	1	See how you translated the expression “I will stretch out my hand” in [1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: “And he will use his power”
2:13	z094		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	צָפ֔וֹן	1	Zephaniah is using the term **north** by association to mean the empire that was located to the north of Judah, **Assyria**, as he indicates later in a parallel phrase. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the empire that is north of here”
2:14	z095		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְ⁠תוֹכָ֤⁠הּ	1	The possessive pronoun **its** refers to the city of Nineveh. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “in the midst of Nineveh”
2:14	fgc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	כָּל־חַיְת⁠וֹ־ג֔וֹי	1	Zephaniah is not referring to a specific **nation**. He means nations in general. He is also saying **every** as a generalization for emphasis. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They will be various kinds of herds, composed of the sorts of animals found in many different nations”
2:14	rq3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	גַּם־קָאַת֙ גַּם־קִפֹּ֔ד	1	Zephaniah is not referring to a specific **desert owl** or **screech owl**. He means many individual birds of these types. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Zephaniah may also be using these two types of desert bird to mean desert birds in general. Alternate translation: “Both desert owls and screech owls” or “Various desert birds”
2:14	jp3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠כַפְתֹּרֶ֖י⁠הָ יָלִ֑ינוּ	1	The word translated **columns** refers specifically to the tops of columns, which often had ornate decorations. The implication is that an army will have destroyed the elaborate buildings of Nineveh so that only columns remain standing, and they are not supporting a roof, so their tops are exposed and provide a roosting place for birds. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will roost on top of the exposed columns of its destroyed buildings”
2:14	e998		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ק֠וֹל יְשׁוֹרֵ֤ר בַּֽ⁠חַלּוֹן֙ חֹ֣רֶב בַּ⁠סַּ֔ף כִּ֥י אַרְזָ֖ה עֵרָֽה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Zephaniah is describing how badly Nineveh will be destroyed by referring to the fact that the costly and elaborate **cedar-work** of its ornate buildings will be exposed to the elements. Alternate translation: “Because the city will be destroyed so thoroughly that the cedar-work will be bare, a call will hoot in the window; devastation will be in the threshold”
2:14	u3vb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ק֠וֹל יְשׁוֹרֵ֤ר בַּֽ⁠חַלּוֹן֙	1	Zephaniah is speaking of a bird’s **call** as if it were a living thing that could **hoot** on its own. He is using the call of birds to represent the birds themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Birds will hoot their calls in the windows”
2:14	z096		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	חֹ֣רֶב בַּ⁠סַּ֔ף	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **devastation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “debris will block doorways”
2:15	kl78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	זֹ֞֠את הָ⁠עִ֤יר הָ⁠עַלִּיזָה֙ הַ⁠יּוֹשֶׁ֣בֶת לָ⁠בֶ֔טַח הָ⁠אֹֽמְרָה֙ בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠הּ אֲנִ֖י וְ⁠אַפְסִ֣⁠י ע֑וֹד	1	Zephaniah is speaking of the **city** of Nineveh as if it were a living thing that could exult, dwell in **security**, and speak. He means that the people of Nineveh have done these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is the city whose people exulted, who thought they dwelled in security, who said in their hearts, ‘We are, and besides us there are no others.’”
2:15	pvv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠אֹֽמְרָה֙ בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠הּ אֲנִ֖י וְ⁠אַפְסִ֣⁠י ע֑וֹד	1	Here the **heart** represents the thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one saying in its thoughts, ‘I am, and besides me there is not another’” or “the one saying to itself, ‘I am, and besides me there it not another’”
2:15	g214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הָ⁠אֹֽמְרָה֙ בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠הּ אֲנִ֖י וְ⁠אַפְסִ֣⁠י ע֑וֹד	1	In this context, the quoted statement means, “I am the only city that really matters; it is as if all other cities did not even exist.” You could say that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers.
2:15	z097		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	הָ⁠אֹֽמְרָה֙ בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֔⁠הּ אֲנִ֖י וְ⁠אַפְסִ֣⁠י ע֑וֹד	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “The one saying to itself that it is the only city that really matters, as if all other cities did not even exist” or “The one whose people said to themselves that their city was the only one that really mattered, as if all other cities did not even exist”
2:15	w3q5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	אֵ֣יךְ ׀ הָיְתָ֣ה לְ⁠שַׁמָּ֗ה	1	Zephaniah is using the past tense in order to describe something that will happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “How it will become a ruin”
2:15	z098		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מַרְבֵּץ֙ לַֽ⁠חַיָּ֔ה	1	Zephaniah is not referring to a specific **beast**. He means beasts in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “a lair for beasts”
2:15	n4jw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	כֹּ֚ל עוֹבֵ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ יִשְׁרֹ֖ק יָנִ֥יעַ יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	Hissing and shaking a **fist** at Nineveh would be symbolic actions that expressed contempt for the city. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of these actions. Alternate translation: “Every one passing by will hiss at it in contempt; he will shake his fist in scorn”
3:intro	f3en				0	# Zephaniah 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is the third of the three major parts of the book of Zephaniah. (See the outline in the General Introduction to the book.) This part begins with a warning to the city of Jerusalem (verses 1–8), and it then describes how Yahweh will restore Jerusalem and bring people from many nations there to worship him (verses 9–20).\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn verses 1–5, Zephaniah speaks of the city of Jerusalem as if it were a person who was acting in certain ways. Zephaniah is actually addressing the people of Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. For example, for the statement “Woe to the one rebelling” in verse 1, you might say “Woe to the people of Jerusalem, who are rebelling.”\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Gender of the pronoun for a city\n\nIn verses 1–5, Zephaniah uses the pronouns “she” and “her” to mean Jerusalem, since it was conventional in his language to use feminine pronouns when speaking about a city. In verses 11–12 and 18–19, Yahweh addresses the city as if it were a person, and he uses the feminine singular form of “you.” Zephaniah does the same in verses 14–15, as do the people who speak to Jerusalem in verses 16–17. If you decide to show in your translation that all of these speakers are addressing Jerusalem as if the city were a person, you may decide to use the gender of pronoun that is conventional in your own language.\n\n### Number of pronouns\n\nThe pronoun “you” is singular throughout the chapter except for in v. 20, where it is plural. Use the corresponding forms in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you” and if you decide to retain the references to the city of Jerusalem as if it were a person.
3:1	aew2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ה֥וֹי מֹרְאָ֖ה וְ⁠נִגְאָלָ֑ה הָ⁠עִ֖יר הַ⁠יּוֹנָֽה	1	Zephaniah is implicitly referring to the **city** of Jerusalem. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Woe to Jerusalem, the one rebelling and being defiled, the oppressing city”
3:1	d7qu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מֹרְאָ֖ה וְ⁠נִגְאָלָ֑ה הָ⁠עִ֖יר הַ⁠יּוֹנָֽה	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here and through verse 5, Zephaniah is speaking of the **city** of Jerusalem as if it were a person who could be **rebelling** and who could have become **defiled** and who could be **oppressing** vulnerable people. Zephaniah is actually addressing the people of Jerusalem who have been doing these things. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation, here and in verses 2–5. Alternate translation: “you people of Jerusalem who are rebelling against Yahweh and who have become defiled and who are oppressing others”
3:1	fc2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֹרְאָ֖ה וְ⁠נִגְאָלָ֑ה הָ⁠עִ֖יר הַ⁠יּוֹנָֽה	1	If your language does not use a passive form such as **being defiled**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the city that has rebelled and defiled herself and that has oppressed people” or “you people of Jerusalem who are rebelling against Yahweh and who have defiled yourselves and who are oppressing others”
3:1	z099		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מֹרְאָ֖ה וְ⁠נִגְאָלָ֑ה	1	In verses 1­–7, as the ULT shows, Zephaniah uses feminine singular pronouns to refer to the city of Jerusalem. That was conventional in his language. Your language may use a different gender of pronouns to refer to cities. If you translate verses 1–7 as though Zephaniah is speaking directly to the city as a person, use the gender of pronoun that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the city that has rebelled and defiled itself”
3:2	lb6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹ֤א שָֽׁמְעָה֙ בְּ⁠ק֔וֹל	1	Zephaniah is using the term **heard** in a specific sense to mean “obeyed.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “She does not obey the voice”
3:2	z100		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֤א שָֽׁמְעָה֙ בְּ⁠ק֔וֹל	1	The term **voice** could mean: (1) the voice of Yahweh, that is, the message Yahweh has been sending to the people of Jerusalem through his prophets telling the people to repent. Alternate translation: “She has not obeyed Yahweh’s command to repent” (2) the voice of anyone who has been warning the people of the city that their wicked behavior will have destructive consequences. Alternate translation: “She does not listen to anyone who tries to warn her”
3:2	z101		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶל־אֱלֹהֶ֖י⁠הָ לֹ֥א קָרֵֽבָה	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if the city of Jerusalem, meaning its people, could literally have **drawn near** to **God**, that is, moved closer to a place where God was. He means that they could have and should have worshiped God sincerely. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “she does not worship her God sincerely”
3:3	z102		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שָׂרֶ֣י⁠הָ	1	See how you translated the term “princes” in [1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: “her officials”
3:3	ae1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְ⁠קִרְבָּ֔⁠הּ אֲרָי֖וֹת שֹֽׁאֲגִ֑ים	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if the **princes** of Jerusalem were literally **roaring lions**. He means that they exploit and harm vulnerable people rather than protecting them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. You may find it helpful to translate this image as a comparison. Alternate translation: “exploit and harm the vulnerable people of the city, as if they were roaring lions attacking their prey”
3:3	z5i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זְאֵ֣בֵי עֶ֔רֶב	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if the **judges** of Jerusalem were literally **wolves**. As in the case of his comparison of the city’s princes to lions, he means that they exploit and harm vulnerable people rather than protecting them. By **wolves of the evening**, Zephaniah means wolves that have not eaten all day and so are especially aggressive from hunger. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Once again you may find it helpful to translate this image as a comparison. Alternate translation: “also exploit and harm the vulnerable people of the city, like hungry wolves attacking their prey”
3:3	z103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֥א גָרְמ֖וּ לַ⁠בֹּֽקֶר	1	Zephaniah is continuing to speak of the city’s **judges** as if they were **wolves**. The last thing a wolf would do in eating an animal it had killed, after consuming its flesh, would be to **gnaw** on its bones to get at the marrow inside. Zephaniah is saying that these judges are like wolves that eat an entire animal at once when they kill it in the evening or at night, leaving not even this final task for the morning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they take everything away from vulnerable people”
3:4	u7tc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פֹּֽחֲזִ֔ים	1	Zephaniah is speaking as if the **prophets** in Jerusalem were literally **light**, that is, as if they did not weigh very much. He could mean: (1) that they are frivolous in character and so what they say is not profound or significant. Alternate translation: “are frivolous” (2) that nothing restrains them from doing wrong things, as if they were a light object with nothing weighing it down that would float away or be blown away. Alternate translation: “are unprincipled” or “are reckless”
3:4	z104		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	אַנְשֵׁ֖י בֹּֽגְד֑וֹת	1	The phrase **men of treacheries** gives further information about the **prophets** whom Zephaniah is describing. It does not refer to a different group of people. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They are men of treacheries”
3:4	xm2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אַנְשֵׁ֖י בֹּֽגְד֑וֹת	1	Zephaniah is using this possessive form not to describe men who belong to treacheries but to describe **men** who habitually commit **treacheries**. This could mean: (1) that these prophets deceive and betray other people in order to take advantage of them. Alternate translation: “They treat others treacherously” (2) that they are not faithful to Yahweh, that is, they do not speak only messages that Yahweh has given them. Rather, they speak messages that they claim are from Yahweh but which Yahweh has not given them. Alternate translation: “They do not speak faithfully only what Yahweh has told them”
3:4	q96w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חִלְּלוּ־קֹ֔דֶשׁ	1	Zephaniah is using the adjective **holy** as a noun to mean a certain thing or kind of thing. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. The word **holy** could be referring to: (1) the temple, as a holy place set apart for the worship of Yahweh. Alternate translation: “treat the temple as if it were just an ordinary place” (2) in addition to the temple, all of the clothing, equipment, and food that was set apart for the use of the priests in leading the people in the worship of Yahweh. Alternate translation: “treat the special things that they are supposed to use in worship as if they were ordinary things”
3:5	a3p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֥א יַעֲשֶׂ֖ה עַוְלָ֑ה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative word **unrighteousness**. Alternate translation: “He always does what is right”
3:5	z105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בַּ⁠בֹּ֨קֶר בַּ⁠בֹּ֜קֶר מִשְׁפָּט֨⁠וֹ יִתֵּ֤ן לָ⁠אוֹר֙ לֹ֣א נֶעְדָּ֔ר	1	The word **light** could mean: (1) the light of dawn. In that case, Zephaniah would be saying the same thing twice in slightly different ways for emphasis. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition. To reflect this, you may wish to include both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If you do that, it may be helpful to add a connecting word in order to show that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “In the morning, in the morning he gives his justice; indeed, at dawn he is not left out” (2) visibility, representing how Yahweh makes **justice** evident. In that case, the phrase **at light** would apply to the first clause rather than to the second one. Alternate translation: “In the morning, in the morning he brings his justice to light; he is not left out” or “In the morning, in the morning he makes his justice evident; indeed, he does not fail to do that”
3:5	fe75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	בַּ⁠בֹּ֨קֶר בַּ⁠בֹּ֜קֶר	1	Zephaniah is repeating the phrase **In the morning** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat phrases for intensification, you may find it appropriate to do that here in your translation. Your language may also have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Morning by morning” or “Every morning”
3:5	z106		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠בֹּ֨קֶר בַּ⁠בֹּ֜קֶר	1	Zephaniah is using the term **morning** to mean a day, by association with the way that each day begins with a morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Day by day” or “Every day”
3:5	cvu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מִשְׁפָּט֨⁠וֹ יִתֵּ֤ן	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he tells people how to act justly” or “he declares what would be the just thing to do”
3:5	z107		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לֹ֣א נֶעְדָּ֔ר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he is not missing” or “he does not fail to appear”
3:5	dm1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֣א נֶעְדָּ֔ר	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **left out**. The double negative expresses emphasis, and you may choose to express that emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “he diligently appears”
3:5	z108		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יוֹדֵ֥עַ עַוָּ֖ל בֹּֽשֶׁת	1	Zephaniah is using the adjective **unrighteous** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Yet people who are unrighteous do not know shame”
3:5	dwk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יוֹדֵ֥עַ עַוָּ֖ל בֹּֽשֶׁת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **shame**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Yet people who are unrighteous are not ashamed of what they do, even though they should be”
3:6	t3em		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	הִכְרַ֣תִּי גוֹיִ֗ם נָשַׁ֨מּוּ֙ פִּנּוֹתָ֔⁠ם הֶחֱרַ֥בְתִּי חֽוּצוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	This is the beginning of a direct quotation from Yahweh that continues through verse 13. You may wish to indicate that in your translation by using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “Yahweh has said, ‘I have cut off nations, their corners have been demolished; I have destroyed their streets’”
3:6	ie5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִכְרַ֣תִּי גוֹיִ֗ם נָשַׁ֨מּוּ֙ פִּנּוֹתָ֔⁠ם הֶחֱרַ֥בְתִּי חֽוּצוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he has done these things personally, but he means that the enemy army he has been describing throughout the book has done them. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have caused an enemy army to cut off nations, their corners have been demolished; that army has destroyed their streets”
3:6	z109		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִכְרַ֣תִּי	1	See how you translated the expression “cut off” in [1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: “I have destroyed” or “I have caused an enemy army to destroy”
3:6	z110		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נָשַׁ֨מּוּ֙ פִּנּוֹתָ֔⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I have demolished their corners” or “it has demolished their corners”
3:6	z111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פִּנּוֹתָ֔⁠ם	1	See how you translated the word **corners** in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “the high towers at the corners of their walls”
3:6	y9qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִצְדּ֧וּ עָרֵי⁠הֶ֛ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Their cities are in ruins”
3:6	asi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	מִ⁠בְּלִי־אִ֖ישׁ מֵ⁠אֵ֥ין יוֹשֵֽׁב	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Yahweh is using them together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “without a single person living there”
3:7	z112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אָמַ֜רְתִּי אַךְ־תִּירְאִ֤י אוֹתִ⁠י֙ תִּקְחִ֣י מוּסָ֔ר וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִכָּרֵ֣ת מְעוֹנָ֔⁠הּ כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־פָּקַ֖דְתִּי עָלֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	In this quotation, Yahweh first speaks directly to the city of Jerusalem in the second person, and then he speaks about that city in the third person. If it would help your readers appreciate what Yahweh is saying, you could translate the entire quotation in the third person. Alternate translation: “I said, ‘Surely she will fear me; she will take correction. Then her dwelling will not be cut off {by} all that I have visited upon her.’”
3:7	mvv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אָמַ֜רְתִּי אַךְ־תִּירְאִ֤י אוֹתִ⁠י֙ תִּקְחִ֣י מוּסָ֔ר וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִכָּרֵ֣ת מְעוֹנָ֔⁠הּ כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־פָּקַ֖דְתִּי עָלֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I said that she would surely fear me; she would take correction. Then her dwelling would not be cut off by all that I had visited upon her”
3:7	z113		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אָמַ֜רְתִּי אַךְ־תִּירְאִ֤י אוֹתִ⁠י֙ תִּקְחִ֣י מוּסָ֔ר וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִכָּרֵ֣ת מְעוֹנָ֔⁠הּ כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־פָּקַ֖דְתִּי עָלֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	Yahweh is speaking to and about the city of Jerusalem as if it were a person who could **fear** him and **take correction**. He is actually speaking to and about the people who live in Jerusalem. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See what you did in [3:1–5](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “I said that the people of Jerusalem would surely fear me; they would take correction. Then their dwelling would not be cut off by all that I had visited upon them”
3:7	g15j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־פָּקַ֖דְתִּי עָלֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	See how you translated the expression “visit upon” in [1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: “by all that I have done to punish her”
3:7	z114		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִשְׁכִּ֣ימוּ הִשְׁחִ֔יתוּ כֹּ֖ל עֲלִילוֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	Yahweh is using the expression **rose early** to mean that the people were eager to do corrupt things. The expression comes from the way that people get up early in the morning to do something if they are eager to do it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they eagerly corrupted all of their deeds”
3:7	u1c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	הִשְׁכִּ֣ימוּ הִשְׁחִ֔יתוּ כֹּ֖ל עֲלִילוֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	Yahweh says that as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “they eagerly corrupted their deeds even more”
3:8	rhe9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לָ⁠כֵ֤ן חַכּוּ־לִ⁠י֙ נְאֻם־יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠י֖וֹם קוּמִ֣⁠י לְ⁠עַ֑ד	1	See how you translated the phrase “the declaration of Yahweh” in [1:2](../01/02.md), [1:3](../01/03.md), [1:10](../01/10.md), and [2:9](../02/09.md). If you used it to introduce the quotations in those places, you may wish to do the same thing here. Alternate translation: “This is what Yahweh declares: ‘Therefore wait for me, for the day of my arising to the prey’”
3:8	my26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לָ⁠כֵ֤ן חַכּוּ־לִ⁠י֙ נְאֻם־יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠י֖וֹם קוּמִ֣⁠י לְ⁠עַ֑ד	1	The imperative **wait** is plural, so Yahweh is addressing some group of people. That group could be: (1) the wicked Judeans who are still disobeying Yahweh despite his warnings. In that case, Yahweh would be using the term **wait** to indicate that he is certainly going to do what he describes. Your language may use the term “wait” in this same sense. If not, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “‘Therefore, you sinful Judeans, just wait!’—the declaration of Yahweh—‘One day soon I will arise to the prey’” or “‘Therefore you can be certain, you sinful Judeans’—the declaration of Yahweh—‘that one day soon I will arise to the prey’” (2) the “humble of the earth” whom Zephaniah mentions in [2:3](../02/03.md). In that case, Yahweh would be using the term **wait** to tell them to be patient until he punishes sin and enforces justice. Alternate translation: “‘Therefore, be patient, you godly people’—the declaration of Yahweh—‘until the day when I arise to the prey’”
3:8	z115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠י֖וֹם קוּמִ֣⁠י	1	While Yahweh is going to punish sinful nations on a specific **day**, he is using that term here to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “until the time when I arise”
3:8	izp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠עַ֑ד	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he were a predatory animal and the wicked **nations** and **kingdoms** that he is going to punish were **prey** that he was going to pounce on. (This could be an allusion to the description of Jerusalem’s “princes” as “lions” and its “judges” as “wolves” in [3:3](../03/03.md), indicating that those who preyed on others will themselves become prey.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to punish wicked people”
3:8	mvx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠עַ֑ד	1	The phrase translated **to the prey** could also be translated **as a witness**. If that is the meaning, then Yahweh would be speaking as if he were literally going to stand up and give evidence that these kingdoms and nations had sinned wickedly against him. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “as if I were going testify against you”
3:8	z116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠שְׁפֹּ֨ךְ עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֤ם זַעְמִ⁠י֙	1	Yahweh is speaking as if his **indignation** were a liquid that he was going to **pour out** onto wicked nations and kingdoms. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to punish them in my indignation”
3:8	q1ml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	כֹּ֚ל חֲר֣וֹן אַפִּ֔⁠י	1	The phrase **all of the burning of my nose** is a further description of Yahweh’s **indignation**. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:2](../02/02.md). It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “My anger against them is very intense”
3:8	ge59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠אֵ֣שׁ קִנְאָתִ֔⁠י תֵּאָכֵ֖ל כָּל־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:18](../01/18.md). As the General Introduction to Zephaniah indicates, these parallel statements mark the boundaries between the major sections of the book. It may be helpful to your readers to translate them in the same way. Alternate translation: “I will destroy all of the people who live on the earth when I punish them in my jealousy”
3:9	la62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּֽי־& אֶהְפֹּ֥ךְ אֶל־עַמִּ֖ים שָׂפָ֣ה בְרוּרָ֑ה לִ⁠קְרֹ֤א כֻלָּ⁠ם֙ בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם יְהוָ֔ה	1	Yahweh is using the term **lip** by association to mean the capacity to speak. He could mean: (1) the peoples were saying wicked things because their character was wicked, but he will purify their character so that they will say pure things. Alternate translation: “I will surely give the peoples righteous character so that they will say pure things; then they will pray to me acceptably” (2) that by invoking the names of other gods (as described in [1:5](../01/05.md)), they had made themselves unworthy to pray to Yahweh, but he will cleanse their capacity to speak so that they can pray to him. Alternate translation: “I will surely cleanse the speech of the peoples from the defilement of the names of other gods so that they can pray to me acceptably”
3:9	z117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	כִּֽי & אֶהְפֹּ֥ךְ אֶל־עַמִּ֖ים שָׂפָ֣ה בְרוּרָ֑ה	1	Since Yahweh is speaking of many **peoples**, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **lip**. Alternate translation: “I will surely give the peoples pure lips”
3:9	k8y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠קְרֹ֤א כֻלָּ⁠ם֙ בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם יְהוָ֔ה	1	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. However, in this instance there is also the idea that the peoples will call upon Yahweh (that is, pray to him) by name, acknowledging him as God. Alternate translation: “for all of them to pray to Yahweh by name”
3:9	z118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠עָבְד֖⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “upon my name, to serve me”
3:9	f339		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שְׁכֶ֥ם אֶחָֽד	1	Yahweh is using this expression to mean that the peoples will serve him unitedly, as if they were all putting their shoulders together to lift or push something heavy. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “shoulder to shoulder” or “together”
3:10	zs4q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מֵ⁠עֵ֖בֶר לְ⁠נַֽהֲרֵי־כ֑וּשׁ	1	Yahweh is using one distant place, the area around the **rivers of Cush** (the upper Nile region), to mean distant places in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “From even as far away as across the rivers of Cush” or “From even the most distant places”
3:10	z119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בַּת־פוּצַ֔⁠י	1	Here the expression **daughter of** describes the people who make up a certain group. The group in view here is the Jewish nation that will have been **scattered** into many different places through exile. Alternate translation: “the people of my scattered nation”
3:10	z120		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בַּת־פוּצַ֔⁠י	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people, whom conquering empires will have scattered into many lands”
3:10	z121		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יוֹבִל֖וּ⁠ן מִנְחָתִֽ⁠י	1	Since Yahweh is speaking of what many people will **bring**, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **offering**. Alternate translation: “will bring my offerings” or “will bring offerings to me”
3:11	xcx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לֹ֤א תֵב֨וֹשִׁי֙ & עֲלִילֹתַ֔יִ⁠ךְ	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse because Yahweh is speaking to the city of Jerusalem as if it were a person, as he did in [3:7](../03/07.md). Since Yahweh is actually speaking to the people who live in Jerusalem, you could use the plural forms of “you” and “your” in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
3:11	y6pj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	עַלִּיזֵי֙ גַּאֲוָתֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	Yahweh is using this possessive form to describe **exultant** or boastful people in the city of Jerusalem who are characterized by pride. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the people who have been boasting so proudly”
3:12	z122		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בְ⁠קִרְבֵּ֔⁠ךְ	1	See whether you decided to use the singular or plural form of “you” and “your” in the previous verse. It would be helpful to use the same form here.
3:12	z123		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	עַ֥ם עָנִ֖י וָ⁠דָ֑ל	1	The terms **humble** and **lowly** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “a genuinely humble people”
3:12	z124		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠חָס֖וּ בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥ם יְהוָֽה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “and they will trust in my name”
3:12	c1gc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠חָס֖וּ בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥ם יְהוָֽה	1	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “and they will trust in me personally”
3:13	y163		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠לֹא־יְדַבְּר֣וּ כָזָ֔ב וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִמָּצֵ֥א בְּ⁠פִי⁠הֶ֖ם לְשׁ֣וֹן תַּרְמִ֑ית	1	and they will not speak a lie, and a tongue of deceit will not be found in their mouth Since Yahweh is speaking of many people, it may be more natural in your language to use plural forms here. Alternate translation: “and they will not speak lies, and tongues of deceit will not be found in their mouths”
3:13	b2m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠לֹא־יְדַבְּר֣וּ כָזָ֔ב וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִמָּצֵ֥א בְּ⁠פִי⁠הֶ֖ם לְשׁ֣וֹן תַּרְמִ֑ית	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. You may wish to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation but connecting them with a word other than **and**. Alternate translation: “and they will not speak lies; no, tongues of deceit will not be found in their mouths”
3:13	ja4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִמָּצֵ֥א בְּ⁠פִי⁠הֶ֖ם לְשׁ֣וֹן תַּרְמִ֑ית	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and no one will find deceitful tongues in their mouths”
3:13	z125		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִמָּצֵ֥א בְּ⁠פִי⁠הֶ֖ם לְשׁ֣וֹן תַּרְמִ֑ית	1	Here the word **found** indicates that something will not be able to be found because it will not be there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and there will be not be any deceitful tongues in their mouths”
3:13	z126		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִמָּצֵ֥א בְּ⁠פִי⁠הֶ֖ם לְשׁ֣וֹן תַּרְמִ֑ית	1	Yahweh is using the terms **tongue** and **mouth** by association to mean speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they will not say any deceitful things”
3:13	z127		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי־הֵ֛מָּה יִרְע֥וּ וְ⁠רָבְצ֖וּ וְ⁠אֵ֥ין מַחֲרִֽיד	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “And since no one will frighten them, they will be able to graze and lie down”
3:13	pe7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּֽי־הֵ֛מָּה יִרְע֥וּ וְ⁠רָבְצ֖וּ וְ⁠אֵ֥ין מַחֲרִֽיד	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the people in the remnant of Israel will be animals that will **graze** and **lie down** in pastures. He means that they will be able to live peacefully, like animals grazing undisturbed out in a field. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But they will be able to live without anyone disturbing them”
3:14	z128		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	רָנִּי֙ & הָרִ֖יעוּ & שִׂמְחִ֤י וְ⁠עָלְזִי֙	1	The implied “you” in the imperatives **Sing**, **Rejoice**, and **exult** is singular because Zephaniah is addressing a group as if it were a single individual. The implied “you” in the imperative **Shout** is plural because Zephaniah is addressing a group as a number of individuals. Use the same singular and plural forms in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you” and you decide to retain the singular and plural forms of address. However, see the notes to the rest of this verse, which suggest the possibility of using a plural address throughout the verse.
3:14	d6q3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בַּת־צִיּ֔וֹן	1	See how you translated the expression **daughter of** in [3:10](../03/10.md). Here as well it describes the people who make up a certain group. Alternate translation: “you people of Zion”
3:14	z129		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בַּת־צִיּ֔וֹן	1	The word **Zion** is the name of the mountain on which the city of Jerusalem was located. Zephaniah is using the name by association to represent the entire kingdom of Judah, whose capital was Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “you people of Judah”
3:14	z130		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Zephaniah is addressing many people by the name of their nation, **Israel**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you people of Israel”
3:14	x7wg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	שִׂמְחִ֤י וְ⁠עָלְזִי֙	1	The terms **Rejoice** and **exult** mean similar things. Zephaniah is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Rejoice greatly”
3:14	qj83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠כָל־לֵ֔ב	1	Here the **heart** represents the feelings. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “with deep emotion”
3:14	z131		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בַּ֖ת יְרוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	See how you translated the expression **daughter of** earlier in this verse. Alternate translation: “you people of Jerusalem”
3:15	t4fy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מִשְׁפָּטַ֔יִ⁠ךְ & לֹא־תִֽירְאִ֥י	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the words “you” and “your” are singular in these instances and generally in verses 16–19 because they are addressing Jerusalem as an individual. If you decide to retain the singular address, use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction, but use plural forms if you decide to have a plural address.
3:15	lb51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מִשְׁפָּטַ֔יִ⁠ךְ	1	Zephaniah is using this possessive form not to describe **judgments** that the people of Jerusalem have made but to describe judgments that **Yahweh** has made against them. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “his judgments against you”
3:15	z132		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מֶ֣לֶךְ יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל	1	It is true in one sense that **Yahweh** is the **king** of the people of **Israel**. As their God, he is the ruler whom they must obey. But in another sense, he is not literally the king who rules from the palace in Jerusalem. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The ruler of Israel” or “The God whom the Israelites worship and obey”
3:16	v9ia		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֔וּא	1	Zephaniah is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “At that time”
3:16	z133		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יֵאָמֵ֥ר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Some languages might use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “they will say”
3:16	eh5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לִירֽוּשָׁלִַ֖ם אַל־תִּירָ֑אִי צִיּ֖וֹן אַל־יִרְפּ֥וּ יָדָֽיִ⁠ךְ	1	The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **Do not fear** are singular here because they are addressing **Zion** as an individual. However, the implied “you” in the imperative **Do not slacken** is plural because it envisions Zion as a group consisting of a number of individuals. You may have decided to use plural forms in verses 16–19. Alternate translation, using plural forms: “to the people of Jerusalem, ‘Do not fear, you people of Zion! None of you slacken your hands’”
3:16	pc5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַל־תִּירָ֑אִי צִיּ֖וֹן אַל־יִרְפּ֥וּ יָדָֽיִ⁠ךְ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. The people who are speaking to Zion are using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. (They are referring to the way that a person’s hands **slacken** or become limp when that person is afraid.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “There is no reason for you to become weak with fear, Zion”
3:17	h9ek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יַחֲרִישׁ֙ בְּ⁠אַ֣הֲבָת֔⁠וֹ	1	Since the people who are speaking to Jerusalem say that Yahweh will **rejoice** and **exult**, they do not mean that he will literally **be silent.** Rather, they mean that Yahweh will no longer speak words of condemnation and judgment against Jerusalem. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in his love, he will no longer speak to condemn you”
3:18	z134		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נוּגֵ֧י מִ⁠מּוֹעֵ֛ד אָסַ֖פְתִּי מִמֵּ֣⁠ךְ הָי֑וּ מַשְׂאֵ֥ת עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ חֶרְפָּֽה	1	This verse is very difficult to understand. Modern versions translate it in many different ways. The ULT offers one reasonable interpretation of it. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation that it expresses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation of ULT.
3:18	z136		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נוּגֵ֧י מִ⁠מּוֹעֵ֛ד אָסַ֖פְתִּי מִמֵּ֣⁠ךְ הָי֑וּ	1	Yahweh may be using one kind of worship, a **solemn assembly**, to mean worship in general. He is addressing the city of Jerusalem as if it were an individual, so the phrase **they are from you** may be clarifying that the people who are **grieving** are Judeans who have been taken into exile and who are sad because they can no longer participate in the worship of Yahweh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will bring back the Judeans who have been taken into exile, who are sad because they cannot take part in public worship of me”
3:18	z135		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אָסַ֖פְתִּי	1	This is the beginning of a direct quotation from Yahweh that continues through verse 20. You may wish to indicate that in your translation, using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “Yahweh says, ‘I will gather’”
3:18	i4ff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מַשְׂאֵ֥ת עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ חֶרְפָּֽה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **reproach** of being conquered were literally a **burden** or heavy weight that Jerusalem was carrying with difficulty. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it was painful for the people of Jerusalem to feel the disgrace of being conquered”
3:19	qc78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠הוֹשַׁעְתִּ֣י אֶת־הַ⁠צֹּלֵעָ֗ה וְ⁠הַ⁠נִּדָּחָה֙ אֲקַבֵּ֔ץ	1	The expressions **lame** and **cast-out one** are both feminine singular, suggesting that Yahweh is using both expressions to refer to Jerusalem as if that city were a female individual. In that case, Yahweh would be using repetition to emphasize the idea that these phrases express. The reference would actually be to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, who would be **lame** or limping from the difficulty of walking from their homeland to a place of exile and who could be described as **cast-out** since they had been taken from their homeland. It may be helpful to indicate in your translation that these two phrases are expressing the same idea. Alternate translation: “And I will rescue the people of Judah who are limping from walking so far away from home; yes, I will bring them back from exile”
3:19	kzw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֶת־הַ⁠צֹּלֵעָ֗ה	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **lame** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the lame people” or “the people of Judah who are limping from walking so far away from home”
3:19	z137		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הַ⁠נִּדָּחָה֙	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the exile” or “the people of Judah whose enemies have taken them into exile”
3:19	z138		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠שַׂמְתִּי⁠ם֙ לִ⁠תְהִלָּ֣ה וּ⁠לְ⁠שֵׁ֔ם בְּ⁠כָל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בָּשְׁתָּֽ⁠ם	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And I will turn them into praise, and I will turn their shame into a name in all of the earth.”
3:19	ry88		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שַׂמְתִּי⁠ם֙ לִ⁠תְהִלָּ֣ה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he were literally going to **turn** the people of Judah into **praise**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And I will cause people to praise them”
3:19	cxu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠לְ⁠שֵׁ֔ם בְּ⁠כָל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בָּשְׁתָּֽ⁠ם	1	Here, **name** represents the reputation of a group. Alternate translation: “and I will give them a good reputation throughout the earth instead of the shame that they now experience”
3:20	d2a1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אָבִ֣יא אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter indicate, the words **you** and **your** are plural in this verse. Yahweh is now addressing the people of Judah as a group of individuals. If you have been using singular and plural forms in your translation to show the different kinds of address in this chapter, you may wish to indicate explicitly that the address changes to plural here. Alternate translation: “I will bring in you people of Judah”
3:20	z139		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶתֵּ֨ן אֶתְ⁠כֶ֜ם לְ⁠שֵׁ֣ם וְ⁠לִ⁠תְהִלָּ֗ה בְּ⁠כֹל֙ עַמֵּ֣י הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	See how you translated term **name** in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “I will give you a good reputation among all of the peoples of the earth, and they will praise you”
3:20	z140		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠שׁוּבִ֧⁠י אֶת־שְׁבוּתֵי⁠כֶ֛ם לְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Yahweh is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You will personally witness me restoring your fortunes”
3:20	z141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אָמַ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1	Zephaniah is using this phrase to indicate that verses 18–20 have been a quotation of a message that Yahweh gave him for the people of Judah. (This phrase means the same thing as “the declaration of Yahweh,” which occurs several times in the book.) Consider natural ways of identifying direct quotations in your language. It may be more natural for you to put this attribution of the saying to Yahweh at the beginning of the message, that is, at the start of verse 18, as the UST does.
