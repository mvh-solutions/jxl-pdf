A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n3. Proverbs from Solomon (10:1–22:16)\n4. Sayings from wise men (22:17–24:22)\n5. More sayings from wise men (24:23–34)\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon (25:1–29:27)\n7. Sayings from Agur (30:1–33)\n8. Sayings from Lemuel (31:1–9)\n9. Description of a good and capable wife (31:10–31)\n\n### What is the book of Proverbs about?\n\nThe book of Proverbs is a collection of proverbs. A proverb is a saying that gives wise advice or teaches something that is generally true about life. Most societies have their own proverbs and may use specific language that indicates something is a proverb. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe title of this book is often translated as “Proverbs.” A more general translation would be “Sayings for Wise People,” “Wise Sayings,” or something similar.\n\n### Who wrote the book of Proverbs?\n\nProverbs begins with the words, “The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David and King of Israel.” However, Solomon did not write all of the proverbs in this book. Unnamed wise men wrote the proverbs in [22:17](../22/17.md)–[24:34](../24/34.md). Agur the son of Jakeh wrote the proverbs in [30:1–33](../30/01.md) and King Lemuel wrote the proverbs in [31:1–31](../31/01.md).\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is meant by “wisdom” and “foolishness” in the book of Proverbs?\n\n“Wisdom” refers to understanding and doing what is true and morally right. A wise person understands and does what Yahweh considers to be right. Anyone living in this way will also learn to live well with other people and to make good practical decisions in life. Those who fail to live in this way are called “foolish.” For this reason, it is possible for a person to be very intelligent and still be foolish. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])\n\n### My Son\n\nSeveral parts of Proverbs contain a series of proverbs addressed to “my son” or “sons” ([1:8](../01/08.md)–[9:18](../09/18.md); [19:27](../19/27.md); [23:15](../23/15.md)–[24:22](../24/22.md); [27:11](../27/11.md); [31:2](../31/02.md)–[31](../31/31.md)) This does not mean that all the lessons in those proverbs only apply to males. Rather, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son. Whenever the lesson of such proverbs is not specifically about common temptations of young men, the UST uses more general language that could refer to both male and female children. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Proverbs\n\nMost of this book consists of individual proverbs. A proverb is a short saying about something that is generally true in life. Proverbs often use parallelism and metaphors to teach a lesson by referring to something or some event that would be familiar to the readers. If possible, translate each proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])\n\n### Parallelism\n\nMany proverbs have two parts that have a relationship to each other. The second part may strengthen the first part, give more details about the first part, or say what seems to be the opposite of the first part. Translators should take into account that each proverb is also part of a larger group of proverbs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Personification\n\nIn Proverbs, certain qualities such as wisdom and stupidity are often represented as if they were human. [Proverbs 1:20–33](../01/20.md), [3:15–18](../03/15.md), [4:6–9](../04/06.md), and [8:1](../08/01.md)–[9:12](../09/12.md) refer to wisdom as if it were a woman. [Proverbs 9:13–18](../09/13.md) might also refer to stupidity as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent these qualities, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom or folly would be presented as being like a wise or stupid woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n\n### Generic Nouns\n\nProverbs contains many generic noun phrases that refer to people or things in general rather than to specific individuals or things. This type of nouns occur frequently in this book because proverbs tell about things that are true about people in general. Most of the cases of generic nouns will be addressed in the notes. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])\n
1:intro	y4et				0	# Proverbs 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction and purpose for Proverbs (1:1–7)\n    * Title (1:1)\n    * The purpose of Proverbs (1:2–6)\n    * Main theme: Fearing Yahweh is essential to being wise (1:7)\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [1:20–33](../01/20.md), wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator should translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

The second clause emphasizes the meaning of the first clause by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, so it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

3:intro	a94e				0	# Proverbs 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### My Son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [3:15–18](../03/15.md), wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator should translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “do not forget my law, yes, my commandments let your heart guard”
3:1	jvym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	אַל־תִּשְׁכָּ֑ח	1	Solomon is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

4:intro	z4ah				0	 # Proverbs 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### My son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [4:6–9](../04/06.md), wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator should translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n

5:intro	jxf1				0	# Proverbs 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### My son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter repeatedly warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, whom Solomon calls “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Euphemism\n\nIn [5:15–20](../05/15.md), Solomon uses several euphemisms to refer to sexual activity between a man and his wife or an adulterous woman. Although the UST expresses the meaning of these euphemisms plainly, only do so if sexual language would not be offensive in your culture. It is usually best to use a euphemism from your own language that means the same thing.

6:intro	xq95				0	# Proverbs 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### My son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter repeatedly warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, who is called “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:9](../06/09.md), [27](../06/27.md), [28](../06/28.md), Solomon uses rhetorical questions to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n\n### Animals used as examples\n\nIn this chapter, the gazelle, bird, and ant have certain characteristics which Solomon uses to teach about wisdom. If your language does not recognize those animals as being wise, you could add a footnote to explain or possibly substitute other animals from your culture that would help explain the same concept.

7:intro	pk5f				0	# Proverbs 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n    * The Story of an Adulterer (7:1–27)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### My son\n\nOccasionally Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter continues the theme about adulterous women and warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, who is called “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to developments in the story, Solomon uses the present tense in past narration in [7:8–13](../07/08.md) and [21–22](../07/21.md). If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

8:intro	z8jj				0	# Proverbs 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n    * The Story of an Adulterer (7:1–27)\n    * Wisdom benefits the wise (8:1–36)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Wisdom calls out\n\nIn this chapter and the next chapter, wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman who calls out for all to learn from her; she was with God when he created the universe. In languages where it is possible for something like wisdom to be spoken of as if it were a person who speaks, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate the personification as similes instead,. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. When wisdom speaks in [8:4–36](../08/04.md), the notes will use the proper noun “Wisdom” to indicate that the personification of wisdom is speaking.

9:intro	y75r				0	# Proverbs 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom (1:8–9:18)\n    * Avoid evil companions (1:8–19)\n    * Do not reject wisdom (1:20–33)\n    * Wisdom prevents people from committing crime or adultery (2:1–22)\n    * Humbly trust Yahweh (3:1–12)\n    * The value of wisdom (3:13–20)\n    * Do not act wickedly (3:21–35)\n    * Wisdom will benefit you (4:1–9)\n    * Behave wisely and avoid those who do not (4:10–19)\n    * Live righteously (4:20–27)\n    * Avoid temptation to commit adultery (5:1–23)\n    * Practical warnings (6:1–19)\n    * Adultery will be punished (6:20–35)\n    * The Story of an Adulterer (7:1–27)\n    * Wisdom benefits the wise (8:1–36)\n    * Wisdom and folly (9:1–18)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Wisdom calls out\n\nIn this chapter and the previous chapter, wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman who prepares a meal and calls out for all to come and learn from her. In languages where it is possible for something like wisdom to be spoken of as if it were a person who speaks, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate the personification as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. When wisdom speaks in [9:4–12](../09/04.md), the notes will use the proper noun “Wisdom” to indicate that the personification of wisdom is speaking. See how you translated similar references to wisdom in [1:20–33](../01/20.md) and [8:4–36](../08/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n

22:intro	t5zj				0	# Proverbs 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n3. Proverbs from Solomon (10:1–22:16)\n4. Sayings from wise men (22:17–24:22)\n    * Introduction to the sayings (22:17–21)\n    * The sayings (22:22–24:22)\n\nChapter 22 concludes the section of the book written by Solomon that is filled mainly with short, individual proverbs. Solomon wrote all 375 proverbs in [10:1](../10/01.md)–[22:16](../22/16.md). In [22:17](../22/17.md)–[21](../22/21.md), it seems that Solomon himself introduces a section of proverbs written by an unknown group of people called “the wise ones” wrote [22:22](../22/22.md)–[24:22](../24/22.md). Most of these proverbs of “the wise ones” are longer than one verse. Each individual of these proverbs will be marked in the notes.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 16–22 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 22 also contains contrasting parallelism ([22:3](../22/03.md), [12](../22/12.md)) and parallelism in which both clauses have the same meaning for emphasis ([22:1](../22/01.md), [24](../22/24.md), [26](../22/26.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [22:20](../22/20.md)–[21](../22/21.md) and [27](../22/27.md), the author uses rhetorical questions to emphasize the importance of what he is saying.

25:intro	l94s				0	# Proverbs 25 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon (25:1–29:27)\n    * Warnings and admonitions (25:1–27:27)\n    * Contrastive wise sayings (28:1–29:27)\n\nChapter 25 begins the section of the book containing proverbs written by Solomon that were copied by scribes during the reign of Hezekiah. This section contains two parts, the first part in [25:1](../25/01.md)–[27:27](../27/27.md) mostly contains proverbs that warn or admonish.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 25–27 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 25 also contains one instance of contrasting parallelism ([25:2](../25/02.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Metaphors\n\nSolomon uses many different metaphors in this chapter to warn his readers against acting unwisely. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

26:intro	juh9				0	# Proverbs 26 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon (25:1–29:27)\n    * Warnings and admonitions (25:1–27:27)\n    * Contrastive wise sayings (28:1–29:27)\n\nChapter 26 continues the section of the book containing proverbs written by Solomon that were copied by scribes during the reign of Hezekiah. This section contains two parts, the first part in [25:1](../25/01.md)–[27:27](../27/27.md) mostly contains proverbs that warn or admonish.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 25–27 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 26 contains only this type of parallelism. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Similes\n\nSolomon uses many different similes in this chapter to warn his readers against acting unwisely.

27:intro	ec7g				0	# Proverbs 27 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon (25:1–29:27)\n    * Warnings and admonitions (25:1–27:27)\n    * Contrastive wise sayings (28:1–29:27)\n\nChapter 27 continues the section of the book containing proverbs written by Solomon that were copied by scribes during the reign of Hezekiah. This section contains two parts, the first part in [25:1](../25/01.md)–[27:27](../27/27.md) mostly contains proverbs that warn or admonish.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 25–27 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 27 also contains contrasting parallelism ([27:3](../27/03.md), [27:4](../27/04.md), [6](../27/06.md), [7](../27/07.md), [12](../27/12.md)) and parallelism in which both clauses have the same meaning for emphasis ([27:2](../27/02.md), [23](../27/23.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Similes\n\nSolomon uses many different similes in this chapter to warn his readers against acting unwisely. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
27:1	t368		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֵּ֥לֶד יֽוֹם	1	Here, Solomon refers to what will happen on a certain **day** as if that **day** were a person who brings **forth** that event.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Let a stranger praise you and not your mouth, yes, let a foreigner praise you and not your lips”\n
27:2	yy2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	זָ֣ר & נָ֝כְרִ֗י	1	Here, **a stranger** and **a foreigner** refer to unfamiliar people in general, not specific people.

30:intro	aud8				0	# Proverbs 30 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n7. Sayings from Agur (30:1–33)\n    * Agur’s confession and prayer (30:1–9)\n    * Seven numerical sayings (30:10–31)\n    * Concluding warning (30:32–33)\n\nChapter 30 is the chapter in this book written by Agur, who is only mentioned here in the Bible.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Numerical sayings\n\nIn [Proverbs 30:10](../30/10.md)–[31](../30/31.md), Agur uses a rhetorical device in which he names a number that should be sufficient to illustrate his point and then increases that number by one for emphasis. If your language does not use numbers in this way, then consider more natural ways to express emphasis. Although he does not state the number of illustrations in [30:10](../30/10.md)–[14](../30/14.md), he does state the number of illustrations for the sayings in [30:15](../30/15.md)–[16](../30/16.md), [18](../30/18.md)–[19](../30/19.md), [21](../30/21.md)–[23](../30/23.md), [24](../30/24.md)–[28](../30/28.md), and [29](../30/29.md)–[31](../30/31.md).\n

30:1	ic3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠מַּ֫שָּׂ֥א	1	Here, **burden** refers to a warning message that Yahweh reveals to prophets so that they can tell it to other people. Because this message contained a warning or threat, it was considered to be a **burden** to the person who heard it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the warning from Yahweh”
30:1	yzki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ֭⁠גֶּבֶר	1	Here, **the strong man** refers to **Agur**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Agur, the strong man,”
30:1	y7qf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	לְ⁠אִֽיתִיאֵ֑ל לְ⁠אִ֖יתִיאֵ֣ל וְ⁠אֻכָֽל	1	All Hebrew manuscripts read **to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient translations of this text read “I am weary, O God. I am worn out and weary, O God,” which is based on a possible meaning for the Hebrew words. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Surely, no human has ascended to heaven and descended! Surely, no one but Yahweh has gathered the wind in the hollow of his hands! Surely, no one but Yahweh has wrapped waters in the cloak! Surely, no one but Yahweh has raised up all the ends of the earth!”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Surely, none of you know the name of someone who has done this or the name of his son because such a person does not exist!”
30:5	mna2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	צְרוּפָ֑ה	1	Here, Agur refers to what **God** says being true as if his sayings were metal that someone had melted and removed unwanted material from.

Alternate translation: “is proven to be true”\n
30:5	u15z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מָגֵ֥ן ה֝֗וּא	1	Here, Agur speaks of **God** protecting people as if he were a **shield**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he is a protector”

Here, **words** refers to what is said, as in [1:23](../01/23.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do not claim that God has said something that he did not really say”
30:6	e39x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִכְזָֽבְתָּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and he show you to be a liar”\n

30:7	tafl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	מֵ⁠אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form for **you**. Alternatively, it might be more appropriate in your culture to address God using a familiar form, such as friends would use with one another. Use your best judgment about which form to use.
30:7	qapv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	אַל־תִּמְנַ֥ע	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please do not withhold”
30:7	bl08		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אַל־תִּמְנַ֥ע	1	Agur is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: “Please do not give to me poverty or riches; please cause me to receive the bread of my portion”
30:8	wk6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רֵ֣אשׁ וָ֭⁠עֹשֶׁר אַל־תִּֽתֶּן־לִ֑⁠י	1	Here, Agur speaks of being poor or rich as if **poverty** and **riches** were physical objects that someone could **give** to someone else. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do not allow me to be poor or rich”

Description of a good and capable wife (31:10–31)\n\nChapter 31 is the chapter in this book written by Lemuel, who wrote down the advice that his mother told him. Lemuel is only mentioned here in the Bible.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Acrostic poem\n\n[Proverbs 31:10](../31/10.md)–[31](../31/31.md) is a poem in which each line begins with a successive letter of the alphabet in the original language. Using every letter of the language in that way expresses the idea of comprehensiveness and also helps people memorize the poem. In [31:10](../31/10.md)–[31](../31/31.md) the acrostic poem emphasizes that virtuous women demonstrate their virtue in everything that they do. If it is impossible to translate this poem into an acrostic poem in your language, you could use a different way in your language to indicate that these verses are one poem about the same topic. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])\n

Alternate translation: “This is what I should tell you, my son! And this is what I should tell you, son of my womb! And this is what I should tell you, son of my vows!” (2) exclamations in which **What** is not introducing a question. Alternate translation: “O, my son! O, son of my womb! O, son of my vows!”

31:2	p2hh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּר־נְדָרָֽ⁠י	1	Here, **vows** could mean: (1) the promise Lemuel’s mother made to dedicate her **son** to God if he allowed her to have a child.

31:4	d98h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	או	1	Some ancient copies and translations say that the word translated as **or** is a different word that means “desire” or “crave,” which makes sense because of the parallelism with **drink wine** in the previous clause.
