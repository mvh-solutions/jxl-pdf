front:intro	d989				0	# Introduction to Esther\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Esther\n\n1. King Ahasuerus sends away his wife, the queen (1:1–22)\n2. Ahasuerus chooses Esther as the new queen (2:1–23)\n3. Haman plots to destroy the Jews (3:1–15)\n4. Mordecai asks Esther to help her people (4:1–17)\n5. Esther pleads with the king for the Jews (5:1–7:10)\n6. The result of Haman’s plot to destroy the Jews (8:1–9:16)\n7. The Feast of Purim (9:17–32)\n8. Conclusion (10:1–3)\n\n### What is the Book of Esther about?\n\nThe Book of Esther tells how a young Jewish woman named Esther became the queen of Persia. As queen, she worked to save all the Jews in the Persian Empire from being destroyed.\n\nThis book ends by telling why the Jews celebrate the festival of Purim. The name “Purim” comes from the word “pur,” which means “lots” or “dice.” Haman, the enemy of Jews, threw dice to choose when to attack and destroy the Jews. The Jews celebrate Purim to remember how Yahweh rescued his people from being destroyed.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators can use the traditional title of this book, which is “The Book of Esther” or just “Esther.” Or they can choose a clearer title, such as “The Book About Esther.”\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the Persian Empire?\n\nKing Cyrus the Great conquered and ruled over many kingdoms. This was in the part of the world called Persia, which is now Iran. So people named his kingdom the Persian Empire. When Cyrus conquered Babylonia in 539 B.C., he then controlled the Jews whom the Babylonians had earlier taken into exile.\n\n### Why were there Jews in Babylonia when the Persians conquered it?\n\nIn 586 B.C., the Babylonians conquered and took into exile the people of Judah. These Jews and their descendants were still in Babylon when the Persians conquered it.\n\n### What was meant by “the laws of the Medes and Persians”?\n\nThe phrase “the laws of the Medes and Persians” is found in Esther 1:19 and Daniel 6:12. It referred to laws and decrees that could not be changed or removed once they were issued. In the book of Esther, the king made a decree that the people could attack the Jews. Later he regretted that decision but he was not able to change the decree.\n\nThe term “Medes” refers to a people group that had formed its own nation, but the Persians conquered them.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What different levels of language are in the Book of Esther?\n\nIn the Book of Esther, people talk to each other in many different situations. There is the polite and stately talk in the Persian court and the words of royal decrees. Friends and close relatives also talk to each other. There are even the words that one uses in speaking to oneself. Translators should use all the ways their own language has to express these different situations in a way that their readers will identify and understand.
1:intro	v1fp				0	# Esther 1 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The king’s divorce\n\nThe king’s advisers were afraid that husbands would lose their authority when they heard the queen had refused to come to show her beauty to the king’s guests, so the advisers told him to divorce her.
1:1	jdr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֖י	1	In the Old Testament, this is a standard way of beginning a historical story. Many languages have similar story-opening formulas, and if your language has one, you can use it. But do not use it if it would suggest that the story is not real, only made up. Alternate translation: “this account happened” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
1:1	zzz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ	1	The term **day** is used figuratively here to refer to a longer period of time. You could just say “during the reign of Ahasuerus,” as UST does. But as an alternative, you could say, “in the time of Ahasuerus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:1	qwe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ	1	This is a man’s name. It occurs many times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:1	v5ts		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ה֣וּא אֲחַשְׁוֵר֗וֹשׁ הַ⁠מֹּלֵךְ֙ מֵ⁠הֹ֣דּוּ וְ⁠עַד־כּ֔וּשׁ שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה	1	This is background information to help the reader identify Ahasuerus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:1	qwe3			ה֣וּא אֲחַשְׁוֵר֗וֹשׁ הַ⁠מֹּלֵךְ֙	1	Alternative translation: “This king named Ahasuerus ruled”
1:1	qwe5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	מֵ⁠הֹ֣דּוּ וְ⁠עַד־כּ֔וּשׁ	1	In case your audience might not know where these places are, you could say, “extending from India in the east to Ethiopia in the west.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:1	qwe7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה	1	The number is given to show what a large empire this was. You could say that explicitly by saying, “Ahasuerus ruled a very large empire that had 127 provinces.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:1	qwe8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה	1	Alternate translation: “one hundred twenty-seven provinces” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
1:2	dk31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כְּ⁠שֶׁ֣בֶת & עַ֚ל כִּסֵּ֣א מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	Here, the action of **sitting** on a throne is used figuratively to mean ruling over a kingdom. You could just say “ruled,” as UST does. But as an alternative, you could say, “ruled his empire from his royal throne” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:2	qwe9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עַ֚ל כִּסֵּ֣א מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate this idea with a verb by saying, “the throne he ruled from,” or use an adjective, “his royal throne.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:2	hgm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֥ן	1	This was the name of a royal city of the Persian kings. It occurs many times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:2	qwr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠בִּירָֽה	1	This means a castle or palace where a king would live. But since the city of Susa itself is being called a **citadel** here, it’s likely that the term figuratively means royal city or capital city. The person telling this story is identifying Susa as the capital by calling it by the name of something closely associated with it, the royal palace within it. A good translation might be “the capital city of Persia.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:3	ry7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֤ת שָׁלוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠מָלְכ֔⁠וֹ	1	This means that Ahasuerus had already ruled for two full years and that these events took place in the year that followed them. Alternate translation: “during the third year that Ahasuerus ruled his empire” or “after he had ruled for two years” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
1:3	qwr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֤ת שָׁלוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠מָלְכ֔⁠וֹ	1	**Reign** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate it with a verb by saying, “during the third year that Ahasuerus ruled.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:3	qwr5			עָשָׂ֣ה מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה	1	Alternative translation: “he hosted a feast”
1:3	prm1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	חֵ֣יל ׀ פָּרַ֣ס וּ⁠מָדַ֗י	1	This likely refers to the leaders of the army. It is describing a part of the army by referring to the whole army. Alternate translation: “the officers of the army” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1:3	qwr7			הַֽ⁠פַּרְתְּמִ֛ים	1	This probably means something like “the wealthy landowners.”
1:3	jdr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	**Face** figuratively stands for the presence of a person, so this phrase means “in his presence.” The invitation was to come to the royal capital to attend a banquet where the king would be present in person. You could say, as UST does, that the king was present in person to host the feast. Or you could say as an alternative, “all of them came to Susa for the feast” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:4	qwr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ אֶת־עֹ֨שֶׁר֙ כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	You can translate the abstract noun with an emphasized adjective. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus … wanted to demonstrate … the great wealth of his kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:4	qet1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ	1	**He** refers to the king. The implication is that he held this banquet to show all of his officials how wealthy and powerful he was. The invited officials would then go back to all the different parts of the empire and tell everyone this. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus wanted to demonstrate to his guests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:4	m8xa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	עֹ֨שֶׁר֙ כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	The words **wealth** and **glory** have similar meanings and they are used together to emphasize how great his kingdom was. Alternate translation: “the great wealth of his kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:4	qet3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ & וְ⁠אֶ֨ת־יְקָ֔ר תִּפְאֶ֖רֶת גְּדוּלָּת֑⁠וֹ	1	You can translate the abstract nouns **splendor**, **beauty**, and **greatness** as adjectives. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus … wanted to demonstrate … that he was a very powerful king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:4	lun5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יְקָ֔ר תִּפְאֶ֖רֶת גְּדוּלָּת֑⁠וֹ	1	The words **splendor** and **beauty** have similar meaning and emphasize how great he was. Alternate translation: “the splendor of his greatness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:4	qet5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָמִ֣ים רַבִּ֔ים שְׁמוֹנִ֥ים וּ⁠מְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם	1	This was a very long time for a royal feast to last. The earlier part of the verse provides the reason for this. To make the connection explicit, you could add some explanatory words to the verse like this: “Ahasuerus entertained his guests fabulously because he wanted to demonstrate that his empire was extremely wealthy and that he was a very powerful king. He did so many things for them that the festivities lasted for six months.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:4	x1v6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	שְׁמוֹנִ֥ים וּ⁠מְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם	1	Six months is about **180 days** or about half a year. You can use whatever expression will best express this time period in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
1:5	ue3x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בִ⁠מְל֣וֹאת ׀ הַ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה	1	This implies “at the end of that feast.” You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “after those 180 days were over” or “at the end of those six months” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:5	fv9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	עָשָׂ֣ה הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ & מִשְׁתֶּ֖ה	1	This was a second feast that the king hosted. He likely did this to thank the people who had worked so hard in hosting the first feast. You could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
1:5	mj16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֨ן הַ⁠בִּירָ֜ה	1	The expression in this case seems to refer specifically to the royal **citadel** from which the city got its name. This second feast would not have been for everyone in the entire city. It was specifically for the people who served the king in the citadel and who had worked so hard over the previous six months hosting the first feast. Alternate translation: “for every man who worked for him in the palace at Susa” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:5	qet7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הַ⁠נִּמְצְאִים֩	1	Here, **found** is an idiom that means could be found or were there. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:5	qet9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠נִּמְצְאִים֩	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “who worked for him in” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:5	qey1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	לְ⁠מִ⁠גָּ֧דוֹל וְ⁠עַד־קָטָ֛ן	1	The person telling this story is referring to the staff of the palace by speaking of two extreme parts of it, the most important and the least important people who worked there, in order to include everyone in between. You could just explain this meaning, as UST does. Alternate translation: “from the most important official to the least important servant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
1:5	qey3			שִׁבְעַ֣ת יָמִ֑ים	1	The story does not suggest that this was an unusually long time by saying, “for many days.” But you could also say something like “a whole week” to show that this was a generous gesture of thanks on the part of the king. Alternate translation: “another feast that lasted seven days”
1:6	qey5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ח֣וּר ׀ כַּרְפַּ֣ס וּ⁠תְכֵ֗לֶת	1	These **linens** were curtains that were hung in the courtyard. **Cotton** refers to the white color of some of them. So this means white and blue curtains. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:6	qey7			ח֣וּר ׀ כַּרְפַּ֣ס וּ⁠תְכֵ֗לֶת	1	You can specify at the beginning of this verse that the location being described is the same as in the previous verse: “In the courtyard, white and blue curtains.”
1:6	qey9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠חַבְלֵי־ב֣וּץ וְ⁠אַרְגָּמָ֔ן	1	**Byssus** means “white linen” and it is used to describe the white color of some of these cords. So this means white and purple cords. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:6	qru1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִטּ֣וֹת ׀ זָהָ֣ב וָ⁠כֶ֗סֶף	1	You can specify that these couches were there for the guests to recline on while they ate. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:6	asn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	רִֽצְפַ֥ת	1	This word probably refers to a mosaic floor made of inlaid pieces of colorful precious stones. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:6	eyi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּהַט	1	This is a kind of red and purple stone that contains pieces of crystal. You could call it “feldspar” or something descriptive like “red marble.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:6	qru3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וָ⁠שֵׁ֖שׁ	1	This is a white precious stone. You could identify it as “alabaster.” Alternatively, while it is not exactly the same thing as marble, your readers would get the right idea if you called it “white marble.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:6	qru5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠סֹחָֽרֶת	1	This word probably refers to a black marble that was used to create borders around mosaics. You could call this “black marble,” or you could just say that the floor contained “another precious stone.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:7	urm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠הַשְׁקוֹת֙	1	The abstract noun **serving** refers to how the drinks were served at the banquet. You can translate it with a verb by saying, “The attendants served wine.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:7	qru7			וְ⁠כֵלִ֖ים מִ⁠כֵּלִ֣ים שׁוֹנִ֑ים	1	This could mean that “no two of them were alike.” But you could also just say that the wine was served in “various kinds of golden cups.”
1:7	r6ec		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֵ֥ין מַלְכ֛וּת רָ֖ב כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	This means that King Ahasuerus himself paid for all the wine that the guests drank at his seven-day feast in Susa, and the wine came from his personal supply. Alternate translation: “the king was very generous with the royal wine” or “the king showed a great willingness to give” or “the king provided all of it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:7	qru9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠יֵ֥ין מַלְכ֛וּת רָ֖ב כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	This probably means special fine wine that only the king could acquire and afford. You can translate the abstract noun **royalty** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “royal wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:7	wpq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Here, **hand** refers figuratively to the king himself, viewed through his action of giving. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:8	qtu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁתִיָּ֥ה כַ⁠דָּ֖ת	1	The abstract noun **drinking** refers here not to the action of drinking, but to the guidelines for serving drinks that the king had established for the banquet. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus had established this rule for all his household attendants who served the wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:8	g5gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵ֣ין אֹנֵ֑ס	1	This could mean one of two things: (1) No one would be stopped from drinking even if the attendants thought they had already had enough. Alternate translation: “there was to be no restriction on drinking” (2) There would be no requirement to drink. Alternate translation: “no one must be forced to drink” Either way, this was another sign of the generosity that the king showed as he hosted this banquet to thank the people who worked for him. Either he was: (1) allowing them to drink as much as they wanted to, or (2) not requiring them to eat and drink everything that was served at a banquet as guests of the king would usually be expected to do. You could say explicitly at the beginning of the verse that the king was giving his guests a special privilege. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:8	f6px		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּי־כֵ֣ן ׀ יִסַּ֣ד הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ עַ֚ל כָּל־רַ֣ב בֵּית֔⁠וֹ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת כִּ⁠רְצ֥וֹן אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ	1	This explains why no one had to drink if they did not want to. If it would be helpful in your language, you could give this explanation (the reason) before the result that it accounts for, using a connecting word like “so.” You could say, “The king had established for every overseer of his house to do according to the desire of man by man, so the drinking was according to the law, ‘There is no compulsion.’” Alternate translation: “the king made the attendants who served the wine follow this rule” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:8	qtu3			לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת כִּ⁠רְצ֥וֹן אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ	1	Alternate translation: “the king wanted every guest to be able to drink as much as he wanted” or “all the guests could drink as little or as much as they wanted”
1:8	jdr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ	1	This is an idiom that means “everyone.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:9	qtu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	גַּ֚ם	1	This introduces something else that was happening at the same time. You can indicate this by saying something like “during this time.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1:9	qtu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וַשְׁתִּ֣י הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֔ה	1	You can explain that she was the wife of Ahasuerus by saying, “Queen Vashti**,** the king’s wife” or “his wife.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
1:9	qtu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַשְׁתִּ֣י הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֔ה	1	This is a woman’s name. It occurs several times in this chapter and the next one. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:9	qti1			מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה נָשִׁ֑ים	1	This could mean the women who served in the palace, the wives of the men who were officers and servants, or both. You could say, “a feast for the wives of the men who attended” or “for the women who worked in the palace.”
1:9	qti3			בֵּ֚ית הַ⁠מַּלְכ֔וּת אֲשֶׁ֖ר לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֽוֹשׁ	1	Alternate translation: “the royal palace where King Ahasuerus lived”
1:9	qti5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בֵּ֚ית הַ⁠מַּלְכ֔וּת	1	You can translate the abstract noun **royalty** with the adjective royal. Alternate translation: “royal palace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:10	jv7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּוֹם֙ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	Alternate translation: “after six days” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
1:10	le6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כְּ⁠ט֥וֹב לֵב־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ בַּ⁠יָּ֑יִן	1	Here, **heart** figuratively means the action of thinking or feeling. Alternate translation: “when King Ahasuerus was in a good mood from drinking wine” or “when the king was drunk with wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:10	dcb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	לִ֠⁠מְהוּמָן בִּזְּתָ֨א חַרְבוֹנָ֜א בִּגְתָ֤א וַ⁠אֲבַגְתָא֙ זֵתַ֣ר וְ⁠כַרְכַּ֔ס	1	These are names of seven men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:10	ens5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠סָּ֣רִיסִ֔ים	1	This term occurs a dozen times in the story. It describes male royal officials who served as guardians for the women who lived in the palace. They were both guardians of the door, to keep unwanted people out of the women’s quarters, and guardians of the women inside, to take care of them and look after their needs. (As we learn in 2:21, some of these officials also protected the king’s private quarters.) As we see here, and as will also be seen in 2:14 and 2:16, their duties included escorting women from place to place. The term likely indicates that, in keeping with the practices of the time, these men were castrated because their work brought them into such close contact with the king’s wives and concubines. If your language has a term for such an official and you think your readers would recognize it, you could use it. Otherwise, you could use a term that describes the role that these officials played in the royal court. Alternate translation: “guardians” or “officials” or “castrated servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:10	qti7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	הַ⁠מְשָׁ֣רְתִ֔ים אֶת־פְּנֵ֖י הַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֽוֹשׁ	1	This is background information to explain who these men were. Alternate translation: “who attended him personally” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:10	jdr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־פְּנֵ֖י הַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ	1	Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. The phrase means that these seven men served King Ahasuerus personally. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:11	qti9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ֠⁠הָבִיא	1	This is the beginning of the instructions that King Ahasuerus gave to the seven eunuchs he summoned in verse 10. You can make this explicit by saying, “He told them to bring.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:11	jdr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. The phrase means that King Ahasuerus wanted Queen Vashti to come personally into his presence. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:11	asd1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠כֶ֣תֶר מַלְכ֑וּת	1	You can translate the abstract noun **royalty** with an adjective by saying, “wearing her royal crown.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:11	asd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠כֶ֣תֶר מַלְכ֑וּת	1	Ahasuerus likely wanted Vashti to wear her queen’s crown so that everyone would know that she was his wife. You could say that explicitly. (For the possible reasons why he wanted them to know this, see the next note.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

He seems to have believed that having a very beautiful wife was one more thing that proved he was a great man. So he wanted everyone to see how beautiful Vashti was. You can put this second in the verse, after explaining that Vashti was a very beautiful woman, because it accounts for what happens afterwards, when the king sends his seven personal servants to bring her in to his banquet.

1:17	jd17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי	1	This introduces the reason why Memukan says that Queen Vashti has done wrong against all the men in the kingdom and not only against King Ahasuerus.

2:5	kw5t			אִ֥ישׁ יְמִינִֽי	1	While this likely refers to Kish, it is necessarily also true of Mordecai, and you could put it second in the verse. That way Mordecai’s nationality would come first, then his tribe, and then his family and clan. Alternate translation: “from the tribe of Benjamin”

2:9	zcb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תִּיטַ֨ב הַ⁠נַּעֲרָ֣ה בְ⁠עֵינָי⁠ו֮	1	Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment.

As the story has already explained, he would then choose one of them to become his queen and primary wife. But the king would still provide for each of the concubines for the rest of her life; they would not be free to marry anyone else. This is something that the story’s original audience would have understood implicitly. you could say it explicitly if your readers need this information to understand the story: “Each young woman in the harem, one at a time, was going to have sexual relations with King Ahasuerus and become one of his concubines” or “one of his secondary wives.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:12	p7i5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כְּ⁠דָ֤ת הַ⁠נָּשִׁים֙	1	Here, **law** probably does not mean a legal decree, but rather a standard regimen that had been developed. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:12	abd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	כִּ֛י כֵּ֥ן יִמְלְא֖וּ יְמֵ֣י מְרוּקֵי⁠הֶ֑ן	1	This phrase indicates that the story is now going to provide background information on how these treatments were done.

2:12	abd8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שִׁשָּׁ֤ה חֳדָשִׁים֙ בְּ⁠שֶׁ֣מֶן הַ⁠מֹּ֔ר	1	This means that a woman’s attendants would rub her body with olive oil mixed with myrrh every day for six months. you could explain this in more detail if your readers need this information to understand the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:12	abd9			בְּ⁠שֶׁ֣מֶן הַ⁠מֹּ֔ר	1	This likely means “olive oil mixed with myrrh.”
2:12	zhd1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וּ⁠בְ⁠תַמְרוּקֵ֖י הַ⁠נָּשִֽׁים	1	This means lotions designed for women. In 2:3 and 2:9, this one specific part of the program seems to be used figuratively to mean all of it, and so in those verses it can be translated “beauty treatments.” But it should be translated with a specific term or phrase here, such as “women’s lotions” or “feminine ointments” because it is named along with oils and perfumes as one component of the treatment. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:13	abd0			וּ⁠בָ⁠זֶ֕ה	1	Alternate translation: “after a woman’s year of beauty treatments was completed”
2:13	abe0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֖ה בָּאָ֣ה אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	This means that the young woman would go and have sexual relations with the king and thereby become one of his concubines. If your readers need this information to understand the story, you could explain that here, if you did not do so in verse 12. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	abe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֨ר תֹּאמַ֜ר יִנָּ֤תֵֽן לָ⁠הּ֙	1	**Anything** most likely refers to clothing and jewelry. This phrase probably means that a woman could take any of those that she wanted from the harem for virgins and wear them when she went to the king’s palace. You could say that explicitly by saying, “A young woman could take whatever clothing and jewelry she wanted from the harem for virgins and wear them when she went to the king’s palace.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	v133		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֨ר תֹּאמַ֜ר יִנָּ֤תֵֽן לָ⁠הּ֙	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “she could take whatever she wanted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

2:14	abe4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִ֣יא בָאָ֗ה	1	She would not walk over on her own. Rather, the king’s servants would come and bring her to the king’s private quarters, in the way that they were told to bring Vashti to the banquet in [1:11](../01/11.md). you could say this explicitly if it would help your readers to understand the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:14	ded5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֠⁠בַ⁠בֹּקֶר הִ֣יא שָׁבָ֞ה	1	It is implied that this is the following morning. This information can be made clear.

Just as Hegai was the overseer of the virgins, Shaashgaz was the overseer of the concubines, so he would be the one responsible for Esther while she was in the harem for concubines. Alternate translation: “under the custody of Shaashgaz” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	q5yx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	שַֽׁעֲשְׁגַ֛ז	1	This is a man’s name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

2:14	abe6			שֹׁמֵ֣ר הַ⁠פִּֽילַגְשִׁ֑ים	1	This means that Shaashgaz was the official who *took care of the concubines* or who was responsible for the concubines.
2:14	abe7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠פִּֽילַגְשִׁ֑ים	1	As a **concubine**, the young woman was one of the king’s secondary wives. She would live in this harem for the rest of her life. She was not free to return to her family or to marry anybody else. If it would help your readers to understand the story, you could explain all or part of this to your readers here, if you did not do so in 2:12 or 2:13. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:14	abe8			לֹא־תָב֥וֹא עוֹד֙ אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	In verse 12, the Note mentioned that “go to the king” meant “have sexual relations with the king.” But for this occurrence of the expression, it is appropriate to use a more general phrase such as “visit the king” because there could be other, more social reasons for a further visit. The woman would now be a secondary wife, and the king would only send for her if he decided that he enjoyed being with her. Alternate translation: “She would not go and see the king again”
2:14	abe9			חָפֵ֥ץ בָּ֛⁠הּ	1	This means that he “had enjoyed being with her” or that she “had pleased the king very much.”
2:14	abf0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִקְרְאָ֥ה בְ⁠שֵֽׁם	1	You can say this with an active form. For example, you can say, “and the king asked for her by name” or “and called for her by name.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

A contrast is being drawn. A young woman could take any clothing and jewelry she wanted from the harem. But Esther only asked for what Hegai recommended. So it would be good to introduce this episode with a word such as “but,” which draws a contrast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:15	jk51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	בַּת־אֲבִיחַ֣יִל דֹּ֣ד מָרְדֳּכַ֡י אֲשֶׁר֩ לָקַֽח־ל֨⁠וֹ לְ⁠בַ֜ת	1	This background information reminds the reader who Esther was by describing her relationship to Mordecai. You could make this a separate sentence and move it later in the verse to keep from breaking up the flow of the first sentence about what Esther did. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
2:15	mg8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֲבִיחַ֣יִל	1	This man was Esther’s father and Mordecai’s uncle. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

2:15	vw9r			אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֹאמַ֛ר הֵגַ֥י	1	Alternate translation: “what Hegai recommended” or “what Hegai suggested”
2:15	abf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֹאמַ֛ר הֵגַ֥י	1	As the king’s personal servant, **Hegai** would have known what kind of clothing and jewelry Ahasuerus found attractive on a woman. By following his advice, Esther showed that she trusted Hegai. This is implicit information that you could make explicit if it would help the reader to understand the story. You might say, for example, “Hegai knew the king’s preferences because he was his personal servant. Esther had come to trust Hegai and so she followed his advice.” This could go at the end of the verse or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:15	abf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	סְרִיס־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ שֹׁמֵ֣ר הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים	1	This is saying that Hegai was the royal official responsible for the women in the harem for virgins. This is background information that reminds the reader who Hegai was by describing his responsibilities. You could also move this to the end of the verse and put it in parentheses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
2:15	abf3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	סְרִיס־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	See how you decided to translate the term **eunuch** in [1:10](../01/10.md). You could say “royal” for “of the king.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:15	z519		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נֹשֵׂ֣את חֵ֔ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֖י כָּל־רֹאֶֽי⁠הָ	1	This is a rare expression in Hebrew, and the exact meaning is uncertain. In this context, the expression probably means that everyone who saw Esther dressed in the clothes she would wear for her visit to the king was very impressed with the way she looked. Alternate translation: “pleased all who saw her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:15	jd87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֖י	1	Here, **eyes** is a metonym for seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. In this context, the phrase probably means that everyone who saw Esther thought that she was either an attractive woman or a pleasant person, or both. Alternate translation: “in the judgment of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:15	jd89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כָּל־רֹאֶֽי⁠הָ	1	This phrase can mean either **every man or every person who saw her**. Alternate translation: “every man who saw her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:16	jd91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תִּלָּקַ֨ח אֶסְתֵּ֜ר	1	You can say this with an active form by saying, for example, “The king’s servants brought Esther.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:16	abf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֶל־בֵּ֣ית מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	You can use an adjective to translate the abstract noun **royalty.** For example, you can say, “in his royal palace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

2:16	jr5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	הוּא־חֹ֣דֶשׁ טֵבֵ֑ת	1	**Tebeth** is the name of the tenth month of the Hebrew calendar. Alternate translation: “that is, the month of Tebeth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
2:16	abf6			חֹ֣דֶשׁ טֵבֵ֑ת	1	The story is being recorded from the perspective of the Persian court. But for the benefit of its intended Jewish audience, the Hebrew name of the month is given.
2:16	abf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חֹ֣דֶשׁ טֵבֵ֑ת	1	You could convert the Hebrew days and months into approximate dates on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the dates will be different every year and the translation will not be quite accurate. So you may just want to provide the Hebrew days and months. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

The information is given twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that Ahasuerus was completely convinced that Esther was the one he should make his queen**.** “More than all the virgins” basically duplicates the meaning of “more than all the women,” so, if this duplication would be confusing in your language, you don’t need to include both phrases, or you could say, “more than all of them” for the second phrase. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
2:17	abf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים	1	This means all the other women who had been brought to the king and who became his concubines. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	bcu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּשָּׂא־חֵ֥ן וָ⁠חֶ֛סֶד לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו	1	This is a rare expression in Hebrew, and the exact meaning is uncertain. See how you translated similar phrases in [2:9](../02/09.md) and [2:15](../02/15.md). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. In this context, it probably means that King Ahasuerus was very impressed with both Esther’s appearance and her personality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:17	abf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַ⁠תִּשָּׂא־חֵ֥ן וָ⁠חֶ֛סֶד לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו	1	**Favor** and **kindness** mean similar things and are probably used together here to strengthen a single idea.

2:17	jd93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

2:17	abg0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כֶּֽתֶר־מַלְכוּת֙	1	To translate the abstract noun **royalty**, you can use an adjective such as a “royal” crown. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

2:18	b1hd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה אֶסְתֵּ֑ר	1	You could indicate to your readers this is the name that Ahasuerus gave to the feast, for example, “He called it ‘Esther’s Feast.’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:18	ufm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וַ⁠הֲנָחָ֤ה לַ⁠מְּדִינוֹת֙ עָשָׂ֔ה	1	This was probably a “tax holiday,” that is, a temporary elimination of taxes. For a time, the provinces did not have to send in the usual taxes to the king. You could say something like “he proclaimed a temporary reprieve from taxes for all the provinces of his empire.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:18	jd95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Here, **hand** figuratively represents the action of doing or giving. The phrase means that King Ahasuerus personally gave lavish gifts to the guests at this feast. You could say something like “with royal generosity” or “with great willingness to give” or “with generosity that only a king can give.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

2:19	p842		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בְ⁠הִקָּבֵ֥ץ בְּתוּל֖וֹת שֵׁנִ֑ית	1	The most likely explanation for this is that Ahasuerus decided he would like to have more concubines. you could say this explicitly if it will help the readers to understand the story. He probably believed that having a large number of concubines was another thing that would show he was a great king. To do so, you could add: “because Ahasuerus decided that he would like to have more concubines.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:19	abg2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בְ⁠הִקָּבֵ֥ץ בְּתוּל֖וֹת שֵׁנִ֑ית	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) (2) Mordecai sat there so he could hear about how Esther was doing from the many people who passed through the gate.
2:19	i8in			בְּ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Alternate translation: “the gate to the king’s house” or “the gate to the king’s palace”
2:20	abg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	מֽוֹלַדְתָּ⁠הּ֙ וְ⁠אֶת־עַמָּ֔⁠הּ	1	These two short phrases mean almost the same thing.

2:21	abg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יֹשֵׁ֣ב בְּ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	As in verse 19, this is likely an idiom that means that Mordecai worked for the king in some capacity and was stationed at the gate where officials met to make important decisions.

2:21	abh0			מִ⁠שֹּׁמְרֵ֣י הַ⁠סַּ֔ף	1	In this case the men were not guardians of one of the harems but guardians of the king’s private rooms. You could say, “they guarded the doorway to the king’s private rooms” or “they protected the doorway to the king’s private quarters.”
2:21	abh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְבַקְשׁוּ֙	1	Here, **seeking** figuratively means actively trying to do something. Alternate translation: “they were plotting” or “they wanted to find a way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:21	jd97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֣חַ יָ֔ד	1	Here the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing him. You could say, “they were planning to assassinate him.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “wooden structure” or “wooden pole” or “gallows” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:23	g9nh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּכָּתֵ֗ב	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. You can say, for example, “The king’s scribes recorded an account of this.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:23	abh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠סֵ֛פֶר דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠יָּמִ֖ים	1	This is an idiom that describes a regular record of the events in a king’s reign. You could call this “the royal chronicles.” Alternate translation: “the daily record book” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:23	abh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Here, **face** refers figuratively to the presence of a person. The phrase means that the scribes wrote this account while King Ahasuerus was personally present. You could say that they did this in the king’s presence. Alternate translation: “the king watched a scribe write this down” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:intro	zb26				0	# Esther 3 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Haman plots against the Jews\n\nMordecai was told to prostrate himself before Haman. This would be considered to be worship. But for a Jew, it was wrong to worship someone other than Yahweh. Because of this, he refused to do it. This made Haman angry, so he decided to kill all the Jews in the Persian Empire. Haman was a descendant of Agag, a king of the Amalekite people. The Amalekites became the enemies of the Jews during the exodus (Exodus 17:8-16). Moses told the people that they would need to destroy them (Deuteronomy 25:17-19), and later God commanded Saul to destroy them (1 Samuel 15:2-3). Samuel killed King Agag (1 Samuel 15:33), but the Amalekites were never completely destroyed (1 Samuel 30:17). Both Mordecai and Haman were probably very aware that their people were enemies.

3:1	abh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גִּדַּל֩ & אֲחַשְׁוֵר֜וֹשׁ אֶת־הָמָ֧ן	1	This means that Ahasuerus **promoted** Haman. It’s implied in the story that Haman was already one of Ahasuerus’s officials, but that he was now being promoted to a higher position. You could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:1	abi0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַֽ⁠יְנַשְּׂאֵ֑⁠הוּ וַ⁠יָּ֨שֶׂם֙ אֶת־כִּסְא֔⁠וֹ מֵ⁠עַ֕ל כָּל־הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. They are used together to emphasize that the king was making Haman very powerful. You could combine them and say something like, “the king gave Haman a very high position that was over all of his other officials.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:1	pl9i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יְנַשְּׂאֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Here, **lifting** is a metaphor meaning to advance or promote a person to a higher, more important position than they held previously. Alternate translation: “he gave him a more important position” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:1	ptm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּסְא֔⁠וֹ	1	Here, **seat of authority** means Haman’s position or status in the Persian government. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:1	abi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כִּסְא֔⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **authority**, you can express the same idea with a concrete noun for this whole phrase. For example, you can say, “his position.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:1	abi2			מֵ⁠עַ֕ל כָּל־הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר אִתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	**Him** in this phrase may refer to the king. You could say that “the king promoted him above his other officials” or “gave him more authority than all of his other officials” or that “Haman became more important than all of his other officials.”
3:2	abi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠כָל־עַבְדֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	Here, the **gate of the king**, probably the entrance to the citadel, may figuratively represent the citadel itself, the place where these people served the king. The citadel, in turn, would represent everyone who served the king. So you could say just “all the king’s other servants.” However, this may also be a reference to the specific group of officials who were stationed at the gate, the way Mordecai was. Alternate translation: “the royal officials who were stationed at the palace gate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:2	abi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠כָל־עַבְדֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ & כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ לְ⁠הָמָ֔ן	1	The servants were required to do this as a way of honoring him whenever Haman walked by. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:2	e25k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙	1	This means that the other officials humbled themselves and lay flat on the ground before Haman. These actions represented recognition and respect for the very high position that the king had given him in the Persian government. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
3:2	abi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that the officials knew how important it was to obey the king’s command and honor Haman in this way. You could combine them as UST does and say something like “bow down all the way to the ground.” Alternate translation: “bowing and lying down on the ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:2	fg8v			וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙	1	This means bowing down all the way to the ground.
3:2	jd99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּי־כֵ֖ן צִוָּה־ל֣⁠וֹ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this information first in the verse because it explains the reason why all the other officials were bowing to Haman. See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:2	abi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּי־כֵ֖ן צִוָּה־ל֣⁠וֹ	1	The king did this as a sign of Haman’s new position. You can state this here or in a separate sentence, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “the king had commanded them to do this in order to show that he had given Haman such a high position” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:2	abi7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וּ⁠מָ֨רְדֳּכַ֔י לֹ֥א יִכְרַ֖ע וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶֽה	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was against the king’s command and how much determination it took for Mordecai to remain standing. You could combine these phrases as UST does and say, “But Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai did not bow down or lie on the ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
3:2	abi8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מָ֨רְדֳּכַ֔י לֹ֥א יִכְרַ֖ע וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶֽה	1	It appears that as a Jew, Mordecai considered it wrong to worship anyone other than Yahweh, and that he believed he would be worshiping Haman if he bowed down low to the ground to honor him. So, on religious grounds, Mordecai refused to bow down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	abi9			עַבְדֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	See how you translated this expression at the beginning of [3:2](../03/02.md).
3:3	abj0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמְר֜וּ & לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֑י	1	They spoke to Mordecai because they saw that he did not bow down.

You could say, for example, “The other officials saw that, and they asked Mordecai.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	abj1			מַדּ֨וּעַ֙ אַתָּ֣ה עוֹבֵ֔ר אֵ֖ת מִצְוַ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Alternative translation: “why are you disobeying the king’s command” or “why are you not obeying what the king commanded”
3:4	jd3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ב⁠אמר⁠ם אֵלָי⁠ו֙	1	This means that they spoke to him about not bowing down. Specifically, they warned him that he would be severely punished if he kept disobeying the king and not honoring his highest official. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:4	jd1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	י֣וֹם וָ⁠י֔וֹם	1	This expression means “every day.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Mordecai heard them, but he did not do what they advised him to do. This means that even though the other officials questioned him and probably warned him, he still refused to bow down. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:4	uek4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּגִּ֣ידוּ לְ⁠הָמָ֗ן לִ⁠רְאוֹת֙ הֲ⁠יַֽעַמְדוּ֙ דִּבְרֵ֣י מָרְדֳּכַ֔י	1	In this context, **standing** figuratively means to survive a challenge, and **words** means the reasons that Mordecai gave for his actions. This phrase means that the other officials told Haman about it to see if he would tolerate it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:4	abj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥יד לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא יְהוּדִֽי	1	This is the answer that Mordecai gave the other officials when they asked him why he refused to bow down to Haman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put it first in the verse because it explains everything that happens afterwards. Alternate translation: “Mordecai told them that he was a Jew, and that Jews would bow down only to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:4	abj4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥יד לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא יְהוּדִֽי	1	Mordecai’s explanation would have included the fact that Jews would only worship Yahweh.

3:5	abj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא הָמָ֔ן	1	Here, **seeing** figuratively means knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. This phrase means that Haman learned about this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	njt5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֵ֣ין מָרְדֳּכַ֔י כֹּרֵ֥עַ וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖ה ל֑⁠וֹ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was. You could combine them as UST does and say, “Mordecai was refusing to bow down to him.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai would not bow down or lie on the ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
3:5	wk8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֥א הָמָ֖ן חֵמָֽה	1	Here, **Haman’s rage** is spoken of as something that could fill him up. You could say that he was furious or extremely angry. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:6	k5h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Haman considered that it was not enough” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:6	abj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	Haman probably decided to go to such extremes because he was so angry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:6	abj7			וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז	1	**Despise** in this context means not to hate but to think little of or think something is too small. This expression means that Haman decided it would not be enough just to kill Mordecai alone.
3:6	jd9r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	Here, **eyes** stand for “seeing,” and in this case “seeing” figuratively means judgment. This phrase means in Haman’s judgment. Alternate translation: “as he saw it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:6	abj8			לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֤ח יָד֙ בְּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֣י לְ⁠בַדּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: “he rejected the idea of killing only Mordecai” or “he decided to kill more than just Mordecai” or “he decided that it would not be enough to get rid of only Mordecai”
3:6	j11r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֤ח יָד֙	1	As in [2:21](../02/21.md), the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:6	abj9			כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥ידוּ ל֖⁠וֹ אֶת־עַ֣ם מָרְדֳּכָ֑י	1	**They** means the other royal officials. **Him** refers to Haman. **The people of Mordecai** means the Jews. Mordecai had told these officials that he would not bow down to Haman because Jews worshiped only God. So this means that the other officials had told Haman that Mordecai was not bowing down to him because he was a Jew.
3:6	hue9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְבַקֵּ֣שׁ הָמָ֗ן לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֧יד	1	Here, **seeking** figuratively means trying to do something. In this context, it means that Haman decided that he would try to kill all the Jews. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:6	abk0			בְּ⁠כָל־מַלְכ֥וּת אֲחַשְׁוֵר֖וֹשׁ	1	This means in the entire empire that King Ahasuerus ruled.
3:6	abk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֛ים & עַ֥ם מָרְדֳּכָֽי	1	These two phrases refer to the same group of people.

3:7	zl12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠חֹ֤דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁוֹן֙	1	Alternate translation: “In month one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
3:7	wyv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	הוּא־חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֔ן	1	**Nisan** is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
3:7	abk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֔ן	1	As in [2:16](../02/16.md), you could convert the Hebrew month into an approximate time on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the dates will be different every year and the translation will not be quite accurate. So you may just want to give the Hebrew month. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:7	tw99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנַת֙ שְׁתֵּ֣ים עֶשְׂרֵ֔ה לַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ	1	Alternate translations: “during the twelfth year of the reign of Ahasuerus as king of Persia” or “when King Ahasuerus had reigned for about twelve years” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
3:7	g4lt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩ ה֨וּא הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֜ל	1	The storyteller is giving both the Persian and the Hebrew name because this is the story behind the Festival of Purim, which takes its name from “Pur.” So this is not repetition for emphasis. You can put in the Persian name and the word for “lot” in your own language to show that the storyteller is doing this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:7	abk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֜ל	1	A **lot** was an object with different markings on various sides that was used, most likely by dropping it on the ground, to select a specific time for doing something. The belief was that God or the gods would control which way the object fell, thus guiding the selection process and granting favor to the action if it were done on the date chosen. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:7	abk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. You can say, for example, “Haman had his servants cast a Pur.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:7	abk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this information first because it explains the rest of what happens in this verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:7	j13r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הָמָ֗ן	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. In this context, the phrase means that Haman was physically present when the lot was cast. Alternate translation: “as Haman watched” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:7	j15r			מִ⁠יּ֧וֹם ׀ לְ⁠י֛וֹם וּ⁠מֵ⁠חֹ֛דֶשׁ לְ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ	1	This expression means that the lot was cast to select a particular day of the month and a particular month of the year.
3:7	j17r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠יּ֧וֹם ׀ לְ⁠י֛וֹם וּ⁠מֵ⁠חֹ֛דֶשׁ לְ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ	1	Haman was casting the lot to determine the best day and the best month to kill the Jews. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to determine the best day and the best month to kill the Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	ih4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר	1	**Adar** is the name of the twelfth and last month of the Hebrew calendar. This name occurs several times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
3:7	abk6			שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר	1	See how you decided in [2:16](../02/16.md) and the first part of this verse to represent the dates that are given in the Hebrew calendar in the book of Esther. Be consistent.
3:7	abk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר	1	This means that the lot indicated the twelfth month of that year as the time for Haman to carry out his plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. (The day that was chosen is reported in verse 13.) Alternate translation: “the lot indicated the twelfth month, the month of Adar, as the best month to kill the Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	k3vd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר	1	Alternative translation: “month twelve” or “the twelfth month” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
3:8	abk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר הָמָן֙ לַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֔וֹשׁ	1	The implication is that Haman then went to see the king so that he could speak with him. You could say that explicitly. Do not give your readers the impression that the king was present with Haman while he was casting the lot. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:8	aig9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	יֶשְׁנ֣⁠וֹ עַם־אֶחָ֗ד	1	**He** refers to the king, and **one people** refers to the Jews as a people group. So this means there is a people group or a group of people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
3:8	p4a8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	מְפֻזָּ֤ר וּ⁠מְפֹרָד֙	1	These two words mean almost the same thing. Haman uses the repetition to emphasize that the Jews are everywhere throughout the empire and so their influence, which he says is bad, will affect everyone. You could combine these words as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:8	abk9			בֵּ֣ין הָֽ⁠עַמִּ֔ים בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל מְדִינ֣וֹת מַלְכוּתֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Haman is saying that the Jews are mixed in with all the other peoples, and they live in every province.

3:8	r34x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	דָּתֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You could have him say, “your laws.” Or you could indicate this respect another way by having Haman begin by saying, “Your Majesty.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
3:8	bf9g			וְ⁠לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֵין־שֹׁוֶ֖ה לְ⁠הַנִּיחָֽ⁠ם	1	Haman is saying, “It is not good for you to allow them to live in your empire.” This can also be stated without the negative. Alternate translation: “the king should remove them” or “you should remove them”
3:8	j19r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ	1	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You could express the same meaning in the second person by saying, “not good for you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
3:9	abl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	Haman speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
3:9	abl2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	See how you decided to translate this idiom in [1:19](../01/19.md). Alternate translation: “if it seems like a good idea to you, O king” or “if the king thinks this is a good idea” or “if this advice is pleasing to the king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:9	abl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִכָּתֵ֖ב	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who would do the action. For example, you could say, “the king could write a decree” or “you could write a decree.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:9	abl4			לְ⁠אַבְּדָ֑⁠ם	1	This means that the decree would say that all the Jews should be killed.
3:9	eh3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶשְׁקוֹל֙ עַל־יְדֵי֙ עֹשֵׂ֣י הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה	1	This could mean either of two possibilities: (1) Haman could mean that the king’s men will be able to collect a huge amount of money from the plunder that they would get from the Jews. Referring to the weight would be a way of saying, “I guarantee that it will be at least that much.” This reasoning agrees with 3:13, where the king’s letter specifies that those who kill the Jews can take their plunder. Alternate translation: “we will get so much plunder that the officers you send will be able to bring back” (Also see UST) (2) “**Weigh out into the hands**” could be an idiom that means Haman himself will pay the officers who will put the plan into effect. Haman will not do this personally, but it means that he will take responsibility for paying them from his own resources. Alternate translation: “From my own resources I will pay … to the men who do the work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:9	lhv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	וַ⁠עֲשֶׂ֨רֶת אֲלָפִ֜ים כִּכַּר־כֶּ֗סֶף	1	This would be worth over $300 million at current prices today. But since prices vary over time, if you expressed the value in modern measurements, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate. Instead you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the talent, and explain in a note that a talent was equivalent to about 30 kilograms. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does in metric tons. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
3:9	vm59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וַ⁠עֲשֶׂ֨רֶת אֲלָפִ֜ים כִּכַּר־כֶּ֗סֶף	1	The **talent** was the largest unit of money and **10,000** was the largest number in the counting system of the time. It is possible that Haman used these terms to represent a very large, but not precise, amount. Alternate translation: “a huge amount of silver” or “enormous amounts of silver” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:9	abl5			עֹשֵׂ֣י הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה	1	This could mean: (1) those who work for the king in general (administrators) or (2) more specifically the officers whom Ahasuerus would send around the empire to organize the killing of the Jews.
3:9	abl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	גִּנְזֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Haman speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. You could also have him speak of “your royal treasuries.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
3:10	abl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֧סַר הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֶת־טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֗⁠הּ לְ⁠הָמָ֧ן	1	The implication is that Ahasuerus thought that Haman’s suggestion was a good idea and he agreed to it. You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king agreed that this was a good idea, so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:10	abl9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יָּ֧סַר הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֶת־טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֗⁠הּ לְ⁠הָמָ֧ן	1	**Giving the ring to Haman** showed that Haman could act on the king’s own authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king gave Haman the power to act on his authority to carry out the plan. To show that, he gave Haman the ring he wore that had his official seal on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
3:10	c9md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	This was a special ring that could be used to imprint the king’s official seal on a law or decree. This ring had the king’s name or mark on it. When he put a wax seal on important papers, he would press the mark onto the seal. If a paper had this mark on its seal, people would know that what was written on the paper was written with the king’s authority and had to be obeyed. You could describe this as “the ring he wore that had his official seal on it.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:10	abm0			בֶּֽן־הַמְּדָ֛תָא הָ⁠אֲגָגִ֖י	1	This information about Haman’s identity is repeated to stress that the king giving him the signet ring was an official legal act that transferred power to him. (In the same way, legal documents today often use a person’s full name and other identifying information.) If you repeat this information in your own translation, your readers should see this significance.
3:10	abm1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	צֹרֵ֥ר הַ⁠יְּהוּדִֽים	1	This phrase gives clarifying information about Haman. It means that he had become “the enemy of the Jews.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
3:11	sz4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠כֶּ֖סֶף נָת֣וּן לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	You can say this with an active form. This could mean one of the following things: (1) “You can keep the money from plundering the Jews for yourself.” (2) “I give you permission to take the money from the Jews and to give it to the men just as you have said.” (3) “You do not need to pay for the expenses of the plan yourself.” (4) This statement by the king may also be a formal and cultural way of expressing gratitude for the promised money without actually releasing Haman from paying the money into the treasury. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:11	abm2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הָ⁠עָ֕ם לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת בּ֖⁠וֹ כַּ⁠טּ֥וֹב בְּ⁠עֵינֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. The king is telling Haman that **he can do whatever he wants to the Jews**. Alternate translation: “you can do to the Jews as you see fit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	hx6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּקָּרְאוּ֩ סֹפְרֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	You can say this with an active form. You can also say who did the action. It was most likely Haman, since the king had given him authority to act on his behalf. So you could say, “Haman called in the royal scribes.” Alternate translation: “the king summoned his scribes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:12	t6qa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	בַּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֗וֹן בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֨ה עָשָׂ֣ר יוֹם֮ בּ⁠וֹ֒	1	You can add “of that same year” to show that Haman did this right after Ahasuerus agreed to his plan. Alternate translation: “on the thirteenth day of the first month” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
3:12	abm3			בַּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֗וֹן בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֨ה עָשָׂ֣ר יוֹם֮ בּ⁠וֹ֒	1	You can put this information first because it places the event within the timeline of the story.
3:12	abm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּכָּתֵ֣ב כְּֽ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֣ה הָמָ֡ן	1	You can say this with an active form. You can also say who did the action. Alternate translation: “and Haman dictated a letter to them” or “they wrote a decree containing all that Haman had commanded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:12	abm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנֵֽי־הַ֠⁠מֶּלֶךְ	1	This seems to mean the officials of the king who served in the palace in the capital city, since they are distinguished from the provincial governors and the leaders of the people groups. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:12	j23r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מְדִינָ֣ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֗ה	1	This expression means every province**.** See how you translated this in 1:22. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

3:12	abm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מְדִינָ֤ה וּ⁠מְדִינָה֙ כִּ⁠כְתָבָ֔⁠הּ	1	The implication is that the scribes translated the letter and sent it to each province using its own alphabet.

3:12	j31r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַ֥ם וָ⁠עָ֖ם כִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated this expression in [1:22](../01/22.md). Alternate translation: “and to each people group in its own language” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:12	j33r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	Here, **tongue** is a metonym meaning the language spoken by a person or a group of people. Alternate translation: “according to its language” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:12	abm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֨ם הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֹשׁ֙ נִכְתָּ֔ב	1	There are two This could mean: (1) Here, **name** could mean the authority of the king. This would be saying that Haman’s letter had the same authority as it would have had if the king had sent it himself. Alternate translation: “Haman sent the letter under the king’s own authority” (2) However, this could also mean that Haman actually had the scribes sign the king’s name to the letter. Alternate translation: “they signed the king’s name at the end of the letters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	lyf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִכְתָּ֔ב וְ⁠נֶחְתָּ֖ם בְּ⁠טַבַּ֥עַת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “to show that he was sending the letter under the king’s own authority, Haman sealed each copy of the letter with the ring that had the king’s official seal on it,” or “the scribes signed the king’s name at the end of the letters. Then they sealed the letters with wax, and stamped the wax by using the king’s ring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:13	hxx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִשְׁל֨וֹחַ סְפָרִ֜ים	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. For example, you can say, “couriers delivered the letters.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:13	j34r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠יַ֣ד הָ⁠רָצִים֮	1	Here, **hand** could mean two different things: (1) It could literally mean “hand,” meaning that the couriers carried the letters in their hands. Alternate translation: “couriers hand-delivered the documents” (2) “Hand” could also be a metaphor for power, control, or authority, meaning that couriers were the ones who delivered the letters to all the provinces throughout the empire. Alternate translation: “couriers gave the documents directly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:13	abn0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶל־כָּל־מְדִינ֣וֹת הַ⁠מֶּלֶךְ֒	1	Haman did not send the letters to the provinces (the geographical territories) themselves. Rather, he sent them to the officials in every province in the empire. The story is using the word “province” to refer figuratively to these officials by something associated with them, the territories they ruled. Your translation should make clear that the letters were sent to people, not places. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:13	xs6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֡יד לַ⁠הֲרֹ֣ג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֣ד	1	These words mean the same thing. They are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction that is envisioned. You could combine them as UST does and say something like “completely destroy.” (A “doublet” can use more than two words. See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:13	abn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	מִ⁠נַּ֨עַר וְ⁠עַד־זָקֵ֜ן	1	This is a figure of speech that figuratively describes all of something by naming two extreme parts of it in order to include everything in between. You could express its meaning as UST does and say something like “every single one of them.” Alternate translation: “including young people and old people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
3:13	abn2			טַ֤ף וְ⁠נָשִׁים֙	1	Alternate translation: “including the children and the women”

3:13	abn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֥ה עָשָׂ֛ר	1	Implicitly, this means “the thirteenth day of the twelfth month of that same year.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

3:13	i5ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	הוּא־חֹ֣דֶשׁ אֲדָ֑ר	1	This is the name of the twelfth month of the Hebrew calendar. See how you decided in 2:16 and 3:7 to express dates that the story gives according to the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
3:13	pbp1			וּ⁠שְׁלָלָ֖⁠ם לָ⁠בֽוֹז	1	This means that the letters also said that those who killed the Jews could take everything that belonged to them.

3:14	vga2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠כָל־מְדִינָ֣ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֔ה	1	This expression means each and every province. See how you translated the term “province” in 1:1. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

3:15	abn4			הָֽ⁠רָצִ֞ים יָצְא֤וּ דְחוּפִים֙ בִּ⁠דְבַ֣ר הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	This means that the king had commanded the couriers to deliver the letters as quickly as possible.

Alternate translation: “as the king had commanded, couriers rushed the letters to every province in the empire” or “then, according to what the king commanded, men riding horses took these letters quickly to every province in the empire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:15	i12c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הַ⁠דָּ֥ת נִתְּנָ֖ה	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. For example, you can say, “People read the letter out loud” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:15	nlk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֣ן הַ⁠בִּירָ֑ה	1	Here this likely means in the “capital city of Susa.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:15	abn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יָשְׁב֣וּ לִ⁠שְׁתּ֔וֹת	1	(1) This could mean that Ahasuerus and Haman had more than just a drink together. This could be a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to mean the whole thing. They may have celebrated with an entire banquet that is being described here by reference to one part of it, the drinks. Alternate translation: “had a celebration feast together” (2) Another possibility is that this is describing a toast that Ahasuerus and Haman shared to celebrate their plan. “Sat down” would simply be describing how the men would have reclined at a table to drink. Alternate translation: “had a celebration toast” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
3:15	wm4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נָבֽוֹכָה	1	The implication is that the people in Susa were very upset about what was going to happen and they did not know what to do about it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:15	wbgv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠הָ⁠עִ֥יר	1	The author wants us to see the contrast between the king and Haman sitting down to relax and drink and the people in the city agitated and in an uproar over what the king and Haman had proclaimed. Use a connecting word or other way that your language uses to show a contrast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:15	abn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠הָ⁠עִ֥יר שׁוּשָׁ֖ן	1	This does not mean the city itself, but the people who live there. This is a figure of speech in which something is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. So this means “everyone who lived in Susa” or the people in Susa (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:15	abn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	נָבֽוֹכָה	1	You can translate the abstract noun **confusion** with a verbal phrase such as “was very confused.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

4:1	abo0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּצֵא֙ בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	The next verse shows that Mordecai was heading towards the king’s palace. You could say that explicitly here. Mordecai might have wanted to call attention to the danger that the Jews were in by going to a public location where people were used to seeing him. Or he might have wanted to contact Esther and ask her to help with the trouble. Or he might have wanted both. Alternate translation: “he started walking towards the city center, towards the king’s palace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:1	abo1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַ⁠יִּזְעַ֛ק זְעָקָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה וּ⁠מָרָֽה	1	**Great** and **bitter** are two words that refer to the same thing and that work together.

4:2	abo2			וַ⁠יָּב֕וֹא	1	**He** means Mordecai. Alternate translation: “Mordecai came”

4:2	abo3			שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	See how you translated this in [2:19](../02/19.md). Alternate translation: “the gate to the king’s palace”

4:3	e73y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־מְדִינָ֣ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֗ה	1	This expression means in every single province. See how you translated the term “province” in 1:1.

4:3	e7zx			אֵ֤בֶל גָּדוֹל֙ לַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔ים	1	Alternate translation: “the Jews mourned greatly” or “when the Jews heard about it, they mourned greatly”

So this phrase means something like “those both near and far.” Esther is using a figure of speech to refer to something by speaking of two extreme parts of it in order to include everything in between those parts.

4:11	abr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שַׁרְבִ֥יט הַ⁠זָּהָ֖ב	1	A scepter was an ornamental staff or wand that rulers carried or held as a symbol of their authority.

If she goes without being summoned, she could be put to death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:11	j49r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י	1	This expression indicates a contrast between Esther’s present situation and the situation she has just described. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:11	abr5			זֶ֖ה שְׁלוֹשִׁ֥ים יֽוֹם	1	The phrase means that Esther has not been called in the king’s presence for a period of at least 30 days. You could use an equivalent expression in your language that would indicate this is a long enough time that Esther has reason to believe the king is not interested in seeing her. Alternate translation: “in over a month”
4:11	gv1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	זֶ֖ה שְׁלוֹשִׁ֥ים יֽוֹם	1	Alternate translation: “thirty days” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
4:12	abr6			וַ⁠יַּגִּ֣ידוּ לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֔י	1	From this point on, the author focuses only on Mordecai and Esther and does not specify who the messenger is.

They are used together to emphasize the great emotion behind being delivered from this great evil. If it works better in your language, you can use one word instead of two, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:14	abs0			וְ⁠אַ֥תְּ וּ⁠בֵית־אָבִ֖י⁠ךְ תֹּאבֵ֑דוּ	1	The implication is that the Jews will be rescued starting in that other place, but the ones living in Susa will still be in danger because no one who could have helped them there (such as Esther) would have done anything.

5:3	abt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מַה־לָּ֖⁠ךְ אֶסְתֵּ֣ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֑ה וּ⁠מַה־בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ	1	These two phrases mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is very interested in hearing why Esther has come to see him. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if it would be more natural in your language to combine them into one. Alternate translation: “What do you want, Queen Esther?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
5:3	j61r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠יִנָּ֥תֵֽן לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	This was probably a formal and customary expression in the Persian royal court, meant to show honor to the person making a request of the king and to indicate the king’s willingness to be very generous when answering the request. King Ahasuerus was almost certainly not offering to give Esther half of his kingdom. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is.” Alternate translation: “I will give you what you want, even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
5:3	c6h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יִנָּ֥תֵֽן לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for” or “I will give you what you want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	abt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב	1	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in 1:19 and 3:9. Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:4	m3uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב	1	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “if it seems like a good idea to you, O king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
5:4	j63r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יָב֨וֹא הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ וְ⁠הָמָן֙	1	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “O king, please come with Haman” or “you and Haman come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
5:4	abt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֥יתִי לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “the banquet that I have prepared for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
5:4	abu0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֥יתִי לֽ⁠וֹ	1	If you decide to translate this as “the banquet that I have prepared for you,” then the word “you” should be singular, since here it refers just to the king. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
5:5	abu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	The king would have said this to his servants, not to Esther. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The king said to his servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:5	abu2			מַהֲרוּ֙ אֶת־הָמָ֔ן לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת אֶת־דְּבַ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֑ר	1	The **word of Esther** means her invitation to the banquet. Alternate translation: “go and get Haman and bring him quickly to the banquet that Esther has prepared”
5:5	abu3			עָשְׂתָ֥ה	1	Alternate translation: “had prepared for them”
5:6	d5wr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֖⁠ךְ וְ⁠יִנָּ֣תֵֽן לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ⁠מַה־בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	These two question-and-statement pairs mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice in slightly different ways to show that he is truly disposed to give Esther whatever she wants. If this is confusing, you do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation. you can combine them into one or replace the repetition with a statement of what the repetition means, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “now please tell me what you really want. I will do it for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
5:6	pj3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֖⁠ךְ וְ⁠יִנָּ֣תֵֽן לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ⁠מַה־בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	When Ahasuerus asked Esther in the throne room what she wanted, she said that she wanted him and Haman to come to a banquet she had prepared. But since the king asks her once again at the banquet what she wants, it is clear that he knew this was not her real request. Instead, he knew that she wanted to show him hospitality first, as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship. You can indicate this by translating, “Now please tell me what you really want.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:6	q5nt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֖⁠ךְ & בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ	1	The two abstract nouns **petition** and **request** can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “what you really want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:6	e2v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יִנָּ֣תֵֽן & וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	You can capture these parallel passive statements with one statement using an active form. Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:6	j65r			עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת	1	See how you translated this expression in [5:3](../05/03.md). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is”
5:7	abu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠תַּ֥עַן & וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֑ר	1	Here a single idea is being expressed by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words mean that Esther responded to the question that the king asked her. Alternate translation: “answered” or “replied” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
5:7	r4aw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	שְׁאֵלָתִ֖⁠י וּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י	1	The words **petition** and **request** mean the same thing. Esther probably used these words together as a way of speaking very formally and respectfully to the king. Alternate translation: “this is what I want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:7	abu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְׁאֵלָתִ֖⁠י וּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י	1	The two abstract nouns **petition** and **request** can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “this is what I want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:8	c2br		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֜ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	The expression **find favor** means to gain the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:8	abu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֜ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. The phrase means the King Ahasuerus is pleased with Esther and willing to grant her request. Alternate translation: “if the king evaluates me and approves” or “if the king is pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:8	c2jy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֜ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
5:8	abu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ ט֔וֹב	1	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in [1:19](../01/19.md), [3:9](../03/09.md), and [5:4](../05/04.md). Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:8	j69r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	לָ⁠תֵת֙ אֶת־שְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔⁠י וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת אֶת־בַּקָּשָׁתִ֑⁠י	1	The phrases **to grant my petition** and **to perform my request** mean the same thing. Alternate translation: “to do what I want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:8	x8hf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יָב֧וֹא הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ וְ⁠הָמָ֗ן אֶל־הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֣ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “please come with Haman to another banquet that I will prepare for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
5:8	j71r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	יָב֧וֹא הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ וְ⁠הָמָ֗ן אֶל־הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֣ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	If you decide to translate this as “the banquet that I have prepared for you,” then the word “you” should be dual if your language uses that form, since it refers to the king and Haman, otherwise it should be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
5:8	abu9			וּ⁠מָחָ֥ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֖ה כִּ⁠דְבַ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	The **word of the king** means his request for Esther to tell him what she wants. Alternate translation: “I will answer your question then”
5:8	gf9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	כִּ⁠דְבַ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “according to your word” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

5:9	j73r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	שָׂמֵ֖חַ וְ⁠ט֣וֹב לֵ֑ב	1	The word **joyful** and the phrase **good of heart** mean the same thing. These terms are used together to show that Haman was very happy after attending Esther’s banquet with King Ahasuerus. Alternate translation: “feeling very good” [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]
5:9	j75r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠ט֣וֹב לֵ֑ב	1	Here, **heart** figuratively represents the action of thinking or feeling. The phrase means that Haman felt happy. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:9	dkg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹא־קָם֙	1	Under other circumstances, officials were expected to bow low to the ground to show respect for Haman. See [3:2](../03/02.md). But since Mordecai was already sitting on the ground as a sign of mourning, he would have been expected to stand up to show respect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Mordecai did not stand up to show respect for Haman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:9	j77r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠לֹא־זָ֣ע מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	The phrase means that Mordecai was not afraid of Haman or of what Haman might do to him for refusing to show the respect that the king had commanded. Alternate translation: “or tremble fearfully in front of him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
5:9	s47u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֥א הָמָ֛ן עַֽל־מָרְדֳּכַ֖י חֵמָֽה	1	Here, **Haman’s rage** is described as something that could fill him up. See how you translated this expression in [3:5](../03/05.md). Alternate translation: “Haman became very angry because of Mordecai” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:10	v5nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יִּתְאַפַּ֣ק הָמָ֔ן	1	There is a contrast between this sentence and the previous one. Haman felt very much like doing one thing, but he decided it would be better to do something else. The contrast can be indicated with a phrase such as “but even though.” Alternate translation: “but even though Haman was so angry, he kept himself from losing his temper” or “Haman refused to show how angry he was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:10	bcn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	זֶ֥רֶשׁ	1	This is a woman’s name. It occurs several times in this chapter and the next. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
5:11	abv4			וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֨ר לָ⁠הֶ֥ם	1	Alternate translation: “then … made a long speech to them about”
5:11	mvm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כְּב֥וֹד עָשְׁר֖⁠וֹ	1	**Glory** and **wealth** are both abstract nouns. Alternate translation: “Haman told them about how great his wealth was” or “Haman told them about the many great things he owned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:11	j79r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠רֹ֣ב בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	Having many sons was probably seen as a mark of honor and status in Persian culture. This phrase probably means that Haman was boasting about the status he enjoyed in Persian society because he had many sons. Alternate translation: “how many sons he had” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
5:11	abv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	This word can sometimes be used in Hebrew to mean both male and female children. However, here it clearly refers to male children, so you should translate it that way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
5:11	m7fq			גִּדְּל֤⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: “how the king had continually given him more authority” or “how the king had honored him many times by giving him more important work”
5:11	b7c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נִשְּׂא֔⁠וֹ עַל	1	Here, **lifting** is a metaphor meaning to “advance” or “promote” a person to a higher, more important position than they had previously. Alternate translation: “given him a position more important than” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:11	abv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים וְ⁠עַבְדֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	This means all of the others, as [3:1](../03/01.md) makes clear. Alternate translation: “all of his other officials and administrators” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:11	xwvh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים וְ⁠עַבְדֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	The words **officials** and **administrators** mean similar things. If your language uses one word for these, you can combine them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:12	abv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אַ֣ף	1	You can translate it as an exclamation because Haman believes he has saved the best for last and is now introducing what he considers to be his most recent significant honor. Alternate translation: “and that is not all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
5:12	w1bm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹא־הֵבִיאָה֩ אֶסְתֵּ֨ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֧ה עִם־הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ & כִּ֣י אִם־אוֹתִ֑⁠י	1	This can be expressed positively. Alternate translation: “I was the only one Queen Esther invited besides the king” or “Queen Esther invited just two of us, the king and me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
5:12	abv8			עָשָׂ֖תָה	1	Alternate translation: “she had prepared”
5:12	abv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠גַם־לְ⁠מָחָ֛ר אֲנִ֥י קָֽרוּא־לָ֖⁠הּ עִם־הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “and she has invited me to attend another banquet with the king again tomorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:13	abw0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠כָל־זֶ֕ה אֵינֶ֥⁠נּוּ שֹׁוֶ֖ה לִ֑⁠י בְּ⁠כָל־עֵ֗ת אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֲנִ֤י רֹאֶה֙	1	This is a figurative way of speaking. It is as if Haman is weighing his happiness on one side of a scale and his unhappiness on the other side. Haman is saying that his happiness over all the honors he has received is still not greater than his unhappiness over seeing Mordecai fail to honor him, so on balance, he is unhappy. Alternate translation: “I still cannot be happy as long as I keep seeing” or “all of this does not make me happy” or “ … does not satisfy me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:13	wu84			וְ⁠כָל־זֶ֕ה	1	Haman is continuing to speak here. You can show this by beginning with “Then Haman said.”
5:13	abw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔י	1	This phrase gives clarifying information about Mordecai. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
5:13	abw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Haman could be referring to the way Mordecai has been refusing to stand up to honor him, or he could be referring generally to the way Mordecai has never honored him (by either bowing or standing up) ever since he was appointed to a position in the king’s service and stationed at the gate. Either way, being reminded of this dishonor is the reason why Haman continues to be unhappy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “sitting at the citadel gate and refusing to honor me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:13	abw3			בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Alternate translation: “the citadel gate”
5:14	abw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר ל⁠וֹ֩ זֶ֨רֶשׁ אִשְׁתּ֜⁠וֹ וְ⁠כָל־אֹֽהֲבָ֗י⁠ו	1	The verb is feminine, so it is Zeresh who is speaking here. By mentioning the friends, it is implied that they are in agreement with what she says. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say, “Then Haman’s wife Zeresh suggested, and his friends agreed.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:14	j81r			וְ⁠כָל־אֹֽהֲבָ֗י⁠ו	1	This means the friends whom Haman had invited to his home that day. Alternate translation: “his friends who were there”

5:14	i2f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עֵץ֮	1	See how you translated this in [2:23](../02/23.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Be sure your translation is consistent in the chapters that follow. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
5:14	k8zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance	גָּבֹ֣הַּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים אַמָּה֒	1	You can convert this to a modern measure if that is the style of translation that you are using. Alternate translation: “seventy-five feet high” or “twenty-five meters high” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
5:14	hiui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֱמֹ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ וְ⁠יִתְל֤וּ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַי֙ עָלָ֔י⁠ו	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what Haman would say to the king. Alternate translation: “speak to the king and tell him that you would like to hang Mordecai on it” or “tell the king that you intend to hang Mordecai on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:14	abw7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יִתְל֤וּ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַי֙ עָלָ֔י⁠ו	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit who does the action. Probably, Haman’s servants would carry out the action. But since it would happen under Haman’s orders and perhaps under his supervision, you could also describe him as the one who does the action if that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and have your servants hang Mordecai on it” or “and hang Mordecai on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:14	abw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠בֹֽא & אֶל הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה שָׂמֵ֑חַ	1	**Then** indicates more than a time sequence here. Zeresh and the friends are saying what the result would be. Alternate translation: “after he is dead, you will be able to go to the banquet … in a good mood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:14	bbs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּיטַ֧ב הַ⁠דָּבָ֛ר לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן	1	The **word** was the suggestion that Zeresh and the friends made. Here, **face** figuratively represents Haman himself by something associated with him, his face, which showed what he was thinking and feeling. Alternate translation: “Haman decided that he liked this idea” or “that suggestion pleased Haman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:14	i8is			וַ⁠יַּ֥עַשׂ הָ⁠עֵֽץ	1	Haman most likely did not do this personally. He ordered it to be done. Alternate translation: “he gave his servants orders to set up the pole” or “he told his servants to construct the gallows”
5:14	j83r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הָ⁠עֵֽץ	1	See how you translated this in [2:23](../02/23.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Be sure your translation is consistent in the chapters that follow. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:intro	i9x7				0	# Esther 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of Haman’s fall.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Approaching the king\nIt was not possible for a person to easily approach the king. Normally, access to him was very limited. There are several events in this chapter which show the layers of protection surrounding the king.
6:1	j85r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	בַּ⁠לַּ֣יְלָה הַ⁠ה֔וּא	1	This introduces a new event in the story. Use a natural way of introducing a new event in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
6:1	abw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	נָדְדָ֖ה שְׁנַ֣ת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	Here, **sleep** is spoken of as if it were a living thing that could flee away. Alternate translation: “the king could not sleep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
6:1	abx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר לְ⁠הָבִ֞יא	1	**He** means the king. The implication is that he told the young men who attended him to do this. Verses 3 and 5 indicate this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “so he commanded his servants to fetch” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:1	abx2			סֵ֤פֶר הַ⁠זִּכְרֹנוֹת֙ דִּבְרֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּמִ֔ים	1	This is equivalent to the expression “the book of the events of days” in [2:23](../02/23.md). See how you translated that expression. Alternate translation: “the royal chronicles” or “the records of what had happened during all the time that he had been king”
6:1	abx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּהְי֥וּ נִקְרָאִ֖ים	1	This means that the chronicles were read out loud. You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action.

6:2	u4gi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּמָּצֵ֣א כָת֗וּב	1	Both terms **found** and **recorded** can be expressed in active form.

6:2	abx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִגִּ֨יד מָרְדֳּכַ֜י עַל	1	The implication is that Mordecai had saved the king’s life by discovering the plot and telling him about it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Mordecai had saved the king’s life by discovering a plot against the king and telling him about it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:2	abx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	הִגִּ֨יד מָרְדֳּכַ֜י עַל	1	To relate the events in chronological order, you can put this at the end of the verse.

6:2	abx7			מִ⁠שֹּׁמְרֵ֖י הַ⁠סַּ֑ף	1	See how you translated this expression in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “who protected the doorway to the king’s private quarters”
6:2	abx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּקְשׁוּ֙	1	Here, **seeking** figuratively means actively trying to do something. Alternate translation: “they had planned” or “they had tried” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:2	j89r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֣חַ יָ֔ד	1	As in [2:21](../02/21.md), the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this by putting the terms together. For example, you could say, “What great honor was done for Mordecai?” Alternate translation: “what did we do to reward Mordecai or to show that we appreciated what he did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
6:3	aby0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נַּעֲשָׂ֞ה	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “what did I do” or “what did we do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

However, it would be good to say this in a way that does not create the impression that the young men are accusing the king. Alternate translation: “no one did anything for him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:3	aby1			עַל־זֶ֑ה	1	Alternate translation: “for saving my life”
6:4	aby2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ֣י בֶ⁠חָצֵ֑ר	1	This could mean either: (1) The king knows that there is someone in the courtyard, maybe because he heard someone walking there; he wants to know who it is. (2) Since there are always people around the palace, the king assumes that there must be someone out in the courtyard. In either case, the king wants to know if there is someone there with whom he could consult about the best way to honor Mordecai. As the story has already said in [1:13](../01/13.md), it was the king’s habit to consult his advisors on important questions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king wanted to consult someone about the best way to honor Mordecai, so he asked, ‘who is in the courtyard’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:4	aby3			מִ֣י בֶ⁠חָצֵ֑ר	1	In order to present the events in logical and chronological order, you can put the king’s question last in the verse if that would be more natural in your language. Haman had already come in the courtyard by the time the king asked this question.

If it would be helpful in your language, you can say so. Alternate translation: “the young men who served the king looked and saw that Haman was in the courtyard. They said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:5	j93r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִנֵּ֥ה	1	This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation. You could also have the young men address the king directly to get his attention. Alternate translation: “O king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:5	j95r			יָבֽוֹא	1	Alternate translation: “he may come in”

6:6	jh4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר הָמָן֙ בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Here, **heart** could mean two different things: (1) Heart could figuratively represent the action of thinking or feeling. In that case, the phrase would mean “then Haman said in his thoughts.” (2) Heart could also be a metaphor meaning to be inside someone or something. In that case, the phrase would mean “then Haman said inside himself.” Either way, the phrase means that Haman was not saying this out loud, but saying it to himself in his thoughts. Alternate translation: “Haman thought to himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:6	yft1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לְ⁠מִ֞י יַחְפֹּ֥ץ הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת יְקָ֖ר יוֹתֵ֥ר מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי	1	Haman is actually making a statement to himself rather than asking a question and trying to figure out the answer. He uses a question form to emphasize how true he believes the statement to be. If it would be helpful in your language, instead of a question, you could use a statement such as, “Surely there is no one whom the king would take pleasure in honoring more than me!” Alternate translation: “whom would the king like to honor more than me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

6:8	mz79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָבִ֨יאוּ֙	1	The implication is that the king’s servants would do this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly.

6:8	aby7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְב֣וּשׁ מַלְכ֔וּת אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָֽבַשׁ־בּ֖⁠וֹ הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to anything that belongs to the king. You can translate this idea with an adjective, “a royal garment.” Alternate translation: “one of your own royal robes that you have already worn yourself” or “one of the robes you wear to show that you are the king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:8	aby8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָֽבַשׁ־בּ֖⁠וֹ הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect.

6:8	abz0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִתַּ֛ן כֶּ֥תֶר מַלְכ֖וּת בְּ⁠רֹאשֽׁ⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that this would be done to show that this was one of the king’s own horses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and that has a royal crown on its head to show that it belongs to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:8	abz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כֶּ֥תֶר מַלְכ֖וּת	1	**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate this idea with an adjective, “a royal crown.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:9	pp3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נָת֨וֹן הַ⁠לְּב֜וּשׁ וְ⁠הַ⁠סּ֗וּס עַל־יַד־אִ֞ישׁ מִ⁠שָּׂרֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	Here, **hand** is a metaphor meaning power, control, or authority. It appears that the king himself would not perform such acts of service to one of his subjects even if he really wanted to honor that person. So Haman is saying that on behalf of the king, representing his authority and power, one of the king’s most noble officials should present the man with the robe and the horse. Alternate translation: “then, on your behalf, have one of your most noble officials present the man with the robe and the horse” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

6:9	abz4			בִּ⁠רְח֣וֹב הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	This refers to a large, open space in the city, either the space that was in front of the palace (as in [4:6](../04/06.md)), or a space inside one of the city gates. In either case, this would have been a public area where people could gather, and so it was a place where a great number of people would have seen how the king was honoring Mordecai. Alternate translation: “through the public square of the city”
6:9	qs3k			וְ⁠קָרְא֣וּ	1	Alternate translation: “and tell the noble official and servants to proclaim” or “and have them shout out”
6:9	j1d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנָ֔י⁠ו	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase means that the servants were to shout out to the people in front of the man on the horse, that is, to the people who were in the path of his horse as it approached. Alternate translation: “to whoever is in front of them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:9	j1d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּ֚כָה יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה לָ⁠אִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֥ץ בִּ⁠יקָרֽ⁠וֹ	1	**To delight** in doing something means to be glad to do something or to want to do something.

Alternate translation: “one of my servants, who is stationed at the king’s gate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:10	abz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הַ⁠יּוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	Here the king speaks of himself in the third person.

6:10	gln7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַל־תַּפֵּ֣ל דָּבָ֔ר	1	Here the action of letting **fall** is a metaphor meaning to leave out or leave unfulfilled.

6:11	j2d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֣א לְ⁠פָנָ֔י⁠ו	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase means that Haman shouted out to the people in front of Mordecai, that is, the people who were in the path of his horse as it approached. Alternate translation: “called out to all of the people in front of him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Haman wanted Mordecai to bow down in front of him. But instead, the story would be saying that Haman is starting to bow down (in a metaphorical sense) in front of Mordecai. Alternate translation: “Mordecai has begun to humiliate you. If he … ” (2) “Fall” could be a figurative way of saying “be killed in battle.” In that case, Zeresh would be comparing Haman and Mordecai to two soldiers who are fighting. She is saying that Haman has already “begun to fall,” that is, he is losing the battle, and he is likely to be killed. Alternate translation: “Mordecai has begun to defeat you. Since he … ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:13	j3d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person.

Alternate translation: “one of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:13	nan5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹא־תוּכַ֣ל ל֔⁠וֹ	1	Here Haman’s wife and friends are again speaking figuratively as if Haman is in a battle with Mordecai.

Alternate translation: “you will certainly lose to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:13	j3d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase means that Haman will lose in his struggle with Mordecai. Alternate translation: “before him” or “in his presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:14	j4d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	עוֹדָ⁠ם֙ מְדַבְּרִ֣ים עִמּ֔⁠וֹ	1	This phrase indicates something that happened after Haman’s wife and friends started talking with Haman and while they were still talking. You should indicate this with a phrase such as “while.” Alternate translation: “while they were still talking together, the king’s eunuchs arrived” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
6:14	aca4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠סָרִיסֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	See how you decided to translate this term in [1:10](../01/10.md). Not all of the king’s eunuchs came. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: “some of the king’s servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:14	aca5			וַ⁠יַּבְהִ֨לוּ֙ לְ⁠הָבִ֣יא אֶת־הָמָ֔ן	1	Alternative translation: “they wanted to bring Haman quickly”
6:14	aca6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁר־עָשְׂתָ֥ה אֶסְתֵּֽר	1	Esther’s servants would have done most of the work of preparing the banquet. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: “that Esther and her servants had prepared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:intro	x4w3				0	# Esther 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe story of Haman’s fall concludes in this chapter.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Covering Haman’s face\n\nWhen “the servants covered Haman’s face,” they were showing that he had been condemned to be executed. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:1	n8vb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֤א הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ וְ⁠הָמָ֔ן לִ⁠שְׁתּ֖וֹת עִם־אֶסְתֵּ֥ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּֽה	1	Esther hosted Ahasuerus and Haman for more than just drinks. This is a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to mean the whole thing. An entire banquet is being described here by reference to one part of it, the drinks. Alternate translation: “so the king and Haman went to the second banquet that Queen Esther had prepared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:2	xt9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֤וֹם הַ⁠שֵּׁנִי֙	1	This refers to the day after the first banquet, as mentioned in [5:8](../05/08.md). Alternate translation: “at that second banquet” or “on that second day of feasting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
7:2	s5ae			בְּ⁠מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה הַ⁠יַּ֔יִן	1	Alternate translation: “while they were drinking wine” or “while the servants were pouring the wine and giving it to them”
7:2	yks7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ & וְ⁠תִנָּ֣תֵֽן לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ⁠מַה־בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	These two statements mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is truly disposed to giving Esther what she wants. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “now please tell me what you really want. Tell me, and I will do it for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
7:2	p1xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ	1	Ahasuerus has now allowed Esther to show her hospitality at two banquets. But he knows that she has done this as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship, and that this signals that she has an important and urgent request to make. You can indicate this by having the king ask, “Now please tell me what you really want.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:2	sem7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠תִנָּ֣תֵֽן & וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	You can capture these parallel passive statements with one statement using an active form. Alternate translation: “I will give you what you ask for” or “I will do for you what you ask” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:2	j4d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ & בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ	1	The two abstract nouns **petition** and **request** can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “what you really want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:2	j4d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת	1	See how you translated this expression in [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:6](../05/06.md). Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
7:3	ac96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠תַּ֨עַן & וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֔ר	1	Here a single idea is being expressed by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words mean that Esther responded to the question that the king asked her. Alternate translation: “answered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
7:3	k27c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	**Favor** means the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:3	aca7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:3	j4d7			הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	In this case, Esther is addressing Ahasuerus directly as “O king”; she is not speaking about him in the third person as a sign of respect, as she and others usually do elsewhere in the story. This may indicate a special urgency to what she is saying, so it would be good to include this difference in your translation or indicate the urgency in some other way.
7:3	aca8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב	1	This is an idiom that also appears in [1:19](../01/19.md), [3:9](../03/09.md), [5:4](../05/04.md), and [5:8](../05/08.md). The suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good plan to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But here, Esther has just addressed the king directly with “O king” and she is pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people. So an alternate translation here could be something more like, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:3	aca9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	תִּנָּֽתֶן־לִ֤⁠י נַפְשִׁ⁠י֙ בִּ⁠שְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔⁠י וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י בְּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י	1	The phrases **at my petition** and **at my request** mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the urgency of the request. If it would be more natural in your language, you could combine the two requests. Alternate translation: “please spare my life and save my people” or “my request is that you spare my life and the lives of my people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
7:3	j4d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּנָּֽתֶן־לִ֤⁠י נַפְשִׁ⁠י֙	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “please spare my life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:3	bvi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בִּ⁠שְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔⁠י	1	The abstract noun **petition** can be expressed with the verb “ask for.” Alternate translation: “that is what I am asking for” or “that is what I want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:3	qghp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י	1	If this is unclear in your language, you can repeat from the previous clause the words that have been left out. Alternate translation: “and let my people be given to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:3	j5d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י	1	The abstract noun **request** can be expressed with the verb “ask for.” Alternate translation: “rhat is what I am asking for” or “rhat is what I want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:4	acb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֤י נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙	1	As Esther points out later in the verse, the Jews actually have not been exchanged for money. Rather, **sell** is a figurative way of saying “turn over to.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning by saying something like “For someone has turned us over to our enemies.” Alternatively, you could use the same figure, but show that it is a comparison. Alternate translation: “it is as though I and my people are cattle that have been sold to be slaughtered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:4	fhs7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כִּ֤י נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for someone has sold us” or “for someone has put us in danger of our enemies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:4	e9cx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֖יד לַ⁠הֲר֣וֹג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֑ד	1	As in [3:13](../03/13.md), these words mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction. If using three words would be difficult or confusing in your language, you could use one word for this and indicate that the destruction is extreme. Alternate translation: “and they are going to kill every one of us” (A “doublet” can involve the use of more than two words.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:4	yg01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֖יד לַ⁠הֲר֣וֹג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֑ד	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns such as these, you can replace them with one or more verbs. Alternate translation: “and they are going to kill every one of us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:4	acb2			וְ֠⁠אִלּוּ לַ⁠עֲבָדִ֨ים וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁפָח֤וֹת נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙	1	Alternate translation: “if the men and even the women had been sold into slavery”
7:4	j5d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	אֵ֥ין הַ⁠צָּ֛ר שֹׁוֶ֖ה בְּ⁠נֵ֥זֶק הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Esther is speaking very deferentially and with some exaggeration in order to impress on the king how important this is to her. She is saying that it would have been worth less to her to see her people rescued from slavery than it would have been to see the king spared the trouble of intervening on their behalf. (Haman uses the expression of “not equal” in this same sense in [5:13](../05/13.md).) Alternate translation: “that would have been a matter too small to bother you with” or “that would be a small matter to a king like you, but this is very much worse” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
7:4	acb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Esther addresses King Ahasuerus in the third person as a way of showing respect. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
7:5	acb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ & וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	These two words mean the same thing. Alternate translation: “responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:5	acb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מִ֣י ה֥וּא זֶה֙ וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא	1	These two phrases mean similar things. They both ask about the identity of the man who is trying to destroy the Jews. King Ahasuerus uses the repetition to emphasize how outraged he is. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could combine the two phrases. However, from another perspective, both the man’s identity and his location are important to know so that his plot can be stopped. So, for that reason, you could also decide to include both phrases in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
7:5	acb7			מִ֣י ה֥וּא זֶה֙ וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא	1	Alternate translation: “who has done this”
7:5	dl4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא אֲשֶׁר־מְלָא֥⁠וֹ לִבּ֖⁠וֹ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת כֵּֽן	1	Here the concept of a **full heart** uses two metaphors at once. “Heart” figuratively represents the action of thinking or feeling. Also, saying that the “heart” is “full” is a figurative way of saying that someone is fully intending to do something, usually something that should not be done. Alternate translation: “where is the man who is intending to do such a thing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:6	j5d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	צַ֣ר וְ⁠אוֹיֵ֔ב	1	These words mean the same thing. Together, they emphasize Haman’s complete hostility towards the Jews. If it is more natural in your language, you can combine them and indicate the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “the one who is our absolute nemesis” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:6	ar4f			נִבְעַ֔ת	1	Alternative translation: “was extremely afraid”
7:6	j5d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נִבְעַ֔ת מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֥י	1	Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. The phrase means that Haman was now extremely afraid to be in the presence of King Ahasuerus and Queen Esther. Alternate translation: “this made Haman very afraid to be in the presence of the king and the queen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:7	bzd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ קָ֤ם בַּ⁠חֲמָת⁠וֹ֙ מִ⁠מִּשְׁתֵּ֣ה הַ⁠יַּ֔יִן	1	Here, **in his rage** is an idiom meaning to be extremely angry. Alternate translation: “the king was extremely angry and got up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:7	j6d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶל־גִּנַּ֖ת הַ⁠בִּיתָ֑ן	1	The implication is that Ahasuerus went outside to absorb the shock that a man he had promoted to the highest position in his empire was plotting to destroy his queen and her whole people. Ahasuerus needed to sort out his conflicting loyalties and decide what to do about this. If it would be misunderstood, you could say explicitly why he went outside. Alternate translation: “he went outside to the palace garden to decide what to do.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:7	uaq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠בַקֵּ֤שׁ עַל־נַפְשׁ⁠וֹ֙	1	Here, **seeking** figuratively means to beg or plead urgently for something. This phrase means that Haman wanted to beg Esther to persuade the king not to order his execution. Alternate translation: “to plead with Queen Esther to spare his life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:7	qz1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֣י רָאָ֔ה	1	Here, **seeing** is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “he realized” or “he understood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:7	nin1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כָלְתָ֥ה אֵלָ֛י⁠ו הָ⁠רָעָ֖ה מֵ⁠אֵ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the king had decided to cause a disaster against him” or “the king was decided to destroy him” or “the king had decided to kill him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:7	j6d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָלְתָ֥ה אֵלָ֛י⁠ו הָ⁠רָעָ֖ה מֵ⁠אֵ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Here the abstract noun **evil** means “harm,” not something that is morally wrong as in the previous verse. In this context, it can be expressed with a verb such as “execute.” Alternate translation: “the king was likely to execute him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:8	j6d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ שָׁב֩ & וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל	1	The implication is that when the king returned to the room, he saw what this verse describes next. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when the king returned … , he saw that Haman had fallen … ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:8	h4c7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	The implication is that Haman was doing this as he pleaded for his life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could add that information to the end of this phrase: “ … as he was begging Esther to spare his life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:8	acb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	If you prefer to present the events in chronological order, you can put this information first in the verse. See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
7:8	acb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	The expression **was fallen** means that as Haman was begging for his life, he was not standing up; he had suddenly come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a couch. (From the impression that the king got when he returned, it is possible that Haman was even grabbing her arms or shoulders as he pleaded with Esther.) Alternate translation: “Haman had come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a banqueting couch” or “Haman had thrown himself down on the couch where Esther was reclining” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:8	acc0			הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	In this culture, especially at a banquet like this one, wealthy people would recline on couches as they ate and drank. Alternate translation: “Esther’s banqueting couch”
7:8	thq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ֠⁠גַם לִ⁠כְבּ֧וֹשׁ אֶת־הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֛ה עִמִּ֖⁠י בַּ⁠בָּ֑יִת	1	The king phrases this as a question to show his shock and anger at what he thinks Haman is doing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could phrase it as a statement. Alternate translation: “he is even trying to rape the queen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:8	l4ce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	לִ⁠כְבּ֧וֹשׁ אֶת־הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֛ה	1	The story is using a mild expression to refer to something that is disturbing. In this context, “subdue” means “rape.” The king thought that Haman was trying to rape Esther, and he likely said just that. You can show this in your translation if you want to make this clear. Alternate translation: “trying to rape the queen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
7:8	acc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	עִמִּ֖⁠י בַּ⁠בָּ֑יִת	1	These two phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the idea that they are expressing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. However, each one does indicate something slightly different about what a serious offense it would be if Haman actually were trying to rape Esther. It would be a violation of the king’s personal trust and a violation of the trust implicit in hospitality. So you could also include both phrases. Alternate translation: “in my presence and in my own house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
7:8	adq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הַ⁠דָּבָ֗ר יָצָא֙ מִ⁠פִּ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	This expression describes the action of speaking. Alternate translation: “as soon as the king said this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:8	acc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	הַ⁠דָּבָ֗ר & וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ	1	The king spoke, and then the servants covered Haman’s face. One action followed upon another. However, this happened so quickly that almost no time seemed to pass in between. You can indicate this with a phrase like “as soon as.” Alternate translation: “when the king said this, immediately they covered Haman’s face” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
7:8	j6d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ	1	The implication is that some the king’s servants who were present did this, and they did it because they understood that the king wanted Haman to be executed. Alternate translation: “some of his servants covered Haman’s face because he was going to be executed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:8	acc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ	1	**Covering the face** in this culture, as in many others, was a sign that a person had been condemned to death. Alternate translation: “some of his servants covered Haman’s face to show that he would be executed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
7:9	a7ic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	חַ֠רְבוֹנָה	1	This is a man’s name. See how you translated it in [1:10](../01/10.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
7:9	j7d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶחָ֨ד מִן־הַ⁠סָּרִיסִ֜ים לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. This phrase means that Harbona was one of the eunuchs who served King Ahasuerus personally. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:9	acc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠סָּרִיסִ֜ים לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	See how you translated this term and this phrase in [1:10](../01/10.md). Alternate translation: “the guardians who served the king personally” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:9	j7d3			הִנֵּה	1	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, it can be omitted from your translation. But consider using an expression that is natural in your language for someone to address the king directly to get his attention. For example, you could say, “O king!”
7:9	acc5			גַּ֣ם & הָ⁠עֵ֣ץ אֲשֶׁר־עָשָׂ֪ה הָמָ֟ן לְֽ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֞י & עֹמֵד֙ בְּ⁠בֵ֣ית הָמָ֔ן	1	Alternate translation:“Haman has also set up a pole [or gallows] at his house because he wants to impale [or hang] Mordecai on it”
7:9	j7d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הָ⁠עֵ֣ץ	1	See how you translated this in [2:23](../02/23.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Be sure your translation is consistent in the chapters that follow. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:9	j7d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְֽ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֞י אֲשֶׁ֧ר דִּבֶּר־ט֣וֹב עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	This expression means that Mordecai said something that benefitted the king. Specifically, Mordecai reported an assassination plot and saved the king’s life. Alternate translation: “Mordecai, who saved the king’s life.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:9	j7d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	דִּבֶּר־ט֣וֹב עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	Harbona addresses the king in the third person as a way of showing respect. Alternate translation: “saved your life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
7:9	acc6			עֹמֵד֙	1	Alternate translation: “is set up”
7:9	sre1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance	גָּבֹ֖הַּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים אַמָּ֑ה	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could convert this to a modern measure. See how you translated this phrase in [5:14](../05/14.md). Alternate translation: “seventy-five feet high” or “twenty-five meters high” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
7:9	acc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תְּלֻ֥⁠הוּ עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	**Him** means Haman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “hang [or impale] Haman on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:10	j8d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	See how you translated this in [2:23](../02/23.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Be sure your translation is consistent in the chapters that follow. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:10	umd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠חֲמַ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ שָׁכָֽכָה	1	Here the story figuratively compares the king’s anger to floodwaters, which can cause great destruction. “Subside” means for waters to drain away and for their level to go down. You could express the meaning by saying something like “Then the king’s rage lessened,” or “Then the king was not so angry.” Or you could use a different metaphor that would be meaningful in your language, such as, “Then the king cooled off.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:intro	z6j7				0	# Esther 8 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s protection\nYahweh is at work in this chapter preventing the possible destruction of the Jews. God used Esther and Mordecai to protect their people.
8:1	j8d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֗וּא	1	This could mean one of three things: (1) A new series of events is now being described, but the story makes clear that they happened on the same day as the second banquet. While it must have been some time later in the day, the idea is that when Haman lost his life, and also his property, Esther gained what her enemy had lost. Alternate translation: “that same day” (2) The expression could also be an idiom that means “as of that day.” This would refer to the effective date for the transfer of Haman’s property to Esther. Alternate translation: “as of that day” (3) The term “day” could also be used figuratively to mean around the same time. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:1	j8d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נָתַ֞ן הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֣ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֔ה אֶת־בֵּ֥ית הָמָ֖ן	1	Here, **house** figuratively represents all the household and property of Haman. The story could be referring to all the property by naming one part of it, the house. Or “house” could be a metonym for “property,” meaning everything a person owns and keeps in their house, and by extension everything they own beyond the house as well. Alternate translation: “King Ahasuerus declared that everything that Haman had owned would now belong to Queen Esther” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
8:1	nm3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	צֹרֵ֣ר הַיְּהוּדִ֑ים	1	This phrase gives clarifying information about Haman. Alternate translation: “the enemy of the Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
8:1	acc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֗י בָּ֚א לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	The implication is that when the king learned how Mordecai was related to Esther, he summoned Mordecai into his presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he learned that, the king sent for Mordecai to come into his presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:1	j8d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person.

Alternate translation: “Esther told the king how Mordecai was related to her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
8:1	j9d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִגִּ֥ידָה אֶסְתֵּ֖ר מַ֥ה הוּא־לָֽ⁠הּ	1	Esther told this to the king. She would likely have explained not just how she and Mordecai were related, but that he had raised her after her parents died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Esther told the king that Mordecai was her cousin and that he had been like a father to her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:2	m5hz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יָּ֨סַר הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ אֶת־טַבַּעְתּ֗⁠וֹ & וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֑י	1	Giving the ring to Mordecai showed that Mordecai could now act on the king’s own authority, and it enabled him to do that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king now gave this ring to Mordecai to show that Mordecai had the power to act on the authority of the king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
8:2	acd1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	טַבַּעְתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated this in [3:10](../03/10.md). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the ring that had his official seal on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:2	j9d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱבִיר֙ מֵֽ⁠הָמָ֔ן	1	This means that the king had taken back his signet ring from Haman. He would have done this when he sentenced Haman to death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king had given Haman the ring that had his official seal on it, but he had taken it back from Haman when he sentenced Haman to death, and the king was wearing it again.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:2	acd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱבִיר֙ מֵֽ⁠הָמָ֔ן	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this information first in the verse because it happened before everything else. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
8:2	z5yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֑י	1	By giving his signet ring to Mordecai, the king gave Mordecai the authority to write important papers that people would have to obey. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:2	acd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תָּ֧שֶׂם אֶסְתֵּ֛ר אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַ֖י עַל־בֵּ֥ית הָמָֽן	1	To place someone over something figuratively means to put them in charge of it. Alternate translation: “Esther appointed Mordecai to be in charge of everything that had belonged to Haman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:2	d2tj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֵּ֥ית הָמָֽן	1	See the explanation of this phrase in verse 1. Alternate translation: “everything that Haman had owned” or “the household of Haman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:3	j9d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠תּ֣וֹסֶף אֶסְתֵּ֗ר וַ⁠תְּדַבֵּר֙ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Here the exact meaning of the progression of verbs is uncertain, but this verse probably begins a new event in the story separate from what happened in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “then Esther again spoke in the king’s presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:3	j9d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “while she was in his presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:3	j9d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	Here, **falling** is an idiom referring to the action of bowing down or prostrating oneself, and **face** figuratively represents the front of a person, place, or object. Alternate translation: “and she bowed down” or “and she prostrated herself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:3	acd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	This may actually mean that Esther put her face right on top of the feet of King Ahasuerus. This would have been an act of humility and desperation by which she showed that her need was very great and that she believed the king had great power to help her. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
8:3	acd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	Esther’s action was probably a recognized sign of pleading in this culture. However, it would likely still have been remarkable for a queen to fall at the feet of her husband, the king. you could show this by introducing the information with a phrase like “in fact.” Alternate translation: “in fact, to show how desperately she was pleading, Esther got down and put her face right on top of his feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:3	j1r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	Here, **face** is a metonym meaning the front of a person, place, or object. This phrase means that Esther prostrated herself in front of the feet of King Ahasuerus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:3	jmn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠הַֽעֲבִיר֙ אֶת־רָעַת֙ הָמָ֣ן הָֽ⁠אֲגָגִ֔י	1	Here, **the evil** refers to Haman’s plan. This expression means to prevent a wrong action from happening. Alternate translation: “to stop the evil plan of Haman the Agagite” or “to prevent the evil things from happening that Haman the Agagite had planned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:3	bp22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הָֽ⁠אֲגָגִ֔י	1	This is the name of Haman’s people group. See how you translated this in [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:3	c2hw			מַֽחֲשַׁבְתּ֔⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר חָשַׁ֖ב	1	Alternate translation: “and the plot that he had invented” or “and the plot that Haman invented”
8:4	xh24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יּ֤וֹשֶׁט הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֔ר אֵ֖ת שַׁרְבִ֣ט הַ⁠זָּהָ֑ב	1	As in [5:2](../05/02.md), King Ahasuerus did this to show that Esther had his favor. In that earlier episode, this indicated that he would not enforce the law that said Esther should be executed for coming into the inner court without being summoned. But since Esther was apparently already in the king’s presence on this occasion, it seems that the gesture could also be used generally to show that the king was positively disposed towards a person and would grant the person’s request. Alternate translation: “the king held out his golden scepter to Esther” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
8:4	acd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שַׁרְבִ֣ט הַ⁠זָּהָ֑ב	1	See how you translated this in [4:11](../04/11.md). If it would be helpful, review the explanation of what this object was. Alternate translation: “golden scepter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:4	acd8			וַ⁠תָּ֣קָם אֶסְתֵּ֔ר	1	Alternate translation: “Esther got up off the floor”
8:4	j1r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person, place, or object. This phrase means the Esther now stood facing King Ahasuerus. Alternate translation: “and stood facing the king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:5	w7yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב & וְ⁠כָשֵׁ֤ר הַ⁠דָּבָר֙ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Esther is saying very deferentially that she hopes that the king will think that her suggestion is a good idea and will, therefore, grant her request. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is expressing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “if what I am going to suggest seems like a good idea to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
8:5	r2yy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו & וְ⁠טוֹבָ֥ה אֲנִ֖י בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Esther is saying very deferentially that she hopes that the king is positively disposed towards her, that he thinks well of her, and will, therefore, grant her request. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is expressing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
8:5	acd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	Here Esther addresses the king throughout in the third person as a way of showing respect. You could express the same meaning in the second person, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
8:5	ace0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב	1	This is an idiom that also appears in [1:19](../01/19.md), [3:9](../03/09.md), [5:4](../05/04.md), and [5:8](../05/08.md). A suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But in another place, [7:3](../07/03.md), when Esther was pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people, the suggested alternate translation was, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask” Here, Esther is also pleading, so you could use that phrase here in your translation as well. Alternate translation: “if what I ask for seems right in the king’s evaluation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:5	ftc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן	1	This expression also appears many times in the story. It means to gain the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:5	j1r7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו & לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. These phrases could mean “as I stand here before you.” But “face” could also be referring figuratively to the king himself by naming one part of him. What he thought and felt about Esther’s request would become evident in his face first, so it would be an appropriate part of him to use to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:5	xci7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו	1	Here, **eyes** figuratively represent the action of seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and I please you” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:5	j1r9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִכָּתֵ֞ב לְ⁠הָשִׁ֣יב אֶת־הַ⁠סְּפָרִ֗ים	1	The first letters that told of the plan to destroy the Jews would not be brought back to Susa physically. Rather, **bring back** is an idiom that means “cancel” or “revoke.” Alternate translation: “make a new law to cancel what Haman decreed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:5	nbk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִכָּתֵ֞ב לְ⁠הָשִׁ֣יב אֶת־הַ⁠סְּפָרִ֗ים	1	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “write a new letter” or “make a new law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:6	j2r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֠י	1	Here Esther is giving the reason why she is asking King Ahasuerus to revoke the letters. Alternate translation: “the reason I am asking is that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:6	udt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אֵיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑⁠י וְ⁠אֵֽיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י	1	Esther is actually making a statement, but she expresses herself in question form to show how strongly she feels about what she is saying. She does not actually expect the king to tell her how she could bear seeing her people destroyed. Alternate translation: “I cannot bear to see disaster fall on the Jews” or “I cannot endure watching my relatives be killed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:6	ace1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֵיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑⁠י וְ⁠אֵֽיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י	1	These two sentences mean basically the same thing. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “I could not bear to see my relatives and my whole people destroyed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
8:6	ace2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑⁠י	1	Even though it was morally very wrong for Haman to want to destroy Mordecai’s whole people, here the abstract noun **evil** likely means “harm,” as in [7:7](../07/07.md). It means the same thing as “destruction” in the next sentence. Alternate translation: “my people being destroyed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:6	ace3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִמְצָ֣א	1	As in [1:5](../01/05.md), **find** is an idiom that means something exists in a certain place or time, not that people were looking for it and located it. Esther is speaking of the harm that will exist for the Jews if the effect of Haman’s letters is not undone. Alternate translation: “would be destroyed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:6	ace4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן	1	This abstract noun can be expressed with a verb such as “destroyed.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:6	ace5			מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י	1	Alternate translation: “my relatives”
8:7	j2r7			הִנֵּ֨ה	1	This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”
8:7	ace6			בֵית־הָמָ֜ן נָתַ֣תִּי לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֗ר	1	See the note about this expression in [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “I have given Esther all the property that belonged to Haman” or “I have given Esther the household of Haman”
8:7	h44h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֵית־הָמָ֜ן	1	Here, **house** is a metonym meaning the entire household of Haman. Alternate translation: “the household of Haman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:7	ace7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	וְ⁠אֹת⁠וֹ֙ תָּל֣וּ עַל־הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ	1	You can put this information first because it happened before the king gave Haman’s property to Esther. Alternate translation: “I had my servants impale Haman on a wooden pole” or “I had my servants hang Haman on a gallows” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
8:7	ace8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ	1	See how you translated this in [2:23](../02/23.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Be sure your translation is consistent in the chapters that follow. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:7	j2r9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שָׁלַ֥ח יָד֖⁠וֹ	1	Here the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. Alternate translation: “because he plotted to destroy all the Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:8	acf0			וְ֠⁠אַתֶּם	1	Alternate translation: “so this is what you should do”
8:8	acf1			כִּתְב֨וּ עַל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֜ים כַּ⁠טּ֤וֹב בְּ⁠עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	Alternate translation: “I am giving you permission to write other letters to save your people”
8:8	j3r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּ⁠טּ֤וֹב בְּ⁠עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	Here, **eyes** figuratively represent the action of seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. This phrase means that Esther and Mordecai have permission to write what they think is best. Alternate translation: “as you think is best” or “what you think is best” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:8	j3mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Here, **name** is a metaphor meaning authority. This phrase means Esther and Mordecai have permission to write with the authority of the King Ahasuerus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:8	acf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	King Ahasuerus refers to himself in the third person. You can have him say this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I give you permission to write with my own authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
8:8	j3r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	This is a special ring that could be used to imprint the king’s official seal on a law or decree. Alternate translation: “the ring that has my official seal on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:8	acf3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	King Ahasuerus refers to himself in the third person. You can have him say this in the first person. Alternate translation: “the ring that has my official seal on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
8:8	j3r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי	1	Here, King Ahasuerus is expressing the reason why he cannot simply revoke the first letter and also why Esther and Mordecai can write another letter that people must obey. Alternate translation: “you see” or “people will obey your letter because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:8	acf4			אֵ֥ין לְ⁠הָשִֽׁיב	1	As in verse 5, this expression means “revoke.” Alternate translation: “no one can revoke” or “no one can nullify”
8:8	acf5			כְתָ֞ב & אֵ֥ין לְ⁠הָשִֽׁיב	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this first in the verse because it explains why Ahasuerus answers Esther and Mordecai in the way that he does. See the UST.
8:8	acf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְתָ֞ב אֲשֶׁר־נִכְתָּ֣ב בְּ⁠שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ וְ⁠נַחְתּ֛וֹם בְּ⁠טַבַּ֥עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	The king is describing a general situation, but he has Haman’s letter specifically in mind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Haman wrote his letter with my authority, and he sealed it with the ring that has my official seal on it. No one can revoke a letter like that” (The story explained in [1:19](../01/19.md) that the king’s laws could not be changed once they had been made and proclaimed.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:9	acf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּקָּרְא֣וּ סֹפְרֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ	1	This indicates that what is described in this verse was done because of what the king said in the previous verse.

8:9	acf8			וַ⁠יִּקָּרְא֣וּ סֹפְרֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ	1	If you use an expression such as “called,” make sure your readers will understand that the king likely sent an official to go and bring the scribes back with him. The king did not call out in a loud voice to get them to come.

8:9	acg2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֡ים	1	It appears from verse 11 that the letter would have been addressed specifically to the Jews in the empire, telling them that the king had authorized them to defend themselves. But copies were also sent to all the royal and provincial officials. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the letter addressed the Jews in the empire, but copies were also sent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

These are all people in government positions. The first one is the governor of the province and the other two are rulers under him who govern cities or smaller areas. If your language uses one term for all of these, you could use that with a descriptive phrase such as “to the government leaders of each province and also to the leaders under him.”
8:9	acg4			אֲשֶׁ֣ר ׀ מֵ⁠הֹ֣דּוּ וְ⁠עַד־כּ֗וּשׁ שֶׁ֣בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֤ים וּ⁠מֵאָה֙ מְדִינָ֔ה	1	This is background information explaining how far this new letter had to be sent.

8:9	j5r1			וְ⁠אֶ֨ל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔ים כִּ⁠כְתָבָ֖⁠ם וְ⁠כִ⁠לְשׁוֹנָֽ⁠ם	1	The Jews would have been included among all the people groups in the empire in the phrase “people by people.” So this seems to be saying, “and especially to the Jews.” Verse 11 explains that it was particularly important for the Jews to read the letter because it gave them the right to defend themselves. Alternate translation: “they wrote especially to the Jews in their own script and in their own language”
8:10	acg5			וַ⁠יִּכְתֹּ֗ב & וַ⁠יַּחְתֹּ֖ם	1	**He** refers to Mordecai. If it would be helpful in your language, you can use his name here.

8:10	jf31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּחְתֹּ֖ם בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	This means that Mordecai sealed the letters with this ring.

(1) It could literally mean “hand,” meaning that the runners carried the letters in their hands. (2) It could also be a metaphor for power, control, or authority, meaning that runners were the ones who delivered the letters to all the provinces throughout the empire. Alternate translation: “couriers on horseback delivered the letters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The story says in [9:19](../09/19.md) that not just Jews living in cities but Jews living in rural areas also defended themselves. It is likely that the messengers only published the news in the cities and not the entire countryside, but the news was certainly intended for everyone, not only people living in the cities. Alternate translation: “throughout the empire” or “in each and every city” or “in every single city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:11	e1mj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠הִקָּהֵל֮ וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲמֹ֣ד עַל־נַפְשָׁ⁠ם֒	1	Here, **to stand** is a metaphor meaning to defend oneself and fight back instead of running away from an enemy.

See how you translated this in [3:13](../03/13.md) and [7:4](../07/04.md). Alternate translation: “completely destroy” (A “doublet” can involve the use of more than two words.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

8:11	acg8			טַ֣ף וְ⁠נָשִׁ֑ים	1	Alternate translation: “they could also kill the wives and children of the armed men”
8:11	acg9			וּ⁠שְׁלָלָ֖⁠ם לָ⁠בֽוֹז	1	See how you translated this expression in [3:13](../03/13.md). Alternate translation: “and take everything that belonged to them”

Alternate translation: “they went immediately” or “as quickly as possible” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
8:14	ach8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	הָ⁠רָצִ֞ים רֹכְבֵ֤י הָ⁠רֶ֨כֶשׁ֙ הָֽ⁠אֲחַשְׁתְּרָנִ֔ים	1	To present the events in chronological order, you can put this after the king’s command, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

9:intro	yty1				0	# Esther 9 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Purim\n\nThe events of this chapter were so significant, the Jews celebrated these events every year after this. It is known as “Purim.”\n\n## Important stylistic devices in this chapter\n\n### Ironic Situation\n\nThe day that was supposed to bring great victory to the enemies of the Jews became a day of great victory for the Jews. This is a type of irony.\n\n### Opening Summary\n\nVerse 1 of chapter 9 provides a summary of everything that happens in this chapter. If using an opening summary is not normally used in your language, be sure to mark this as a summary either in the text or in a footnote. An opening summary like this is a characteristic device of Hebrew storytelling. So even though it describes the final outcome, we do not recommend that you move it to the end of the chapter unless it is very confusing to leave it here. To make it clear that verse 1 is only a summary and not the entire story, you could say something like this at the end of the verse: “This is what happened” or “Here are more details about what happened.”

9:27	acq1			כִּ⁠כְתָבָ֖⁠ם	1	Alternate translation: “in the way that Mordecai had told them to do in the letter”
9:27	acq2			וְ⁠כִ⁠זְמַנָּ֑⁠ם	1	This means the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar, as specified in [9:21](../09/21.md). Alternate translation: “on those exact days of the month of Adar”

The repetition is used to emphasize that the Jews have been faithful in doing this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the general meaning by saying something like “So the Jews have celebrated these days.” Alternate translation: “therefore they said that they would remember and celebrate on those two days” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
9:28	hc8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הַ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ֠⁠אֵלֶּה נִזְכָּרִ֨ים וְ⁠נַעֲשִׂ֜ים	1	This expression uses two passive forms, but you could say the same thing using active forms.

Generally speaking, a province would be the largest division of the empire that would identify a person’s location, and a city would be the smallest. Particularly, since the Jews would continue to celebrate Purim after the Persian empire and its provinces no longer exist, you might choose to express the meaning of this figure of speech in a more general way. Alternate translation: “everywhere they have lived” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
9:28	j149		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מְדִינָ֥ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֖ה	1	This expression means “every province.” Alternate translation: “in every single province” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

You can say this positively. Alternate translation: “will always observe the Festival of Purim faithfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

The repetition is used to emphasize that the Jews will definitely not stop celebrating Purim each year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis with a word like “definitely” or “certainly” or “always.” Alternate translation: “the Jews and their descendants will certainly always continue to celebrate this festival of Purim” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

9:29	oc4c			וּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֥י	1	Since the Hebrew verb wrote is feminine singular, it means that the letter was from Esther. The mention of **Mordecai** here probably means that Mordecai helped her to write the letter. Alternate translation: “with Mordecai”

Alternate translation: “an additional letter about Purim with her authority” or (2) the second letter that Mordecai wrote (see verses 20-22), creating the festival of Purim. Alternate translation: “to confirm what Mordecai had written about Purim in his second letter” In either case, this letter from Esther is to add her royal authority to what Mordecai had already written. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
9:30	acr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֨ח סְפָרִ֜ים	1	While this says “**he**,” in context it refers to the letter that Esther wrote with Mordecai’s help. Alternate translation: “they sent copies of this second letter” or “Mordecai ordered messengers to take copies of the letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

The repetition emphasizes that Esther and Mordecai sent this second letter out comprehensively throughout the empire. Alternate translation: “to all the Jews throughout the entire empire of Ahasuerus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
9:30	acr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שֶׁ֨בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֤ים וּ⁠מֵאָה֙ מְדִינָ֔ה	1	The letter was not sent to the provinces as geographical territories, but to the Jews who lived in them.

9:30	iaf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	דִּבְרֵ֥י שָׁל֖וֹם וֶ⁠אֱמֶֽת	1	The abstract nouns **peace** and **truth** can be expressed in other ways. Alternate translation: “encouraging the Jews that they are now safe and can live peacefully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
9:30	mpse			דִּבְרֵ֥י שָׁל֖וֹם וֶ⁠אֱמֶֽת	1	The Hebrew word translated as **truth** here also refers to things that are “sure” or “secure.” When “peace” and “truth” are paired together, they can refer to a peaceful, stable political environment, as in 2 Kings 20:19 and Jeremiah 33:6. Alternate translation: “with a message that assured them of their peaceful and stable situation”

They would have known what the fasting was about. It could be either: (1) fasting as a part of Purim. We know that some Jews fasted on the 13th day of the month of Adar to commemorate the day that Haman intended to destroy them, or (2) other times of fasting. Ever since the destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews had been fasting and mourning in the fifth month of the year to show their sorrow over what had happened. (The story refers to the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in [2:6](../02/06.md).) You could put this information in a footnote if it would help your readers to understand this.
9:31	rl2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַל־זַרְעָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, **seed** is a metaphor meaning the offspring or descendants of the Jews. Alternate translation: “and for their descendants” or “and for their offspring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

10:1	acr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	עַל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ וְ⁠אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	The purpose of this chapter is to describe the greatness of Mordecai. It does that by showing that he was second in command to a very powerful emperor. Referring to both the land and the sea is a way to include everything that lives in a very large area of the earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the general meaning by saying something like “everyone throughout his empire.” Alternate translation: “on all the people in the empire … even the people who lived on the islands in the Mediterranean Sea” or “on everyone throughout the land and even the far-away islands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
10:1	twn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	The phrase **the islands of the sea** likely refers to the fact that the Persian kings had conquered territories reaching all the way to the Mediterranean Sea.

10:1	acr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ וְ⁠אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	These geographic features were not expected to pay the tax.

10:2	acs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֲ⁠לוֹא־הֵ֣ם כְּתוּבִ֗ים	1	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “The king’s scribes made a record … ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

10:3	j161		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠כָל־זַרְעֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **seed** figuratively means “descendants.” Even if you combine the two parallel phrases, you can still convey the idea of “down through the generations” with a word such as “always.” Alternate translation: “and for their descendants” or “and for their offspring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
