front:intro	s7fk				0	# Introduction to 2 Timothy\n\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of 2 Timothy\n\n1. Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1-2:13).\n2. Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14-26).\n3. Paul warns Timothy about future events and instructs him about how to carry out his service to God (3:1-4:8).\n4. Paul makes personal remarks (4:9-22).\n\n### Who wrote the book of 2 Timothy?\n\nPaul wrote 2 Timothy. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nThis book is the second letter Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was his disciple and close friend. Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome. Paul would die soon after writing this letter.\n\n### What is the book of 2 Timothy about?\n\nPaul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed include warnings about false teachers and advice about enduring difficult situations. This letter also shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or “Second Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy” or “The Second Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy?\n\nAs Paul waited in prison, knowing he would die soon, he spoke of being a soldier of Jesus Christ. Soldiers have to obey to their leaders. In the same way, Christians have to obey Jesus. As “soldiers” of Christ, believers are to obey his commands, even if they die as a result.\n\n### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?\n\nGod is the true author of Scripture. He inspired the human authors who wrote the books. That means God in some way caused the people to write what they wrote. This is why the Bible is also referred to as God’s word. This implies several things about it. First, everything that the Bible teaches is free from error and can be trusted. Second, God will always preserve his Scripture for every generation of people. Third, God’s word should be translated into all the world’s languages.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Here the word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 4:22. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### Inclusive and exclusive “we” and “us”\n\nIn this book, “we” and “us” include the writer, Paul, the recipient, Timothy, and all believers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 2 Timothy?\n\nFor the following verses, the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts, and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible already exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text.\n* “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher” (1:11). Some later manuscripts read, “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher to the Gentiles.”\n* “Warn them before God” (2:14). Some later manuscripts read, “Warn them before the Lord.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	p5lf				0	# 2 Timothy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nPaul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Spiritual children\n\nPaul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader. Paul may also have led him to believe in Christ. Therefore, Paul calls Timothy “beloved child.” So even though Paul was not Timothy’s father, Paul speaks of his relationship with Timothy as that of a father and son in a spiritual sense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Persecution\n\nPaul was in prison when he wrote this letter. Paul encourages Timothy to be willing to suffer for the gospel.

1:12	y8l4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ταῦτα πάσχω	1	Paul does not mention the specific **things** that he is **suffering**, but from the context of the letter, the implication is that he is referring to suffering as a prisoner.

The two people involved are Jesus and Paul, but it is not clear which one is holding the **deposit**. This could mean: (1) Paul is trusting Jesus to keep something safe that Paul has entrusted to Jesus. This could be Paul’s own life, or, more specifically, that Paul would remain faithful to Jesus all of his life. Alternate translation: “to keep me faithful to him” (2) Paul is trusting Jesus to preserve the good news that Jesus has deposited with Paul for Paul to preach. Alternate translation: “to help me keep preaching his message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:12	hhu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν παραθήκην μου	1	The term **my** here conveys the idea that this **deposit** is associated with Paul in some way. The particular association depends on what we consider the deposit to be. This could mean: (1) the deposit is associated with Paul because it is Paul’s own life or Paul’s faith in Jesus. Alternate translation: “my faithfulness to him” (2) the deposit is associated with Paul because it is the gospel message that Paul preaches. Alternate translation: “the gospel message that he has entrusted to me to preach” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

1:13	h1qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑγιαινόντων λόγων	1	Paul wants Timothy to teach the things that he taught and thereby to follow his example.

1:13	p016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγων	1	Paul uses the term **words** figuratively to describe the expression in words of what Christians believe. Alternate translation: “of … message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

1:13	b2ld			ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀγάπῃ τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, **love** could refer to: (1) the love that Timothy should show others.

1:13	ix6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul speaks figuratively of **faith and love** as if they were objects inside of **Christ Jesus**. This refers to the faith and love that Jesus enables us to have when we belong to him. See how you translated this phrase in 1:9. Alternate translation: “ours through our relationship to Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:14	i5g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν καλὴν παραθήκην	1	Here, **the good deposit** refers to the gospel message that God has entrusted to Timothy to share with his people.

1:15	p018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1	The word **all** could mean: (1) “many, but not all” in the strict sense, since Timothy and Onesiphorus did not turn away from him. So this would be an example of hyperbole. (2) the men who came to Rome with him from Asia Minor. Alternate translation: “all who came with me from Asia” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:15	p019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀσίᾳ	1	This is the name of a Roman province, Asia Minor, which had its capital at Ephesus, which is where Timothy was living at the time of this letter. It is now a region in modern-day Turkey. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:15	p6f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπεστράφησάν με	1	This is a metaphor that means they left Paul and stopped helping him. Alternate translation: “have deserted me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:15	p020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπεστράφησάν με	1	Paul assumes that Timothy would know that the reason that the believers from Asia had abandoned him was because the authorities had put him in prison. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “have deserted me because I am in prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:15	x6cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Φύγελος	1	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

1:16	e6hl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὀνησιφόρου	1	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:16	izk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	δῴη ἔλεος ὁ Κύριος τῷ Ὀνησιφόρου οἴκῳ	1	Paul is asking God to bless the family of Onesiphorus. You can express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language.

1:16	td1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν ἅλυσίν μου οὐκ ἐπησχύνθη	1	The word **chain** refers to being in prison. Onesiphorus was not ashamed that Paul was in prison but came to visit him frequently. Alternate translation: “was not ashamed of my imprisonment” or “was not ashamed of my being in prison” or “was not ashamed of me, even though I was in prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:17	xfg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, **but** indicates a contrast between the previous verse and this verse. Instead of being ashamed that Paul was in prison, Onesiphorus searched for Paul and found him there. Use whatever form is most natural in your language to show this contrast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1:17	p022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ῥώμῃ	1	This is the name of a city, the capital of the Roman Empire. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:18	p3di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	Paul is again asking for the Lord to **grant mercy** to Onesiphorus. You can express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language. See how you translated this in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “I pray that the Lord will be merciful to Onesiphorus” or “May the Lord have mercy on Onesiphorus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:18	x0eo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	(δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ), καὶ ὅσα ἐν Ἐφέσῳ διηκόνησεν, βέλτιον σὺ γινώσκεις	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these sentences, since the second sentence gives the reason for the action that the first sentence describes. See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:18	r54t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the name “Onesiphorus” instead of the pronoun **him** to make it clear who is receiving mercy. Alternate translation: “May Onesiphorus receive mercy from the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:18	x2dk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	Paul speaks of **mercy** as if it were an object that could be found. Paul is expressing his desire that God show **mercy** to Onesiphorus on the day of judgment. Alternate translation: “to receive mercy from the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:18	f3ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	The expression **that day** refers to the day when God will judge all people; at that time they will receive mercy from the Lord, as Paul mentions, or wrath. Alternate translation: “on the day of judgment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:18	p024		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἐφέσῳ	1	This is the name of a city, the place where Timothy, the recipient of the letter, is located. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:18	p025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅσα ἐν Ἐφέσῳ διηκόνησεν, βέλτιον σὺ γινώσκεις	1	Paul is reminding Timothy that Onesiphorus helped him earlier, in Ephesus. So, Paul is asking the Lord to bless Onesiphorus because he helped Paul several times. Alternate translation: “you know well how much he also helped me earlier when I was in Ephesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:intro	k3zn				0	# 2 Timothy 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn verses 11b-13, Paul may be quoting a poem or hymn. To show the reader that this may be a quotation, in your translation you may choose to set these verses farther to the right than the other verses in the chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### We will reign with him\n\nFaithful Christians will reign with Christ in the future. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Analogies\n\nIn this chapter, Paul makes several analogies to teach about living as a Christian. He uses analogies of soldiers, athletes, and farmers. Later in the chapter, he uses the analogy of different kinds of containers in a house.
2:1	bll5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνον μου	1	Here, **child** is a term of great love and approval. Timothy is not Paul’s biological child. It is also likely that Paul introduced Timothy to Christ, and so this is why Paul considered him like his own child. Alternate translation: “who are like my child” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:1	p026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνδυναμοῦ	1	you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “let God make you strong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:1	e6ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ χάριτι τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul wants Timothy to experience the strength that God provides through his **grace** or kindness. Believers experience God’s grace through knowing Jesus Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **grace** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “as you allow Christ Jesus to kindly empower you through your relationship to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	ig9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ πολλῶν μαρτύρων	1	Paul is referring to teaching in a public setting with others present. The implication is that those others could testify as to what he taught. Alternate translation: “in the presence of people who can testify to what I said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:2	kv1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ταῦτα παράθου πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις	1	Paul speaks of his instructions to Timothy as if they were objects that Timothy could give to other people and trust them to use correctly. Alternate translation: “commit them” or “teach them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:2	p027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις	1	Here the term **men** has a generic sense that may include women. Alternate translation: “to faithful people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:3	yc1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνκακοπάθησον	1	Here, **together** could mean: (1) Timothy should suffer together with Paul. Alternate translation: “Suffer together with me” (2) Timothy should suffer together with all Christians who suffer. Alternate translation: “Suffer together with all believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:3	juu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὡς καλὸς στρατιώτης Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Paul compares suffering for Christ Jesus to the suffering that a good soldier endures. Alternate translation: “as if you were a soldier and Jesus Christ were your commander” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	a4x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a soldier who has to decide between pleasing his leader or pleasing those outside the army. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this. Alternate translation: “Consider that no dedicated soldier allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	p7n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	Paul speaks of being involved in other matters as if they were a net that trapped people and kept them from being able to move freely. Alternate translation: “allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	p028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:4	p029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ βίου	1	By **life**, Paul means, in the context of this metaphor, “civilian life.” The implication is that Timothy and all believers should not allow competing concerns to keep them from serving Christ. Alternate translation: “of everyday life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	d2lg			τῷ στρατολογήσαντι	1	Alternate translation: “his leader” or “the one who commands him”
2:5	d483		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐὰν & ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of an athlete who has to decide between competing lawfully or not lawfully. The athlete will only receive the crown given to the winner if he competes lawfully. By making this comparison with an athlete competing in games, Paul is implicitly telling Timothy that Christ will not reward him unless he serves him **lawfully**, that is, unless he obeys him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “consider that the officials only crown an athlete as the winner if he competes according to the rules” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	p031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐὰν & ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	Paul is also using a hypothetical situation to teach Timothy. Alternate translation: “suppose an athlete did not compete by the rules. Then he would not be crowned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
2:5	p032			ἐὰν & ἀθλῇ τις	1	Here, **competes** refers to competing in an athletic event. Alternate translation: “if an athlete competes in an event”
2:5	xbn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this double negative by translating it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “the officials will only crown him if he competes by the rules” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
2:5	p033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:5	p034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	Paul assumes that Timothy will know that in this culture crowning indicated the winner of a competition. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him as the winner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:5	lea8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	In Paul’s time, when athletes won competitions, they were crowned with wreaths made from the leaves of plants. You can express this idea in your translation by referring to the comparable custom in your own culture, or by using a general expression. Alternate translation: “the officials will not give him an award” or “the officials will not declare him to be the winner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:5	reg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	Paul is referring to the rules that governed a competition. The athletes had to obey the rules or they would be removed from the competition and not have an opportunity to win. If it would be helpful in your language, you could mention these rules. Alternate translation: “he does not compete according to the rules” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:6	wz35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν κοπιῶντα γεωργὸν δεῖ πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν	1	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a farmer who has to decide between working hard or not working hard. The farmer will receive a share of the harvest if he is working hard. By making this comparison, Paul is encouraging Timothy to work hard in his service to Christ so that God will reward him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “Consider that a farmer who works hard should receive a share of the crops before anyone else” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:6	p035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν	1	In this illustration, it seems that the hardworking farmer is working with other farmers who will all receive a part of the crop after the harvest. But since this farmer works harder than the others, he should receive before the others. It is implied that receiving first is best, possibly because the quality of the crop is better. Alternate translation: “receive the best share of the crops” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:7	bdk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νόει ὃ λέγω, δώσει γάρ σοι ὁ Κύριος σύνεσιν	1	Paul gave Timothy three metaphors in verses 3-6, but he did not completely explain their implications. He expected Timothy to figure out, with God’s help, the lesson of these metaphors for Christ’s servants. For that reason, if you want to include an explanation of the meaning of the metaphors, we recommend that you state the meaning in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. Alternate translation: “you will have to think carefully about what I have just told you to understand it completely, but you can depend on God to help you to do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:7	p036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὃ λέγω	1	Paul refers to what he has just written in his letter with the verb **saying** to express the idea of communicating. Alternate translation: “what I have just told you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:7	a22q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν πᾶσιν	1	Here, **in everything** refers to everything related to the three metaphors that Paul has written just before this. Alternate translation: “about everything that I have just said” or “about all that I said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:8	mh1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυείδ	1	The phrase **from the seed of** refers figuratively to Jesus being descended from King David. Alternate translation: “who is a descendant of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:8	p037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Δαυείδ	1	This is the name of a man, a great king of Israel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:8	wt31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	The expression **raised from the dead** is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. Alternate translation: “whom God caused to live again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:8	p038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “whom God raised from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:8	s4vh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου	1	The term **my** conveys the idea that it is the gospel associated with Paul because he preaches it. Alternate translation: “according to the gospel message that I preach” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:9	t2ax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	μέχρι δεσμῶν	1	Paul uses the expression **unto chains** figuratively to express how far his suffering has gone: from being beaten, to being arrested, to being in chains in prison. Alternate translation: “to the point of being imprisoned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:9	p039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς κακοῦργος	1	Paul compares his situation to the shameful one that a person would be in who had actually committed a crime. Alternate translation: “as if I were a criminal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:9	pc6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται	1	Here, **bound** means being held in chains as a prisoner, referring to Paul’s condition. Paul contrasts himself, an actual prisoner, with God’s message, which can never be held prisoner. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:9	p040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this idea. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:9	p041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to describe the message from God that he and others are communicating with words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:10	p042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντα ὑπομένω	1	Here the term **all** is a generalization that likely refers to the sufferings that Paul describes in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “I endure all of these sufferings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:10	aa1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς	1	The term **chosen** is an adjective that functions as a noun here and refers to a group of people. If your language would not use an adjective in that way, you could translate this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “for the people whom God has chosen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:10	j2bk			καὶ αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	The phrase **obtain the salvation** could also be expressed with Christ Jesus, who grants salvation, as the subject. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may grant them salvation”
2:10	p043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **salvation** with a verb. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may save them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:10	el68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ δόξης αἰωνίου	1	The abstract noun **glory** refers to the wonderful condition that people will experience when they are in the presence of God. It comes from God himself and he shares it with those who are saved by Jesus Christ, and this condition is **eternal**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “and know how glorious it is to be with God forever” or “and experience God’s wonderful presence forever” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:11	nr7u			πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	In this context, the term **word** refers to the statement of doctrine that follows. See how you translated this phrase in [1 Timothy 1:15](../1ti/01/15.md) Alternate translation: “This statement is dependable”
2:11	p044			πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	You could represent the meaning of the adjective **trustworthy** with an active verb, if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you could trust this statement”
2:11	p045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation. The words that follow in the rest of this verse and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md) are a poem or hymn that expresses the message that Paul says is trustworthy. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by marking these words as a direct quotation or by setting them farther to the right, as the General Notes at the beginning of this chapter suggest. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:11	g6e4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν, καὶ συνζήσομεν	1	This is the beginning of a poem or hymn that Paul is probably quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, such as by setting individual phrases on separate lines, you could use it here and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md). If not, you could translate this material as regular prose rather than as poetry. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
2:11	in38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰ & συναπεθάνομεν	1	Paul is speaking figuratively since he and Timothy and other believers who should trust this statement have not actually died. This could refer to: (1) the way that believers accept Jesus’ death for their sins when they trust him for salvation. This means that they have figuratively “died” to their old life of sin. Alternate translation: “if we have ended our old way of life by accepting Jesus’ death for us” (2) the way that people who believe in Jesus may suffer for him, possibly to the point of dying for him. Alternate translation: “if we are prepared to die for Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:11	p046			καὶ συνζήσομεν	1	Although Paul is referring to dying with Christ in a figurative sense, **live** is probably not figurative, but could refer to: (1) life after physical death. This seems most likely given Paul’s mention of “eternal glory” in the previous verse and “we will reign with him” in the next. Alternate translation: “then God will raise us from the dead to live with Jesus” (2) how believers will act in this life before physical death. Alternate translation: “we will not pursue our own desires, instead we will do what Jesus wants us to do”
2:12	p048			εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα	1	Paul uses the term **deny** to refer to the action of believers saying that they do not know Jesus Christ during this present life. It is presented as the opposite of **endure**, so it refers to someone who gives in to persecution and denies being a follower of Jesus. Alternate translation: “if we say now that we do not know him”
2:12	p049			κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς	1	In this second usage of the word **deny**, Paul is referring to the action of Jesus Christ on the day of final judgment. On that day, Jesus will either receive a faithful believer or reject those who are not true followers. Those who deny that they are followers of Jesus while on earth are not true followers. Alternate translation: “he will reject us on the day of judgment”
2:13	ke4w			εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν	1	Paul uses the word **unfaithful** to express the condition of believers who do not continue to obey Jesus, but rather disobey him. Alternate translation: “if we disobey Jesus” or “if we do not do what Jesus wants us to do”
2:13	p050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκεῖνος πιστὸς μένει	1	This could mean : (1) he remains faithful to them. (2) he remains true to himself. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	ihd4			ἀρνήσασθαι & ἑαυτὸν οὐ δύναται	1	Paul states that Jesus is not able to **deny himself**, meaning that Jesus is not able to go against his character and will remain true to what he said he would do. Paul may have one or both of the following ideas in mind. (1) Jesus’ character includes being the Savior who can forgive our unfaithfulness when we repent of it, as Peter experienced (John 21:15-19). This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains faithful to us.” (2) Jesus’ character also includes being the holy God who judges people for their sin when they do not repent. This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains true to himself.” Alternate translation: “he must always act according to his character”
2:14	u661			ὑπομίμνῃσκε	1	The word **them**, which is implicit in the Greek verb, probably refers to the people that Timothy has responsibility over. Alternate translation: “Remind the people there”
2:14	p051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “as God is watching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	r5lq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The implication is that Paul is telling Timothy to tell the believers, when he gives them this command, that God will be watching what they do. Alternate translation: “with God as their witness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:14	g6p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ λογομαχεῖν	1	Paul uses the term **battle** figuratively to describe arguments. This could mean: (1) the believers are not to argue about unimportant things such as the words that someone uses to present the gospel message. That only distracts people from talking about important things, such as the gospel message itself. Alternate translation: “not to fight about small things like words” (2) the believers are not to argue about what words mean. Again, this causes disunity among the believers for no good reason. Alternate translation: “not to fight about the meanings of words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	rke6			ἐπ’ οὐδὲν χρήσιμον	1	Paul adds that battling about words has no benefit for those involved. Alternate translation: “it does not benefit anyone”
2:14	ywty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **destruction** with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “it destroys those who hear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:14	x7gx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων	1	Here, **destruction** refers not to physical harm, but to the spiritual harm that is done to believers who hear their teachers foolishly arguing about unimportant things. This teaches the believers that being seen as right about small things is more important than love and unity, and can cause them to have wrong ideas about the faith or to stop following Jesus altogether. Alternate translation: “and can make those who hear it want to stop following Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:15	m3vy			σπούδασον σεαυτὸν, δόκιμον παραστῆσαι τῷ Θεῷ	1	Alternate translation: “Do your best to please God”
2:15	rj6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐργάτην	1	Paul says figuratively that Timothy will be a skilled workman if he correctly teaches God’s word. Alternate translation: “like a craftsman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:15	xgz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὀρθοτομοῦντα τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Paul refers figuratively to **the word of truth** as if it were a path that someone was cutting through difficult terrain. When such a path is **straight**, travelers can follow it directly to their destination. By contrast, the useless discussions that Paul describes in [2:14](../02/14.md) and [2:16](../02/16.md) would be needless detours in terms of this same metaphor. Alternate translation: “show people how to follow the Scriptures directly” or “teach the Scriptures correctly so that people can follow them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:15	p052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to something that is expressed in words. This could refer to: (1) the message that Timothy is to teach. Alternate translation: “the true message” (2) the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:15	p053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “the true message” or “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:16	e27q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ πλεῖον & προκόψουσιν ἀσεβείας	1	Paul speaks of these discussions figuratively as if they could physically progress in a certain direction, and he speaks of godlessness as that direction. Paul is figuratively describing the effect that these discussions have on people. Alternate translation: “they cause people to become more and more ungodly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:17	i73t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὁ λόγος αὐτῶν ὡς γάγγραινα νομὴν ἕξει	1	This is a simile. It means that something will spread from person to person and harm the faith of all those who hear it. The thing that will spread could refer to: (1) the habit of having useless and godless discussions. (2) the things that the people were saying in these empty discussions, or both. Alternate translation: “these empty discussions will spread quickly and cause destruction like an infectious disease” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:17	p054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος αὐτῶν	1	Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to something that is expressed in words. Alternate translation: “these discussions” or “what people who take part in these discussions say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:17	p055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὡς γάγγραινα	1	**Gangrene** is type of tissue death caused by infection or lack of blood circulation. It quickly spreads in a person’s body and can lead to death. If your readers would not know what **gangrene** is, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “like an infectious disease” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:17	p056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὧν ἐστιν Ὑμέναιος, καὶ Φίλητος	1	Paul gives Timothy the names of two men who are examples of ungodliness and foolish talk. To make the relationship between these names and the preceding **their word** clear in your language, you may have to make this explicit. Alternate translation: “Hymeneus and Philetus are such people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:17	x2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὑμέναιος, καὶ Φίλητος	1	These are names of men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:18	fi9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἵτινες περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἠστόχησαν	1	Paul uses this expression to speak figuratively of faith in Christ as if it were a target at which people should aim. Those who have **missed the mark** do not believe or teach what is true. Alternate translation: “who are teaching things that are not true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:18	p057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἵτινες περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἠστόχησαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “who teach things that are not true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:18	pu22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάστασιν ἤδη γεγονέναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **resurrection** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “God has already raised the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:18	ura5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνατρέπουσιν τήν τινων πίστιν	1	Paul refers to **faith** as though it were an object that could be destroyed. Alternate translation: “they are causing some people to stop believing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:19	ir1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ & στερεὸς θεμέλιος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἕστηκεν	1	Paul uses the image of the foundation of a building to explain that even though a false and destructive message has been destroying the faith of some people, God has nevertheless given people who want to continue to follow him a true message, which figuratively provides for them a safe and secure “place to stand.” Alternate translation: “God has provided a secure basis for people to continue to believe in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:19	p058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔχων τὴν σφραγῖδα ταύτην	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the inscription on this foundation as if it were a **seal**, since seals on the outside of documents often bore inscriptions describing their contents. Alternate translation: “having this inscription” or “which can be described in this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:19	p059		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ἔχων τὴν σφραγῖδα ταύτην	1	Paul uses this phrase to introduce two direct quotations. The statements that follow in the rest of this verse describe two aspects of the basis that God has provided for people to continue to believe in him. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by marking these statements as quotations. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:19	nd7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ ὀνομάζων τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου	1	The expression **names the name of the Lord** is an idiom that refers to saying the name of the Lord in order to declare that one belongs to him. Alternate translation: “who says he believes in the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:19	y3bc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀποστήτω ἀπὸ ἀδικίας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **unrighteousness** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “must stop doing evil things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:20	p060		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν μεγάλῃ δὲ οἰκίᾳ, οὐκ ἔστιν μόνον σκεύη χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀργυρᾶ, ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύλινα καὶ ὀστράκινα	1	To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor that compares the containers that are in the home of a wealthy person with people in the church. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this is a metaphor or illustration. Alternate translation: “Consider this illustration: in the home of a wealthy person, there are containers made of gold and silver, and there are also containers made of wood and clay” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	p061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύλινα καὶ ὀστράκινα	1	Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and there are also containers made of wood and clay” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:20	j75l			σκεύη	1	The word **container** is a general term for items used to hold other things, such as grain, food, drink, or refuse. If your language does not have a general word, you can use a specific word such as “bowl” or “pot.”
2:20	mt5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἃ μὲν εἰς τιμὴν, ἃ δὲ εἰς ἀτιμίαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **honor** and **dishonor** by stating the ideas behind them with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “he uses the former at events to honor people and he uses the latter to do things that no one wants to see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:21	jm3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκκαθάρῃ ἑαυτὸν ἀπὸ τούτων	1	Here Paul continues the metaphor that compares people in the church to containers in a great house that have different uses. Paul speaks figuratively of a person washing himself clean as though he had been a pot full of something bad. By this he means that the person has given up certain associations or activities. Here, **these** could refer to: (1) the false teachers who are destroying the faith of some people. Alternate translation: “has disassociated himself from these false teachers” (2) the activities of quarreling and false teaching that Paul has warned Timothy about. Alternate translation: “has stopped doing these ungodly actions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:21	g79f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν	1	Paul speaks figuratively of a person who has given up these associations or activities as if he were a particular kind of container. Alternate translation: “he will be like a dish for special occasions” or “he will be like a dish that is used to honor people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:21	p062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν	1	The implication is that God will be able to give important assignments to a person who is free from wrong associations or activities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he will be someone to whom God can give important assignments” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:21	mh63			ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν, ἡγιασμένον εὔχρηστον τῷ Δεσπότῃ, εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἡτοιμασμένον	1	These four phrases could mean: (1) the ones beginning with **having been** give the reason for the phrase before them. Alternate translation: “he will be a container for honor because he has been sanctified, and he will be useful to the Master because he has been prepared for every good work” (2) all four phrases could simply be describing the person. Alternate translation: “he will be a container for honor, someone who is sanctified, useful to the Master, and ready for every good work”
2:21	p063		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡγιασμένον	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea, and you can state who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom God has set apart for himself” or “whom God has set apart for a special purpose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:21	nl5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡγιασμένον	1	If this phrase is continuing the metaphor of objects in a house, then Paul is referring to a person who is free from wrong associations or activities as if he were a precious object whose owner keeps it in a special place. Whether this phrase is continuing the metaphor or not, it still expresses the idea of being “dedicated” for a special purpose. Alternate translation: “whom God has set apart for a special purpose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:21	p064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εὔχρηστον τῷ Δεσπότῃ	1	In the context of the metaphor of the house, Paul speaks of God figuratively as the head of the household. Alternate translation: “useful to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:21	p065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἡτοιμασμένον	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea.

He speaks of these positive things as if Timothy should run towards them because they will do him good. Alternate translation: “be eager to do what is right, to believe in God, to love God and others, and to live in peace with people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:22	p067		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνην, πίστιν, ἀγάπην, εἰρήνην	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **righteousness**, **faith**, **love**, and **peace** by stating the ideas behind them with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “do what is right, believe in God, love other people, and live peacefully with other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:22	hg99			μετὰ τῶν ἐπικαλουμένων τὸν Κύριον ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	This likely means that Paul wants Timothy to pursue these positive things together with others who are sincere in their faith. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could put this phrase at the beginning of Paul’s command to Timothy, as in the UST, before **pursue**. Alternate translation: “together with those who worship the Lord with sincere intentions”
2:22	gl3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν ἐπικαλουμένων τὸν Κύριον	1	The expression **call on the Lord** is an idiom that means to trust and worship the Lord. Alternate translation: “those who worship the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:22	p068		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	Paul uses a physical part of the body, the **heart**, figuratively to represent the intentions and desires of a person. Alternate translation: “with sincere intentions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “do not become involved in foolish and ignorant discussions” or “do not allow people to involve you in discussions that they start because they are foolish and ignorant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:23	p069		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	μωρὰς καὶ ἀπαιδεύτους ζητήσεις	1	Paul may be using the words **foolish** and **ignorant** together to emphasize a single idea. Alternate translation: “very stupid questions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

Alternate translation: “meekly” or “gently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:25	u6rp			παιδεύοντα	1	Paul presents this as the godly response to quarrels. This term can mean “teach” or “correct.” Alternate translation: “teaching” or “correcting”

3:intro	k2cr				0	# 2 Timothy 3 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\nMany scholars understand the **last days** to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return, which includes Paul’s time. If so, then what Paul teaches in this chapter about being persecuted applies to all believers. But some scholars understand the **last days** to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. If that is the meaning, then Paul is prophesying in verses 1-9 and 13 about those days. If possible, translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate these verses. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])
3:1	g65r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις	1	Paul is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “during the period of time before the end” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

3:2	p075		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ ἄνθρωποι	1	Here Paul is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:2	jb27			φίλαυτοι	1	Here, **self-loving** refers to loving oneself more than loving family or friends with a natural human love. This is not the kind of love that comes from God. Alternate translation: “self-centered”
3:3	u3n7			ἄστοργοι	1	The term **unloving** means that they will not love other people whom they should love. Alternate translation: “they will not love their own families”
3:3	r2uv			ἄσπονδοι	1	The term **irreconcilable** means they will not agree to make peace with others and will insist on living in a state of conflict in order to have their own way. Alternate translation: “they will not agree with anyone” or “they will not live in peace with anyone”
3:3	ks9y			ἀφιλάγαθοι	1	The phrase **not good-loving** could be translated by removing the negative **not** and replacing **loving** with the opposite term “hating.” Alternate translation: “They will hate what is good”

3:5	k5dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἔχοντες μόρφωσιν εὐσεβείας	1	The expression **a form of** indicates that their **godliness** is not genuine or true. Alternate translation: “appearing to have godliness” or “appearing to honor God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

4:intro	k2xa				0	# 2 Timothy 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Paul gives a solemn charge to Timothy (4:1-8)\n2. Paul tells Timothy how he is doing (4:9-18)\n3. Paul sends personal greetings (4:19-22)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “I adjure you”\n\nWith these words Paul challenges Timothy in the most serious way possible to do what he is telling him to do. It is a way of commanding Timothy, not by Paul’s own authority, but by the authority that he then refers to, that of God and Jesus Christ. In other words, Paul is saying that God and Jesus Christ are commanding Timothy through Paul.\n\n### Crown\n\nScripture uses the image of a crown to represent different things. In this chapter, Paul describes Christ as awarding a crown to believers as a metaphor for the reward that Christ will give them for having lived rightly on this earth.

4:6	sh23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγὼ & ἤδη σπένδομαι	1	Paul speaks of himself as if he were wine in a cup that was being poured out as a sacrifice to God. Alternate translation: “the sacrifice of my life to God will soon be complete” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:6	p108		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγὼ & ἤδη σπένδομαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “My life will soon end as a sacrifice to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:6	fb7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ὁ καιρὸς τῆς ἀναλύσεώς μου ἐφέστηκεν	1	Paul refers to his death as a **departure**. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant.

4:7	vk2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν πίστιν τετήρηκα	1	Paul speaks of **the faith**, by which he means his trust in Christ and his obedience to God, as if they were valuable objects that he has kept safe in his possession. This could mean: (1) Paul was faithful to do what God told him to do. Alternate translation: “I have remained faithful in doing my ministry” (2) Paul was faithful to teach the truth. Alternate translation: “I have preserved the teachings from any error” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:8	ujg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπόκειταί μοι ὁ τῆς δικαιοσύνης στέφανος	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea.

4:8	dwn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	στέφανος	1	See how you translated **crown** in [2:5](../02/05.md). The **crown** that Paul is using as an illustration of the future award from God was a wreath made of laurel tree leaves that was given to winners of athletic contests.

4:10	ji2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν νῦν αἰῶνα	1	The expression **the present age** refers to worldly things as opposed to the things of God.

4:10	u2qb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Κρήσκης εἰς Γαλατίαν, Τίτος εἰς Δαλματίαν	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. He means that like Demas, Crescens and Titus have left him. However, he is probably not saying that they did this because they also “loved this present age” like Demas. It is more likely that they are traveling to help the churches. Alternate translation: “Crescens has left me and gone to Galatia, and Titus has left me and gone to Dalmatia” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:10	gs61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Γαλατίαν & Δαλματίαν	1	This are the names of parts of the Roman empire. **Galatia** is an official Roman province and **Dalmatia** is an area in the southern part of the province of Illyricum. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

4:12	y60r			ἀπέστειλα	1	Timothy is at Ephesus when he receives this letter. It may be that Tychicus is the one who carried this letter to Timothy at Ephesus. If so, then Paul is writing from Timothy’s perspective, who would view Paul’s sending of Tychicus as a past event. If this is confusing in your language and you want to include this possibility, you may need to change the tense of the verb to future. Alternate translation: “soon I will be sending”
4:12	p112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἔφεσον	1	This is the name of a city. This is the city where Timothy is as he receives this letter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

4:16	v847			ἐν τῇ πρώτῃ μου ἀπολογίᾳ	1	Paul is referring to the opening session of his trial. By writing **first**, he is likely indicating that he will have to appear in court again. Alternate translation: “At the opening session of my trial” or “When I first appeared in court and explained my actions”
4:16	f2c3			οὐδείς μοι παρεγένετο	1	Paul explains to Timothy that he had to go to court alone, without any supporters. Alternate translation: “no one testified on my behalf”
4:16	rm2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ αὐτοῖς λογισθείη	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea.

4:17	p113		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	καὶ ἀκούσωσιν πάντα τὰ ἔθνη	1	Here, **all** could be: (1) a figurative generalization.

Alternate translation: “so that all the Gentiles who were there might hear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
4:17	gsr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐρύσθην ἐκ στόματος λέοντος	1	Paul speaks figuratively as if he had been in danger of being killed by a lion at his court appearance. He could mean the physical danger of being sentenced to execution, or the spiritual danger of being tempted not to speak boldly for Jesus, or both. It would probably be best to leave both possibilities open in your translation. Alternate translation: “I was rescued from great danger” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “Onesiphorus and everyone who lives with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:19	mef8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὀνησιφόρου	1	**Onesiphorus** is the name of a man. See how you translated this name in [1:16](../01/16.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

If winter is the warm season in your area and summer is the cold season, or if your area does not have a cold season but a rainy season, you could use a more general expression. Alternate translation: “before the cold weather makes travel difficult” or “before the weather changes and makes travel difficult” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:21	z1j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀσπάζεταί σε Εὔβουλος, καὶ Πούδης, καὶ Λίνος, καὶ Κλαυδία, καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete.

4:22	p119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὁ Κύριος μετὰ τοῦ πνεύματός σου	1	Paul figuratively describes Timothy as a whole person by reference to his **spirit**, perhaps because he is wishing particularly for Timothy to receive spiritual strengthening.
