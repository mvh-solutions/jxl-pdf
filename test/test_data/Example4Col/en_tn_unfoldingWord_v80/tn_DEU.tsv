front:intro	rm3n				0	# Introduction to Deuteronomy\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Deuteronomy\n\n1. Moses reminds Israel of how Yahweh guided them through the wilderness (1:1–3:29)\n1. Moses appeals for Israel to obey the law of Yahweh (4:1–43)\n1. The Ten Commandments (5:1–10:22)\n1. Rules and warnings from the Law (11:1–26:19)\n1. Instructions for entering Canaan (27:1–26)\n1. Blessings for obeying and curses for disobeying (28:1-68)\n1. The covenant renewed (29:1-30:20)\n1. Last words of Moses, the Song of Moses, and his death (31:1–34:12)\n\n\n### What is the Book of Deuteronomy about?\n\nIn the book of Deuteronomy, Moses repeats the laws of the covenant that God made with the people of Israel. The people of Israel were about to go into the Promised Land. Before they entered the land, Moses reminded them of what Yahweh did for them and what he expected from them. Moses warned the people about worshipping idols and no longer trusting Yahweh once they settled in the Promised Land. Yahweh promised to judge those who disobey him and to bless those who obey his Law. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe name “Deuteronomy” means “Second Law” or “the retelling of the Law.” Translators may decide on a title such as, “A Repeat of the Law” or “Moses Explains the Law Again.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Deuteronomy?\n\nThe writers of both the Old and New Testament present Moses as being very involved with writing the Book of Deuteronomy. However, many scholars think that Joshua wrote chapter 34. This chapter tells how Moses died.\n\n### What are the important features of the Book of Deuteronomy?\n\nThe book contains a series of speeches that Moses gave to Israel before he died. He spoke these things just before the people entered the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why did Yahweh command the Israelites to completely destroy the people who lived in the Promised Land?\n\nAs God prepared the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he commanded them to completely destroy the Canaanite people who lived there. The Israelites would then not be tempted to join them and worship their false gods.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What is the role of God’s name in Deuteronomy?\n\nGod’s name is mentioned over thirty times in the book of Deuteronomy. The use of God’s name in this book usually represents God’s honor or fame. At other times in Deuteronomy, God’s name represents his presence. God said he would choose a place and make his name dwell there. This means God’s presence would be there. The people were to go to that place to worship him.\n\n### Can this book be translated before the rest of the Pentateuch?\n\nThe Books of Genesis and Exodus help to explain what happens in Deuteronomy. For this reason, those books should be translated before the Book of Deuteronomy.
1:intro	ggp9				0	# Deuteronomy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter forms a continuation with the last chapter of the book of Numbers.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s victory\nThe chapter explains that Israel’s conquering of the Promised Land will be done by Yahweh. They are not to fear the people of Canaan but be obedient to Yahweh. Yahweh is bringing about his judgement upon the people of Canaan. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])\n\n### Possessing the land\nWhile the Promised Land belongs to Israel, they do not possess the land. Possessing the land is an important theme. Posessing the land depended on Israel’s faithfulness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])

19:intro	r53s				0	# Deuteronomy 19 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Justice\nAnother way justice would be maintained in Israel was by avoiding revenge killings. This chapter describes the establishment of special cities to protect those fleeing from revenge killings. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])\n\n### Witnesses\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common for a person to be punished by the testimony of a single person, especially if this was an important person. The rules in this chapter give protection to people, especially the poor by requiring multiple witnesses. This allowed justice to be done. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Law of retaliation\nThe chapter describes a famous law, often called the “law of retaliation.” It is said, an “eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.” This does not mean a person who causes another person to lose their eye must have their own eye removed as punishment. This law is not about making all things equal. Instead, it is about limiting the punishment or the ability of a person to retaliate. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

20:intro	qq8m				0	# Deuteronomy 20 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s protection\nIsrael was not to worry about the power and strength of other nations. Instead, they were to trust in the power of Yahweh. He is the source of their military strength and protection. This is why a priest leads them into battle, rather than a military commander. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n\n### Holy war\nIsrael’s conquering of the Promised Land was unique in history. It was a type of holy war and had special rules. This war was really Yahweh’s punishment against the sin of the Canaanite people. If the people were not completely destroyed, they would cause Israel to sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### “What man is there”\nThis phrase is used several times to introduce a rhetorical question. The questions are intended to tell the readers that Yahweh only wants soldiers who are completely dedicated to fighting for him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Excused from fighting\nIn ancient Israel, men were excused from fighting in battle for several different reasons. Some of these reasons are mentioned in this chapter. Apparently, needing to establish a new house, the need to harvest a field and cowardice were possible excuses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
