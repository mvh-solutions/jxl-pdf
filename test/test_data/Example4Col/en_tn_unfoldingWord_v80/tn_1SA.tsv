Samuel as judge over Israel (1:1–7:17)\n    * Samuel as a child (1:1–3:21)\n    * Shiloh priesthood; the fall and death of Eli the priest (4:1–22)\n    * The ark of God and the war with the Philistines (5:1–6:21)\n    * Mizpah; Samuel’s rule over Israel (7:1–17)\n1.

David and his conflicts with Saul (16:1–31:13)\n    * God’s choice of David to be king (16:1–23)\n    * David fights Goliath (17:1–58)\n    * Saul’s jealousy of David; David and Jonathan (18:1–20:42)\n    * David in the wilderness; David in Philistia (21:1–30:31)\n    * Death of Saul (31:1–13)\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Samuel about?\n\nThe Book of 1 Samuel is about Samuel, Saul, and David. Samuel was the last of the judges over Israel. Saul was the first king of Israel. Much of the book is about how Saul became king, then how he later sinned against God and died. God chose David to be king after Saul. This book shows how God protected David when Saul tried to kill him.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators can use the traditional title “1 Samuel” or “First Samuel.” Or, translators may consider a clearer title such as “The First Book About Samuel, Saul, and David.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### What is the purpose of the Book of 1 Samuel?\n\nThe purpose of 1 Samuel is to give an account of the events leading up to David becoming king of Israel. In 1 Samuel, the twelve tribes of Israel unite under the first king of Israel, Saul. But Saul does not obey Yahweh’s commands. So God uses Samuel to choose David as a king who will trust and obey Yahweh.\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Samuel?\n\nIt is uncertain who wrote 1 Samuel. It may have been someone alive soon after King Solomon died. When Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The author probably lived in the southern kingdom of Judah. A descendant of David continued to rule over the southern kingdom. The author may have written 1 Samuel to defend David’s right to be king. This would prove that David’s descendant was the rightful king of God’s people.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Who is “Yahweh’s anointed”?\n\nThe writer of 1 Samuel often speaks of “Yahweh’s anointed.” This refers to the one whom Yahweh chose to be the king of his people. Also, the phrase “Yahweh’s anointed” would make later readers think about the future descendant of David who would become king of God’s people. This person who Yahweh chose would be known as the Messiah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are curses, as found in 1 Samuel and elsewhere?\n\nA curse is a strong statement a person makes to cause bad things to happen to the person or thing being cursed. A curse usually has this pattern: “May God do so to you, and even more, if you hide anything from me of all the words that he spoke to you” (1 Sam. 3:17). Other instances of curses in 1 and 2 Samuel are found in 1 Sam 14:44; 20:13; 25:22; 2 Sam 3:9, 35; and 19:13. The translator should represent a curse in the project language in as strong a way as possible.\n\n### How is the name “Israel” used in the Bible?\n\nThe name “Israel” is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was the son of Isaac. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])\n\nThe Book of 1 Samuel has two references to Israel and Judah ([1 Samuel 17:52](../17/52.md), [1 Samuel 18:16](../18/16.md)). However, these references appear in the text long before the two kingdoms split apart. It seems clear that the references to Israel and Judah are in the text because the author wrote at a time after the kingdoms split. He wanted the readers to understand that all the twelve tribes had supported David.\n\n### What is the meaning of the phrase “to this day”?\n\nThis phrase was used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time already passed. He must avoid giving the impression that the present day of the translation’s readers is meant. The translator might decide to say, “to this day, at the time when this is being written” or “to this day, at the time of writing.” This phrase occurs in 1 Samuel 5:5; 6:18: 27:6; 30:25.
1:intro	cj3l				0	# 1 Samuel 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces Samuel. It is the beginning of the section 1, Samuel chapters 1-7, which tell about Samuel, the religious leader of Israel.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Two wives\nThis was a common practice in the ancient Near East. It was against the law of Moses. The men of Israel would have sinned if they married more than one woman. This type of marriage always creates problems because of jealousy. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]])\n\n### “Pay his vow”\nIt was customary for Israelites to promise God to make a sacrifice to him if God answered special prayers. Making such a sacrifice was called paying one’s vow. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/vow]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Idioms\n\nWhen Hannah wanted to assure Eli she was telling the truth, she used the idiom “as you live.” This is a type of oath formula meaning “I promise you I am telling the truth.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\nThe author also uses the phrase “call to mind.” This is a common idiom meaning “remember.”

2:intro	fe7v				0	# 1 Samuel 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with Hannah’s poetic prayer in 2:1-10 .\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Hannah’s song of praise to God\n\nThis song is about how God protects the weak and strengthens them. He humbles the rich, provides for the poor, and defeats his enemies.\n\n### Eli’s Sons\n\nEli, the chief priest, had two sons. They were ungodly priests who continually sinned and did not honor God. Eli corrected them but they did not listen. A prophet warned Eli that God would stop his family from being priests and his sons would both die on the same day. At the same time, Samuel was growing up and serving God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\nThis chapter has many figures of speech because the first part of the chapter is a song and the last part of the chapter is a prophecy. Songs and prophecy tend to have many figures of speech.\n\n### Synecdoches\n\n“My heart” and “my mouth” are synecdoches referencing the speaker. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### Metonymies\n\nBody parts are often used to stand for activities involving that part of the body. “The feet of his faithful people” is a metonym meaning what they are doing or where they are going. Place names are often used for people in that place such as “the ends of the earth” meaning the people living in the ends of the earth. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### Metaphors\n\nHannah used many military metaphors: “rock,” representing protection; “the bows of the mighty men are broken,” representing military defeat; “the horn of his anointed,” representing the power of the one that God has chosen to be king. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nGod used three rhetorical questions to correct and condemn Eli. “Did I not reveal myself to the house of your ancestor, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?” “Why then do you scorn my offerings that I required in the place where I live?” “Why do you honor your sons above me by making yourselves fat with the best of every offering of my people Israel?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

4:intro	a7dh				0	# 1 Samuel 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### The Ark of the Covenant in Philistine country\n\nThis chapter begins a new section on the Ark and the Philistines. It recounts two battles between Israel and the Philistines. In both battles, Israel was badly defeated and, in the second, the Ark was captured.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The Ark is captured\n\nThe Philistine army invaded Israel, and Israel’s army went to fight them but was defeated. Israel decided that if they took the Ark into the next battle, God would cause them to win. When Eli’s sons took the Ark into the next battle and the Philistines won the battle, they killed Eli’s two sons and captured the Ark. When Eli heard the Ark was captured, he fell over, broke his neck, and died. Hearing this news, his daughter-in-law named her baby “the glory has departed.”\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Question\n\nThe Philistines expressed their fear using a rhetorical question: “Who will protect us from the strength of this mighty God?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:1	ahq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ebenezer & Aphek	0	These are the names of places. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:2	in3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed	0	This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: “the Philistines defeated the Israelites and killed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:2	c78l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	about four thousand men	0	Here the number four thousand is a round number. There may have been a few more than that or a few less than that. The word “about” shows that it is not an exact number. Alternate translation: “about 4,000 men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
4:3	v2ec			the people	0	the soldiers who had been fighting the battle
4:3	d9z9			Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring & enemies	0	The elders truly did not know why Yahweh had defeated them, but they wrongly thought they knew how to make sure it did not happen again, by bringing the ark to be with them.
4:4	s4ks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	who sits above the cherubim	0	You may need to make explicit that the cherubim are those on the lid of the ark of the covenant. The biblical writers often spoke of the ark of the covenant as if it were Yahweh’s footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. Alternate translation: “who sits on his throne above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:4	vz4l			Phinehas	0	This Phinehas is not the same as the grandson of Aaron in Exodus and Numbers.

4:5	ym2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp	0	“When the people carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh into the camp” Some languages may need to add understood information to make the meaning clear.

4:7	hw97			they said & They said	0	“they said to themselves … They said to each other” or “they said to each other … They said to each other.” The second clause clearly refers to what the Philistines said to each other. The first clause probably refers to what they thought, though it could also refer to what they said to each other. If possible, avoid stating who was spoken to.
4:7	n37y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	A god has come	0	The Philistines worshiped many gods, so they probably believed that one of those gods, or one whom they did not worship, had come into the camp. Another possible meaning is that they were speaking the proper name of the God of Israel: “Yahweh has come.” Because 4:8 speaks of “gods,” some translations read, “Gods have come,” that is, “It is gods who have come.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
4:8	xaq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Who will protect us from the strength of these mighty gods?	0	This rhetorical question is an expression of deep fear.

4:8	rx6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	these mighty gods & the gods who attacked	0	Because the word “god” (or “God”) in 4:7 is singular, many translations read “this mighty god … the god who attacked,” referring to any one of many possible gods, or “this mighty God … the God who attacked,” using the proper name of the God of Israel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
4:9	b9tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	be men	0	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “be strong and fight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

4:11	s6sx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	The ark of God was taken	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:17	q67g			Israel fled from the Philistines	0	This is a general statement about what happened. The rest of the man’s words give details.
4:17	knm8			Also, there has been & people. Also, your two sons	0	Alternate translation: “I will now tell you something worse … I will now tell you something worse” or “Not only has there been … people, but your two sons”
4:17	b1fy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	the ark of God has been taken	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Saul fought the Amalekites and killed all the people except the king. He destroyed the animals that were not very good but saved the best animals. Saul told Samuel he had obeyed God’s command. Samuel asked him about the animals Saul had. Saul said he had saved them for a sacrifice to God. God said that obedience was better than sacrifice. Because Saul had disobeyed him, God had chosen someone else to become king.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Idiom\n“He has turned back from following me” is an idiom meaning “he has stopped obeying me.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\nWhen Saul insisted that he had obeyed God, Samuel rebuked him with these rhetorical questions: “What then is this bleating of sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen that I hear?”; “Though you are little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel?”; “Why then did you not obey the voice of Yahweh, but instead you seized the booty and did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh?”; and “Has Yahweh as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

18:intro	abci				0	# 1 Samuel 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis is the first chapter of a section explaining why Saul wants to kill David.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 18:7.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Saul is jealous of David’s popularity\nSaul’s son, Jonathan, loves David. David is successful in battling the Philistines, and Saul is happy until the women give David more attention than they give him. He fears that David will replace him as king. This is potentially confusing because the author has already established that David will be the next king. It is probably that Saul feared David would kill him in order to be the next king sooner, or that he did not really believe David would be the next king. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/love]])\n\n### Jonathan’s love of David\nSome scholars believe Jonathan loved David as a man loves his wife. There is no reason to translate this as if Jonathan were a homosexual. Instead, treat this as a brotherly type of love.
