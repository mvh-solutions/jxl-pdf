Closing (13:11–13)\n\n### Who wrote the book of 2 Corinthians?\n\nThe author identifies himself as Paul the apostle. Paul was originally from the city of Tarsus but lived in Jerusalem. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee, and he persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. Paul first visited the Corinthians during his third time traveling around the Roman Empire (see [Acts 18:1–18](../act/18/01.md)). After he visited them, he stayed in the city of Ephesus for more than two years (see [Acts 19:1–10](../act/19/01.md)).\n\nFrom Ephesus, he wrote them a letter that we call First Corinthians. After he wrote that letter, and during the two years that he lived in Ephesus, he visited the Corinthians very briefly, but it was a painful visit (see [2:1](../02/01.md)). After this visit, he wrote two letters to the Corinthians. We do not have the first letter that Paul wrote, but it was a severe letter that may have grieved the Corinthians (see [2:4](../02/04.md)). The second letter that Paul wrote is this letter, Second Corinthians. He wrote it from the region of Macedonia after his friend Titus returned from visiting the Corinthians and told him how the Corinthians were doing.\n\n### What is the book of 2 Corinthians about?\n\nPaul wrote 2 Corinthians to continue to help the Corinthians believe the true gospel and trust him as an apostle of Christ. He wrote this letter after Titus returned to Paul from visiting the Corinthians and delivering to them a letter of strong rebuke from Paul. In 2 Corinthians, Paul tells the Corinthians that he is happy that they have responded well to his letter. However, he still has instructions and corrections to write to them, and he continues to defend himself as an apostle who taught them the true gospel. Most generally, Paul wrote 2 Corinthians to strengthen his relationship with the Corinthians, to strengthen relationships between all Christians, and to help the Christians trust in and obey Christ more and more.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Second Corinthians” or “2 Corinthians.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to the Church in Corinth” or “A Second Letter to the Christians in Corinth.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the city of Corinth like?\n\nCorinth was a major city located in ancient Greece. Because it was near the Mediterranean Sea and in an important location, many travelers and traders came to buy and sell goods there. Therefore, many different kinds of people lived in the city, and there were many wealthy people. Also, people in Corinth worshiped many different gods, and their worship could include food and sexual activity. In this culture, Christians who did not participate in worshiping at least some of the many gods were often considered to be strange, and people did not want to associate with them.\n\n### What were the issues that Paul was addressing in this letter?\n\nThere are four major issues about which Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians. First, he decided not to visit the Corinthians again right away, even though that was his original plan. He wanted to tell the Corinthians that he had changed his plans and to show them that he was not making promises and then breaking them. Second, Paul and the Corinthians had a conflict or fight when Paul visited them. Paul wished to rebuild their relationship so that they could trust and care for each other. Third, Paul wanted to encourage the Corinthians to give money to help the believers in Jerusalem. Paul was collecting this money from many churches he knew, and he wanted the Corinthians to contribute generously. Fourth, some people were saying that Paul was not really a true apostle, and the message he preached was not the true gospel. These people were either visitors or lived in Corinth. Paul defended himself and the gospel that he preached against these people who opposed him. All four of these issues relate to one specific problem: the Corinthians were doubting Paul’s authority over and care for them. He wrote 2 Corinthians to address this primary issue, and he focused on these four specific themes.\n\n### Who were the false teachers that Paul speaks about?\n\nEverything we know about the false teachers who opposed Paul in Corinth comes from this letter. So, we do not know for sure who they were. Paul refers to them with two especially important names: “super-apostles” and “false apostles.” Some scholars think that the super-apostles were some of the twelve apostles that Jesus appointed, while the false apostles were people who were not actually apostles but claimed to be. On the other hand, many scholars think that these two names refer to the same group of people: false teachers who claimed to be apostles but were not actually apostles. Paul does not carefully distinguish the names; this second view is probably correct. Paul implies that these false teachers were Jewish people who claimed to serve Christ (see [11:22–23](../11/22.md)). They claimed to have authority and power. However, we do not know what exactly they were teaching about Jesus. We do know that they claimed that their gospel was better than what Paul preached, but Paul tells us that what they were teaching was wrong.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What letters did Paul write to the Corinthians?\n\nPaul wrote at least four letters to the believers in Corinth. First, he wrote a letter related to avoiding sexual immorality (see [1 Corinthians 5:9](../1co/10509.md)). We do not have this letter. Second, he wrote a letter to the Corinthians that answered some of their questions and that addressed disputes within the Corinthian church. This letter is now known as First Corinthians. Third, Paul wrote a stern or “severe” letter to the Corinthians (see [2:3–4](../02/03.md) and [7:8–12](../07/08.md)). We again do not have this letter. Fourth, Paul wrote a letter after his friend Titus came from Corinth and told him that the Corinthians had responded well to the “severe letter.” This letter is now known as Second Corinthians.\n\n### About what visits to the Corinthians does Paul speak?\n\nWhile Paul does not directly mention it in 2 Corinthians, he first visited the Corinthians to proclaim the gospel to them. You can read about that in [Acts 18:1–18](../act/18/01.md). In 2 Corinthians, Paul briefly refers to his second visit to the Corinthians, which was “sorrowful” or “painful” (see [2:1](../02/01.md)). Sometime after this “painful” visit, Titus visited the Corinthians and then returned to Paul in Macedonia (see [2:12–13](../02/12.md) and [7:6–7](../07/06.md)). He probably took Paul’s “severe letter” with him. This may be the same visit of Titus that Paul refers to in [8:6](../08/06.md) and [12:18](../12/18.md), although either or both of these verses could refer instead to Titus taking this letter, 2 Corinthians, to the Corinthians.\n\nPaul also refers to two visits that had not yet happened when he wrote 2 Corinthians. First, Paul has asked Titus and two unnamed fellow believers to visit the Corinthians, taking the 2 Corinthians letter with them ([8:16–24](../08/16.md) and [9:3](../09/03.md)). Second, Paul plans to visit the Corinthians for a third time ([12:14](../12/14.md) and [13:1](../13/01.md)). You will need to make sure that your translation uses appropriate verb tenses and forms for referring to these visits. See the notes on specific verses for details and translation options.\n\n### How does Paul use irony and sarcasm?\n\nIn many places in this letter, Paul uses irony and sarcasm. In these places, he says things that he does not actually believe to be true. Usually, he is speaking from the perspective of other people and saying what they believe to be true. He does this to respond to what other people are saying or to show that what other people are saying is foolish or silly. The ULT often indicates that Paul is using irony or sarcasm by including quotation marks around the words that Paul does not actually believe to be true. The UST often indicates that Paul is using irony or sarcasm by indicating that someone is speaking the words. Consider how you might present sarcasm and irony in your language, and see the notes for places where Paul is using irony. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### What does Paul mean when he speaks about boasting?\n\nIn Paul’s culture, not all boasting was considered bad. Instead, there were good and bad kinds of boasting. In this letter, Paul explains what counts as good boasting, and he explains that he boasts in a good way. He also implies that his opponents boast in a bad way. Paul thinks the best way to boast is to say great things about God and what God has done. However, in this letter Paul also boasts about himself, because his opponents, the false teachers, boast about themselves. He does not think that this boasting is the best way for him to be speaking to the Corinthians, but he does it to respond to his opponents and to show the Corinthians that he is a true apostle of Christ. He calls this boasting foolish. Consider how you might express both good, bad, and foolish kinds of boasting. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/boast]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nPaul frequently uses the spatial metaphor “in Christ” (often with another name for Christ, such as Lord or Jesus) in this letter. This metaphor emphasizes that believers are as closely united to Christ as if they were inside him. Paul believes that this is true for all believers, and sometimes he uses “in Christ” simply to identify that what he is speaking about is true for those who believe in Jesus. Other times, he emphasizes union with Christ as the means or the basis for some statement or exhortation. See the notes on specific verses for help in understanding the contextual meaning of “in Christ” and related phrases. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### How should “brothers” be translated?\n\nMany times in this letter, Paul directly addresses or refers to people he calls “brothers.” The plural form, “brothers,” refers in general to fellow believers, both men and women. The singular form, “brother,” refers to a specific fellow believer, almost certainly one who is a man. Paul uses this word because he considers believers to be as closely united together as siblings in a family. Consider what word or phrase would best express both the reference to fellow believers and the idea that these fellow believers are as close as family members. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])\n\n### How should “you” and “we” be translated?\n\nThroughout the letter, you should assume that “you,” “your,” and “yours” are plural and refer to the Corinthian believers unless a note specifies that the form of “you” is singular. Also, throughout the letter, you should assume that “we,” “us,” “our,” and “ours” include Paul and those who work with Paul but do not include the Corinthian believers unless a notes specifies that the form of “we” includes the Corinthian believers. Some scholars think that Paul sometimes uses the first person plural to refer to only himself. Other scholars think that Paul uses the first person plural to refer to both himself and those who serve with him. There is often not enough evidence be certain of which meaning Paul intended. It is recommended that you preserve how Paul sometimes uses the first person singular and sometimes uses the first person plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of 2 Corinthians?\n\nIn the following verses, ancient manuscripts do not all have the same words. The ULT uses the words that are found in most of the earliest manuscripts. When you translate these verses, you should compare the ULT with any translations with which your readers may be familiar to see what your readers may expect. Unless there is a good reason to use the alternate words, you should follow the ULT. See the footnotes and notes at each of these verses for more information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n* “in holiness” ([1:12](../01/12.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “in sincerity.”\n* “a second grace” ([1:15](../01/15.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “a second joy.”\n* “new things have come” ([5:17](../05/17.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “all {things} have become new.”\n* “I see” ([7:8](../07/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “for I see.” Other ancient manuscripts have this: “seeing.”\n* “and in the love from us in you” ([8:7](../08/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “and in your love for us.”\n* “by this situation” ([9:4](../09/04.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “by this situation of boasting.”\n* “so that he might buffet me, so that I would not become super arrogant” ([12:7](../12/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “so that he might buffet me.”\n* “If loving you” ([12:15](../12/15.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “If I love you.”\n* “[12] Greet each other with a holy kiss. All the saints greet you. [13] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit {be} with all of you.” ([13:12–13](../13/12.md)). Some translations divide these sentences up into 3 verses instead of 2: “[12] Greet each other with a holy kiss. [13] All the saints greet you. [14] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit {be} with all of you.”
1:intro	tsh3				0	# 2 Corinthians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Opening and blessing (1:1–2)\n2. Paul praises God for his comfort in affliction (1:3–11)\n3. Interrupted travel plans (1:12–2:13)\n     * The interruption and the reason for it (1:15–2:4)\n\nThe first paragraph reflects a common way to begin a letter in the ancient Near East.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Comfort\n\nComfort is a major theme of this chapter. Paul explains that believers experience affliction because they belong to Jesus. When this happens, the Holy Spirit comforts them. Then they are able to comfort others. Paul wants the Corinthian believers to know that he is not exempt from terrible persecution but that God always rescues and comforts him as well. He also wants them to know that God will do the same for them.\n\n### Paul’s integrity\n\nApparently, people in Corinth had been criticizing Paul, saying that he was not sincere and did not truly care about the Corinthian believers. Therefore, Paul refutes them by explaining his motives for what he was doing.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical question\n\nPaul uses two rhetorical questions in 1:17 to defend himself against a charge of not being sincere. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Metaphorical “Yes and No”\n\nIn 1:17-20 Paul uses the words “yes” and “no” together to represent the attitudes and speech of a person who is unstable and easily changes his mind about what he wants to do. It seems that some people had been accusing Paul of being such a person, but he makes it clear that he is not. Instead, he imitates God, who is always faithful, and Jesus, who faithfully fulfills all of the promises of God.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Holy Spirit as guarantee\n\nIn 1:22 Paul says that the Holy Spirit is the guarantee of all of God’s promises, including eternal life with him. The term “guarantee” comes from business deals in which a person gives some valuable item to another person as a guarantee that the first person will pay the full amount of money that he owes. Other words for this idea include “pledge” or “down-payment.” Paul uses this idea to explain that, because believers experience the blessings of the Holy Spirit now, they can be sure that they will experience all of God’s given promises after they die. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n### God as witness\n\nIn 1:23 Paul calls God to be a witness to his character, that he is being honest and faithful to the Corinthian believers. It is probable that Paul means this as an oath, in which it is expected that God would bear witness to what Paul is saying by dramatically punishing him or striking him dead if he is lying. Alternatively, he may intend that God will bear witness by affirming Paul's honesty to the Corinthian believers through the Holy Spirit.

1:21	tjc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χρίσας ἡμᾶς	1	The implication is that God has anointed believers with the Holy Spirit so that they can live for him. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “having anointed us with the Holy Spirit to live for him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:21	f4c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	2	Here, **us** probably includes the Corinthian believers, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:22	z43l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σφραγισάμενος ἡμᾶς	1	Paul speaks of God showing that we belong to him as if God had put a visible mark of ownership on us. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having claimed us as his own” or “having shown that we belong to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:22	laq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & ἡμῶν	1	Here, **us** and **our** include Paul and all believers, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:22	jcv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, Paul is speaking of **the Spirit** as if the Spirit were a **down payment**, that is, a partial payment for a purchase with a promise to pay the rest of the amount on a future date. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a guarantee that he will also give us every blessing that he has promised to us, which is the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:22	xe98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	Here the word **hearts** refers to the innermost part of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in our innermost beings” or “to live within each of us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:23	j8lc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	ἐγὼ δὲ μάρτυρα τὸν Θεὸν ἐπικαλοῦμαι ἐπὶ τὴν ἐμὴν ψυχήν	1	The phrase **I invoke God as a witness upon my soul** could be: (1) an oath formula. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. Alternate translation: “Now I swear to God upon my soul” (2) simply a statement that God knows Paul’s motives. Alternate translation: “Now I call upon God as a witness to my intentions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula]])
1:23	vrkv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐγὼ δὲ μάρτυρα τὸν Θεὸν ἐπικαλοῦμαι ἐπὶ τὴν ἐμὴν ψυχήν	1	Here, **soul** represents the life of the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “So may God take my life if I am lying, but he knows” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:23	j15t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ὅτι φειδόμενος ὑμῶν	1	Here, **that** introduces a goal or purpose relationship. The purpose for which Paul canceled his visit to Corinth was to spare causing pain to the Corinthian believers (see 2:1). Use a connector or phrase in your language that makes it clear that this is the purpose. Alternate translation: “that it was in order to spare you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:23	xzir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὅτι φειδόμενος ὑμῶν οὐκέτι ἦλθον εἰς Κόρινθον	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “that it was in order to spare you sorrow that I have not yet come to Corinth” or “that it was to keep from grieving you that I have not yet traveled to Corinth again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:24	hepi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐχ ὅτι	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “I do not mean that” or “I do not say that because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:24	mrzw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κυριεύομεν	1	Here, **lord it over** is an idiom that means “act like the masters of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “we want to be in charge of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:24	hafq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κυριεύομεν ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Here, **faith** could mean: (1) what the Corinthians believe. Alternate translation: “we dictate to you what you must believe” (2) how the Corinthians relate to God. Alternate translation: “we are in charge of your relationship to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:24	lz4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	συνεργοί ἐσμεν	1	Here the pronoun **we** could refer to: (1) Paul and his companions, but not the Corinthian believers. (2) Paul, his companions, and the Corinthian believers. We recommend using the exclusive form here if your language marks that distinction, to be the same as the previous “we” in this verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:24	cyu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς χαρᾶς ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that you will be joyful” or “to make you happy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:24	kv47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, **for** connects the following statement as a reason for the previous two statements. Use a natural form in your language for connecting this statement to the previous ones as the reason. Alternate translation: “since” or “because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1:24	cih8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἑστήκατε	1	Here, **stand firm** means to be steady, resolute, or established. Alternate translation: “you are well established” or “you are strong and steady” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:24	xf2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ & πίστει	1	Here, **in the faith** could mean: (1) “in regard to your faith.” In other words, the Corinthian believers are independent of Paul in regard to their faith. They are responsible only to God for what they believe and do. Alternate translation: “concerning your commitment to God” (2) “because of your faith.” In other words, the Corinthian believers continue to belong to God because of their faith, not because of Paul’s authority. Alternate translation: “because you trust in God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:intro	hy3h				0	# 2 Corinthians 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Interrupted travel plans (1:15–2:13)\n     * The interruption and the reason for it (1:15–2:4)\n     * The person who caused grief (2:5–11)\n     * Travel to Troas and Macedonia (2:12–13)\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * The fragrance of Christ (2:14–17)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The previous letter\n\nIn [2:3–4](../02/03.md), [9](../02/09.md), Paul refers to a letter that he had already written and sent to the Corinthians. While a few scholars think this letter is 1 Corinthians, most likely we do not have this previous letter. Paul acknowledges that this previous letter might have “grieved” them, but he wants them to know that he wrote the letter because of his love for them. In your translation, make sure that these verses refer to a letter that Paul previously wrote, not to 2 Corinthians.\n\n### “Grieving” others\n\nPaul refers to “sorrow,” “grief,” and “grieving” others multiple times in [2:1–8](../02/01.md). These words refer to how people who are close friends can “grieve” or hurt each other by what they say and do. These words do not refer to physically hurting someone. Rather, they refer to hurting someone emotionally. Paul acknowledges that his letter might have “grieved” them, and he also indicates that one of the Corinthians has “grieved” fellow believers. Consider a natural way to refer to one person hurting or injuring another person inside.\n\n### The person who caused grief\n\nIn [2:5–11](../02/05.md), Paul refers to a person who has caused grief. Almost certainly, he has one specific person in mind. Paul is not clear about what this person did to cause the grief. He or she may have committed a sexual sin or stolen money from the church or opposed Paul’s authority. Whatever the person did, Paul chooses not to be specific about the person or what he or she did. Perhaps this is because he wants the Corinthians to forgive and show love to this person now that he or she has been properly disciplined by the church. In your translation, use general words for both the person and what the person did.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Aroma and fragrance\n\nIn [2:14–16](../02/14.md), Paul identifies himself and those who serve with him as an “aroma” or “fragrance.” Paul could be thinking in general of smells and odors, or he could be referring to the smell from incense and sacrifices offered during a “triumphal procession” (see [2:14](../02/14.md)), or he could be referring to the smell from sacrifices offered at the temple. Whatever exact smells Paul has in mind, he is clear that he and his fellow workers are a smell that comes from Christ, and people react to it very differently: some think it is the smell of death, while others think it is the smell of life. Paul speaks in this way because smells spread throughout a whole area, and people have to react to them. Just as smells spread, he and his fellow workers spread the gospel throughout the world, and people have to respond to it. Further, just as some people like a smell and others hate it, so some people believe the gospel and receive life from God, while others reject the gospel and perish. If possible, preserve the “aroma” and “fragrance” language. If necessary, you could use a simile to express the idea. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paul’s use of pronouns\n\nIn [2:1–13](../02/01.md), Paul consistently uses the first person singular to refer to himself and the second person plural to refer to the Corinthians. The only exception is in [2:11](../02/11.md), where Paul uses “we” to refer to himself and the Corinthians. However, in [2:14–17](../02/14.md), Paul uses “we” to refer to himself and those preaching the gospel with him. In these verses, “we” does not include the Corinthians. It is unclear exactly whom Paul includes in “we”: it could be just he and Titus, or he and the group that works with him, or he and everyone else who preaches the gospel. Consider natural ways to represent these changes in reference throughout the chapter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Paul’s travel\n\nIn [2:12–13](../02/12.md), Paul describes some of his travels. Troas is a city on the west coast of what is now Turkey. Since Troas was a port city, most likely Paul sailed from there to Macedonia, which is the northern part of what is now Greece. Since Corinth is in southern Greece, Paul was not too far away from the Corinthians. Paul continues the description of what happened in Macedonia in [7:5–7](../07/05.md). Consider what information your readers need to know to understand Paul’s travels, and include what is necessary in your translation or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/troas]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/macedonia]])
2:1	wh9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what Paul said in [1:23](../01/23.md) about the reason why he did not visit Corinth, which was to spare them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “Here is why I have not come to Corinth:” or “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:1	wpd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐμαυτῷ τοῦτο τὸ μὴ	1	Here, the word **this** refers ahead to what Paul is about to say: **not to come to you again in sorrow**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **this** refers to explicit, or you could rephrase the sentence so that you do not use **this**. Alternate translation: “for myself what follows: not” or “for myself not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:1	yz5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐμαυτῷ	1	Here the phrase **for myself** indicates that Paul made this choice because of reasons he thought about. In other words, he was not forced to make this choice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that someone made their own choice or decision. Alternate translation: “on my own” or “in my own mind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:1	yrbk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	τὸ μὴ & ἐλθεῖν	1	In a context such as this, it may be more natural in your language to say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “not to go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:1	ma6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν	1	Here, the word **again** implies that Paul has already visited the Corinthians **in sorrow**. He does not give many details about this visit. It cannot be the first time that he visited the Corinthians, so he must have visited them again **in sorrow** sometime between when he first met them and when he wrote this letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implication more explicit. Alternate translation: “a second time” or “yet again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:1	hu8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν λύπῃ	1	Here the ones who experience the **sorrow** could be: (1) Paul and the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “in sorrow for all of us” (2) just the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “in sorrow for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:1	ij73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν λύπῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sorrow**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sorrowful” or “sad.” Alternate translation: “in a sorrowful way” or “in a way that makes us sad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	jb50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul is avoiding the “sorrow” he mentioned in [2:1](../02/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “I decided that because” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:2	q4aq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ & ἐγὼ λυπῶ ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul refers to a situation that has not happened and which he intends to keep from happening. He refers to the situation using the conditional form to indicate what would result from the situation if it did happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to something that may not happen but that the author wishes to speak about. Alternate translation: “supposing that I myself grieved you” or “were I myself to grieve you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
2:2	le34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἐγὼ λυπῶ	1	Here, the word **myself** emphasizes **I**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **I** in your language. Alternate translation: “it is I myself who grieve” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
2:2	nb6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καὶ τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με, εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “there is no one else.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “then there is no one cheering me up, except the one being grieved by me.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:2	mbbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με, εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος	1	Here the author uses the singular form **the one** to refer in general to people, particularly to the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers in general to people. Alternate translation: “who are those cheering me up, except those being grieved” or “who are those cheering me up, except you who are being grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:2	mbag		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	τίς ὁ εὐφραίνων με, εἰ μὴ ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ	1	If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this question to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “is it not the one being grieved by me who is the only one cheering me up” or “is there any one cheering me up besides the one being grieved by me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
2:2	x2vr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ λυπούμενος ἐξ ἐμοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the one whom I have grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:3	kxu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγραψα	1	Here Paul refers to a letter he had already written to the Corinthians. Most likely, he wrote this letter sometime between when he wrote 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians, but we do not have the letter, so we do not know for sure. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that Paul is referring to a letter that he already sent to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my last letter” or “I sent you the previous letter, which that said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:3	e7c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο αὐτὸ	1	Here, the phrase **this same thing** refers to what Paul wrote in the previous letter. He could be referring to: (1) what he just wrote in [2:1–2](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: “the same thing I am now writing” (2) the contents of the previous letter in general. Alternate translation: “those things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:3	abty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐλθὼν	1	Here, the phrase **having come** refers to an event that is still in the future for Paul but that would happen at the same time as **I might not have sorrow**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that happens at the same time as another event in the future. Alternate translation: “whenever I came” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
2:3	v87i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ & λύπην σχῶ ἀφ’	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sorrow**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sorrowful” or “sad.” Alternate translation: “I might not become sorrowful because of” or “I might not be sad because of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:3	owzn			ἀφ’ ὧν ἔδει με χαίρειν	1	Here, this clause could indicate that **it is necessary** for: (1) Paul to **rejoice** in the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “from those in which it is necessary for me to rejoice” (2) the Corinthians to give “joy” to Paul. Alternate translation: “from those for whom it is necessary to give me joy”
2:3	p4q2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πεποιθὼς	1	Here, the phrase **having confidence** introduces a reason why Paul **wrote** the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “because I had confidence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:3	b6f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πεποιθὼς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **confidence**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “confident.” Alternate translation: “being confident” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:3	i5r6			ἡ ἐμὴ χαρὰ πάντων ὑμῶν ἐστιν	1	Here Paul could be stating that his **joy**: (1) leads to the Corinthians’ joy. Alternate translation: “my joy leads to your joy” (2) has the same source as the Corinthians’ joy. Alternate translation: “what gives me joy is what gives you joy” (3) comes from the Corinthians’ joy. Alternate translation: “my joy comes from your joy”
2:3	gmyo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἐμὴ χαρὰ πάντων ὑμῶν ἐστιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rejoice” or an adjective such as “joyful.” Alternate translation: “I am joyful, and so you are joyful” or “I rejoice, and so you rejoice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	p4n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation about the letter that Paul **wrote** to them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “As it is,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:4	tl4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔγραψα	1	Here, the phrase **I wrote** again refers to the previous letter. See how you translated “I wrote” in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “I wrote that letter” or “I sent that previous letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	oz8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ & πολλῆς θλίψεως καὶ συνοχῆς καρδίας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **tribulation** and **anguish**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “suffer” and “distress.” Alternate translation: “as I suffered much and was distressed in my heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	vs7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	συνοχῆς καρδίας	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “anguish of mind” or “emotional anguish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:4	d5vf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διὰ πολλῶν δακρύων	1	Here, the phrase **through many tears** indicates what Paul was doing while he **wrote** the letter. The word **tears** refers to the act of crying or weeping. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that a person is crying or weeping while they are doing something. Alternate translation: “with much crying” or “as I shed many tears” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:4	y0t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐχ ἵνα λυπηθῆτε, ἀλλὰ τὴν ἀγάπην ἵνα γνῶτε, ἣν ἔχω περισσοτέρως εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the two clauses here. Alternate translation: “so that you might know the love that I have more abundantly for you, not so that you would be grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:4	uc77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λυπηθῆτε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who would do the action, the Paul implies that “he himself” would do it. Alternate translation: “I would grieve you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:4	g826		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην & ἣν ἔχω περισσοτέρως εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “how abundantly I love you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	zw13			περισσοτέρως εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the phrase **more abundantly** could indicate that: (1) Paul has “abundant” love for the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “most abundantly for you” or “very abundantly for you” (2) Paul loves the Corinthians more than he loves other people. Alternate translation: “more abundantly for you than I have for others”
2:5	xomm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δέ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how Paul did not want to “grieve” them. Here he addresses how someone has **caused grief**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “However,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:5	xlxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & τις λελύπηκεν, οὐκ & λελύπηκεν	1	Here Paul is speaking as if someone causing **grief** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by indicating that someone has indeed **caused grief**. Alternate translation: “the person who caused grief has not grieved only” or “if anyone has caused grief, and it has happened, he has not grieved only” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2:5	ln83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	λελύπηκεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grief**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “grieve.” Alternate translation: “has grieved people” or “has caused others to grieve” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:5	j6bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὐκ & λελύπηκεν	1	Here, Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has **grieved** others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “that individual has not grieved only” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:5	d7fx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐμὲ λελύπηκεν	1	Here Paul could be indicating that the person has: (1) **grieved** Paul some, but mostly the person has **grieved** the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “he has not grieved me much” (2) not **grieved** Paul at all but only the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “he has not grieved me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:5	rvpt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ μέρους	1	Here, the phrase **in part** indicates that only some of an action or group is involved. In this case, Paul could be using **in part** to refer to: (1) how many of the Corinthians have been **grieved**. Alternate translation: “some of you” or “part of your group” (2) how much the Corinthians have been **grieved**. Alternate translation: “he has partially grieved you” or “you also in part” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:5	iva7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἀπὸ μέρους, ἵνα μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ πάντας ὑμᾶς	1	There are several ways to understand how the pieces of the sentence go together. You could translate the sentence so that: (1) **in order that I might not burden all of you** indicates the reason why Paul uses the phrase **in part**, which would refer to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “you in part, which I say so that I might not burden all of you” (2) **in part** and **all of you** go together, and **in order that I might not burden** is a parenthetical statement explaining why Paul says **in part**. Alternate translation: “in part—which I say so that I might not burden—all of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:5	or46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ ἐπιβαρῶ	1	Here, to **burden** someone refers to placing a heavy object on someone’s back. Paul could be using the phrase **I might not burden** to refer to: (1) how he is trying to avoid saying too much about the situation. In other words, Paul uses the phrase **in part** because he does not want to make his words too strong, which would make the words like a person carrying a heavy load. Alternate translation: “I might not say too much about” or “I might not exaggerate about” (2) how he wants to avoid troubling or distressing all of them, which would be like “burdening” them with a heavy object. Alternate translation: “I might not distress” or “I might not trouble” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:6	iy4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἡ ἐπιτιμία αὕτη	1	Here, the word **This** indicates that both Paul and the Corinthians knew what the **punishment** was. However, Paul never states exactly what the punishment was. You should use a word or phrase that is as general as what Paul used. Alternate translation: “That punishment” or “The punishment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:6	g3eo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῷ τοιούτῳ	1	Here Paul speaks in general terms about **such a {person}**. However, he is referring more specifically to the person that he mentioned in the previous verse, the one who “grieved” the Corinthians (see [2:5](../02/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this reference more explicit. Alternate translation: “on the person we are talking about” or “on that individual” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:6	d7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τῶν πλειόνων	1	Here the phrase **the majority** implies a “minority.” These are some of the Corinthians who either did not agree with the **punishment** or who thought that the person had done nothing wrong. However, Paul does not give any information about this “minority,” so you should use a word or phrase that refers to most of the people in a group. Alternate translation: “all but a few of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:6	a7c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἱκανὸν	1	Here, the word **sufficient** could indicate that the **punishment**: (1) has been severe enough. Alternate translation: “is severe enough” or “is sufficiently strong” (2) has lasted long enough. Alternate translation: “has lasted long enough” or “can end now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:7	we1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τοὐναντίον μᾶλλον ὑμᾶς χαρίσασθαι	1	Here, the words **on the contrary** and **rather** indicate that Paul wishes the Corinthians to do now the opposite of what they were doing. Instead of “punishing” the person, Paul wants them now to **forgive and comfort** the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that naturally indicate such a change in behavior. Alternate translation: “in contrast, you should instead forgive” or “instead of doing that, you should change your behavior and forgive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:7	w4n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	παρακαλέσαι & τῇ	1	Here, just as in [2:5](../02/05.md), Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has “grieved” others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “comfort the individual … any” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:7	vpx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μή πως τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ, καταποθῇ ὁ τοιοῦτος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “so that excessive sorrow might not overwhelm such a person” or “so that such a person might not experience overwhelming and excessive sorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:7	i3dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μή πως τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ καταποθῇ ὁ τοιοῦτος	1	Here Paul speaks as if a person could be **overwhelmed** or swallowed up by **sorrow**. He speaks in this way to indicate that a person can experience so much **sorrow** that it controls and destroys them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “so that such a person might not be overcome by excessive sorrow” or “so that such a person might not despair because of his excessive sorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	me4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ τοιοῦτος	1	Here Paul speaks in general terms about **such a {person}**. However, he is referring more specifically to the person that he has already mentioned, the one who “grieved” the Corinthians (see [2:5](../02/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this reference more explicit. See how you translated this phrase in [2:6](../02/06.md). Alternate translation: “the person we are talking about” or “that individual” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:7	cgil		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ περισσοτέρᾳ λύπῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sorrow**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sorrowful” or “sad.” Alternate translation: “as he is excessively sorrowful” or “because he is excessively sad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	r916		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ	1	Here, the word **So** introduces an exhortation that is based on what Paul said in the previous verse about “forgiving” and “comforting” the person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an exhortation or inference. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” or “So then,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:8	ii0x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	κυρῶσαι εἰς αὐτὸν ἀγάπην	1	Here, the phrase **for him** could go with: (1) **love**. Alternate translation: “to reaffirm the love that you have for him” (2) **reaffirm**. Alternate translation: “to reaffirm to him your love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:8	yi2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς & ἀγάπην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “that you love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	vlmy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸν	1	Here, just as in [2:5](../02/05.md), [7](../02/07.md), Paul may be referring specifically to a man, especially if the way that he has “grieved” others is by sinning sexually. However, it is not certain that Paul is referring to a man here. Consider using a form that does not specify the gender of this person. Alternate translation: “that individual” or “the person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:9	oadd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **Indeed** introduces more information about the letter that Paul wrote to them (see [2:3–4](../02/03.md)). It does not identify a close link with the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **Indeed** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact” or “As a matter of fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:9	lc78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἔγραψα	1	Here, the phrase **I also wrote** again refers to the letter that Paul sent to them before he wrote 2 Corinthians. See how you translated “I wrote” in [2:3–4](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “I also wrote that letter” or “I also sent that previous letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:9	pp4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	εἰς τοῦτο & ἵνα	1	Here, the phrases **for this reason** and **so that** both introduce the purpose for which Paul **wrote** the previous letter. Paul uses this repetition to emphasize his purpose. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, and if it would not emphasize the purpose, you could combine the two phrases and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “so that” or “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:9	eebj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1	Here, the word **proof** refers primarily to the results of a test or trial. In this case, Paul is saying that he wants to **know** how they did on the test, which were the commands he included in the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the results of a test. Alternate translation: “how you responded to my commands” or “your character” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:9	uzsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **proof** that the Corinthians give or provide. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the prove you provide” or “the proof from you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:9	gs2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δοκιμὴν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **proof**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “prove.” Alternate translation: “what you would prove to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:9	xw5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπήκοοί	1	Here, Paul does not state to whom they are **obedient**. He could be implying that they are **obedient** to: (1) him as an apostle. Alternate translation: “obedient to me” (2) God and God’s commands. Alternate translation: “obedient to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	r7ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development in Paul’s argument. In this case, Paul is concluding his discussion about the previous letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development or a conclusion, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Finally,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:10	o14x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ᾧ & τι χαρίζεσθε, κἀγώ	1	Here Paul could be making: (1) a specific statement about forgiving the person who “grieved” the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “to that person to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive” (2) a general concluding statement about forgiveness. Alternate translation: “to any person to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	uzvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	κἀγώ	1	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “I also forgive it” or “I also forgive them for it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:10	tzn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **for indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous clause (**for**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “furthermore,” or “and in fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:10	d9ah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ γὰρ ἐγὼ ὃ κεχάρισμαι, εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι, δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul includes the comment **if I have forgiven anything** in the middle of his sentence. Consider what may be a natural place to include extra information like this. Alternate translation: “for indeed, if I have forgiven anything, what I have forgiven is for your sake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:10	avqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴ τι κεχάρισμαι	1	This clarification fits with what Paul said in [2:5](../02/05.md) about how the person did not “grieve” him but rather the Corinthians. Paul could be saying that: (1) he does not have very much to forgive, since the person only hurt him a little. Alternate translation: “what little I had to forgive” (2) he really has nothing to forgive, since the person hurt the Corinthians, not him. Alternate translation: “although I have nothing to forgive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	cbm6			δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the phrase **for your sake** could mean that: (1) Paul forgives the person in order to benefit or help the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “is for your benefit” (2) Paul forgives the person because the Corinthians forgave him. Alternate translation: “is because of you” or “is because you forgave”
2:10	b6uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν προσώπῳ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **in the presence of Christ** could indicate that: (1) Paul forgives because he knows that **Christ** sees or knows what he does. So, he acts in a way that pleases **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as Christ desires” or “with Christ watching” (2) Paul forgives with **Christ** as witness. Alternate translation: “with Christ as witness” or “with Christ guaranteeing it” (3) Paul forgives as someone who represents **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as one who represents Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:11	xaoc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἵνα	1	Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which Paul and Corinthians should “forgive” others (see [2:10](../02/10.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:11	xoaw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ πλεονεκτηθῶμεν ὑπὸ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Satan would not take advantage of us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:11	z6no		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the first half of this verse about **Satan**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “because” or “inasmuch as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:11	m46t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ & αὐτοῦ τὰ νοήματα ἀγνοοῦμεν	1	Here the author uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “we are fully aware of his schemes” or “we are very knowledgeable about his schemes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
2:12	nh7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section. Paul has finished speaking about the person that he and the Corinthians should forgive. He now returns to the topic of his travel plans and why he has not visited the Corinthians (see [1:8–23](../01/08.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new topic or section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Moving on,” or “I wish to speak again about my journeys:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:12	l6vd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθὼν & εἰς	1	In a context such as this, it may be more natural in your language to say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “having gone to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:12	c14o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας & ἀνεῳγμένης	1	This clause gives information that contrasts with what Paul will say in the previous verse about how he left **Troas**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate this contrast with a natural form. Alternate translation: “and although a door for the gospel of Christ had been opened” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:12	a1ti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας μοι ἀνεῳγμένης	1	Here Paul speaks of God providing opportunities for him to preach the **gospel** as if God were “opening” a **door** for the **gospel**. The image is of God opening a door so that Paul can go in and preach the message about Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and an opportunity to preach the gospel of Christ having been given to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	n9cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ θύρας μοι ἀνεῳγμένης ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. In this case, Paul could be stating that the **Lord** did it, or he could be implying that “God” did it **in the Lord**. See the note about **in the Lord**. Alternate translation: “and the Lord having opened a door for the gospel of Christ for me” or “and God having opened a door for the gospel of Christ for me in the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:12	vtg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the gospel** that could: (1) be about **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the gospel concerning Christ” (2) belong to **Christ**. Alternate translation: “Christ’s gospel” or “the gospel from Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:12	fcf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe his union with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, shows that the **door** was **opened** to Paul: (1) by the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “by the Lord” (2) so that he could continue to serve in his union with the **Lord**. Alternate translation: “in my union with the Lord” or “so that I can do what the Lord wants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	m7x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Κυρίῳ	1	Here, the word **Lord** could refer to: (1) Jesus the Messiah. Alternate translation: “the Lord, the Messiah” (2) God generally. Alternate translation: “the Lord God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	rjy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1	Here, the clause **I had no relief in my spirit** indicates that Paul was anxious or concerned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable form or plain language. Alternate translation: “My mind could not rest” or “I was concerned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:13	k7k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1	Here Paul does not clarify what he was concerned or anxious about. He clarifies later in [7:5–16](../07/05.md) that he was anxious to know how Titus’ visit to the Corinthians went. The Corinthians would have made this inference, since Titus had already visited them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this information more explicit. Alternate translation: “I had no relief in my spirit about Titus’ visit to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	trp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔσχηκα ἄνεσιν τῷ πνεύματί μου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **relief**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “restful” or “relieved.” Alternate translation: “My spirit was not restful” or “My spirit was not relieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:13	w79i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ εὑρεῖν με Τίτον τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1	Here Paul is stating that **Titus** was not in Troas, not that he simply could not find him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that shows that **Titus** was not in the city of Troas when Paul visited there. Alternate translation: “as I found out that my brother Titus was not there” or “as my brother Titus was not in the city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	xd5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Τίτον τὸν ἀδελφόν μου	1	Here Paul speaks of **Titus** as if he were his **brother** (probably a younger **brother**). He speaks in this way to indicate that **Titus** is a fellow believer and that he and Paul are as close as if they were brothers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or plain language to express this idea. Alternate translation: “Titus, who is like my own brother,” or “my very dear friend and fellow believer Titus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:13	wq6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποταξάμενος αὐτοῖς	1	Here Paul refers to how he **said farewell** to the people from Troas, but he also means that he left their city. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having said farewell to them and departed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	j9je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	Here, the word **them** refers to the friends that Paul made in the city of “Troas” (see [2:12](../02/12.md)). Most likely, these people were fellow believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom **them** refers more explicit. Alternate translation: “to the people from Troas” or “to my friends in Troas” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:14	s6k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a new section. Paul will not speak again about Titus and his travel plans until [7:5](../07/05.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section or topic, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “But now,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:14	g39s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	τῷ & Θεῷ χάρις	1	Here, the phrase **thanks {be} to God** is an exclamatory phrase that communicates Paul’s thankfulness. Use an exclamation form that is natural in your language for communicating thanks. Alternate translation: “we thank God” or “we give glory to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
2:14	qgok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς & ἡμῶν	1	Here, the word **us** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “us who preach … us” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “me … me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:14	gpd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ πάντοτε θριαμβεύοντι ἡμᾶς	1	Here Paul speaks as if **God** were a leader who had won a victory and set up a parade or **triumphal procession** to celebrate. In this parade, Paul and his fellow workers could be either or both of the following: (1) prisoners who have been conquered and who are put in the parade to illustrate the victory. This is the normal meaning of the word in other places. Alternate translation: “always parading us as his captives” or “always showing that he leads us” (2) soldiers who helped win the victory and who are celebrating. This is not the normal meaning of the word, but it is possible and fits the context well. Alternate translation: “always having us participate in his triumphal parade” or “always helping us to conquer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	so2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ Χριστῷ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains why or how they are involved in the **triumphal procession**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that union with Christ is the reason or the means for participating in the **procession**. Alternate translation: “because of our union with Christ” or “by means of our union with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	l1nr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	τὴν ὀσμὴν τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ, φανεροῦντι δι’ ἡμῶν ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **the knowledge of him** were an **aroma**, a smell or odor. In this case, the context implies that this is a pleasing or good smell. He speaks in this way to indicate that everyone hears and reacts to the message about Christ, just like everyone smells and reacts to a strong odor. Also, just like a smell fills a whole room, so the good news fills **every place** on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a simile or plain language. Consider using a form that you can continue to use in the following two verses, in which Paul continues the **aroma** metaphor. Alternate translation: “making known through us and in every place the knowledge of him, which is like an good smell” or “powerfully revealing through us the knowledge of him, which is spreading into every place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:14	tlqe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ὀσμὴν τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe an **aroma** that is **knowledge**. In other words, the possessive indicates what the **aroma** stands for. Then, Paul indicates that this **knowledge** is about **him**, meaning Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “the aroma, which is knowledge about him” or “the aroma, that is, knowing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:14	ihbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς γνώσεως αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “know.” Alternate translation: “that is knowing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:14	lxlc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the word **him** could refer to: (1) God generally. Alternate translation: “of God” (2) Christ specifically. Alternate translation: “of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:14	eq21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Here Paul speaks as if God used him and his fellow workers to make God known **in every place**. The Corinthians would have understood him to mean that God uses them to make God known in many places, or in every place that they visit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea clearer. Alternate translation: “in every place we go” or “throughout the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:15	cjjj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse about “the aroma” ([2:14](../02/14.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “Here is what I mean:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:15	yfx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐσμὲν	1	Here, just as in [2:14](../02/14.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach are” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:15	x6nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	Χριστοῦ εὐωδία ἐσμὲν τῷ Θεῷ	1	Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (see [2:14](../02/14.md)). He identifies himself and his fellow workers as a **fragrance** that comes from **Christ** and which goes toward **God**. By speaking in this way, he shows that **we** are those who represent or declare who Christ is in the presence of God. Just like everyone smells a good smell and knows where it comes from, so everyone notices Paul and his fellow workers and realizes that they represent **Christ** before **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Make sure that your translation fits with the previous and the following verses. Alternate translation: “we are like a good odor that spreads from Christ before God” or “we represent Christ before God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:15	b1k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Χριστοῦ εὐωδία	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **fragrance** could: (1) come or spread from **Christ**. Alternate translation: “a fragrance from Christ” (2) be presented or offered by **Christ**. Alternate translation: “a fragrance that Christ presents” or “a fragrance that Christ offers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:15	itc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῖς σῳζομένοις	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that God does it. Alternate translation: “the ones whom God is saving” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:15	ze7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις	1	Christians disagree over whether God causes people to “perish” or whether people cause themselves to “perish.” The word that Paul uses here intentionally does not include the person who causes the **perishing**. If possible, your translation also should avoid stating who causes the “perishing.” Alternate translation: “the ones on the path to destruction” or “the ones who are not being saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:16	zrae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οἷς μὲν & οἷς δὲ	1	Here, the word translated as **indeed** indicates that the author is introducing the first of two parts. The word **but** introduces the second part. The author uses this form to contrast “the ones perishing” and “the ones being saved” (see [2:15](../02/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally contrasts two groups of people. Alternate translation: “on one hand, to the ones … but on the other hand, to the others” or “to the ones … but to the others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:16	pv6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οἷς μὲν ὀσμὴ ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον, οἷς δὲ ὀσμὴ ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1	Here Paul refers to “the ones perishing” before he refers to “the ones being saved,” which is the opposite of the order he used in [2:15](../02/15.md). This was good style in his culture. If reversing the order from [2:15](../02/15.md) would be confusing for your readers, and if it would not be good style, you could reverse the order here to match that in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: “to the ones indeed, an aroma from life to life, but to the others, an aroma from death to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:16	t3vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἷς	-1	Here, the phrase **to the ones** refers to “the ones perishing,” and the phrase **to the {others}** refers to “the ones being saved” (see [2:15](../02/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify to whom these phrases refer. Alternate translation: “to the latter … to the former” or “to the ones perishing … to the ones being saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:16	dwk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ὀσμὴ	-1	Here Paul continues to speak about **fragrance** and good smells (see [2:14–15](../02/14.md)). He specifically explains what kind of **aroma** he and his fellow workers are. Those who do not believe think that the **aroma** smells bad, while those who do believe think that the **aroma** smells good. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Make sure that your translation fits with how you translated the “smelling” language in [2:14–15](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: “we smell like an aroma … we smell like an aroma” or “our message is … our message is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:16	ud2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον & ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1	Twice here Paul uses the words **from** and **to** with the same word. He could be using this form because: (1) **from** indicates the source of the **aroma**, and **to** indicates the effects of the **aroma**. Alternate translation: “that smells like death and leads to death … that smells like life and leads to life” or “of death causing death … of life causing life” (2) **from** and **to** together emphasize that the **aroma** is characterized completely by either **death** or **life**. Alternate translation: “of death … of life” or “characterized completely by death … characterized completely by life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:16	yau5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ θανάτου εἰς θάνατον & ἐκ ζωῆς εἰς ζωήν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **death** and **life**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “die” and “live” or adjectives such as “dead” and “alive.” Make sure your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “that comes from something dying and that leads to people dying … that comes from something living and leads to people living” or “that smells like something dead … that smells like something alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:16	cdr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πρὸς ταῦτα	1	Here, the phrase **these things** refers back to what those who proclaim the good news must do, things that Paul has outlined in [2:14–16](../02/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to what **these things** refers. Alternate translation: “to do what I have said” or “to preach the gospel like this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:16	be6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πρὸς ταῦτα τίς ἱκανός?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question could imply that the answer is that: (1) Paul and his fellow workers are **sufficient** since God works through them. Alternate translation: “for these things, we are indeed sufficient!” (2) no one is **sufficient**. Alternate translation: “for these things, nobody is sufficient!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:17	h7y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) an explanation of the implied answer to the previous question, which is that Paul and his fellow workers are “sufficient” since God works through them. Alternate translation: “But we are sufficient, because” (2) an explanation of why Paul and his fellow workers are like an aroma of life or death (see [2:16](../02/16.md)). Alternate translation: “We are an aroma of life or death because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:17	pmpz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐσμεν & λαλοῦμεν	1	Here, just as in [2:14–15](../02/14.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach are … we speak” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I am … I speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
2:17	u7ui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ πολλοὶ	1	Paul is using the adjective **many** as a noun in order to refer **many** people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the many people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:17	yf8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	καπηλεύοντες	1	Here, the word **peddling** refers to the practice of selling goods that one has. The word implies that the person who is **peddling** is trying to make as much profit as they can, whether by honest or deceitful means. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to selling something for as much money as possible. Alternate translation: “trading in” or “selling off” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:17	a5sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, the word **word** represents what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the words” or “the communication” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:17	ohh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the word** that could be: (1) from **God**. Alternate translation: “the word from God” (2) about **God**. Alternate translation: “the word about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:17	u4iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’ ὡς	-1	Here Paul uses **but as** to introduce a contrast with **the many** who “peddle” God’s word. Paul repeats **but as** to continue and emphasize this contrast, not to contrast **sincerity** and **from God**. If the repetition of **but as** would be confusing, you could use **but as** once and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “but instead as … and even more as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:17	x86y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ εἰλικρινείας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sincerity**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sincere.” Alternate translation: “those who are sincere” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:17	f9x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς ἐκ Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **as from God** indicates that God sent Paul and his fellow workers to **speak** the gospel. The word **as** indicates how they **speak**. It does not mean that they are not really **from God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “as those whom God has sent” or “as ones sent by God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	aizg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λαλοῦμεν	1	Here, Paul implies that they are speaking **the word of God** that he already mentioned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what they **speak** more explicit. Alternate translation: “we speak the word of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	vpdc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατέναντι Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **in the presence of God** could indicate that: (1) they **speak** as they do because they know that **God** sees or knows what they do. So, they speak in a way that pleases **God**. Alternate translation: “as God desires” or “with God watching” (2) they **speak** with **God** as a witness guaranteeing what they say. Alternate translation: “with God as witness” or “with God guaranteeing it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	u2zb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains how they **speak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that they **speak** as those who are united to **Christ**. Alternate translation: “as Christians” or “as those united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:1	mdwx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀρχόμεθα & ἑαυτοὺς & μὴ χρῄζομεν	1	Here, just as in [2:14–15](../02/14.md), [17](../02/17.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “Are we who preach beginning … ourselves … we do not need … do we” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “Am I beginning … myself … I do not need … do I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:intro	f7rh				0	# 2 Corinthians 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Qualification for ministry (3:1–6)\n     * Ministry of Moses and ministry of Paul (3:7–4:6)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Letters of recommendation\n\nIn [3:1–3](../03/01.md), Paul refers to “letters of recommendation.” These were letters that a person carried with them when they traveled to a new place. Someone that the traveler knew would write that the traveler could be trusted and should be welcomed, and the traveler would give this letter to people that he or she visited. If something like this is not a common practice in your culture, you may need to explain it for your readers in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/letter]])\n\n### Letter and Spirit\n\nIn [3:6–8](../03/06.md), Paul contrasts “letter” and “Spirit.” In these verses, the word “letter” refers to written characters, and the word “Spirit” refers to the Holy Spirit. Paul’s point is that whatever is characterized by the “letter” is something that is only written down and does not have any power. Whatever is characterized by the “Spirit” has power and can change people. Although it also might be written down, the “Spirit” gives it power. Paul uses this contrast to describe one of the differences between the old covenant (“letter”) and the new covenant (“Spirit”). Consider a natural way to express this contrast in your language.\n\n### Glory\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul speaks extensively of “glory.” He indicates that the old covenant and ministry had glory, but the new covenant and ministry have much more glory. The word “glory” refers to how great, powerful, and amazing someone or something is. Consider how to express this idea throughout the chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])\n\n### Veiling of the glory on Moses’ face\n\nIn [3:7](../03/07.md), [13](../03/13.md), Paul refers to a story about what happened when Moses received the Ten Commandments from God. Because he met God and spoke with him, Moses’ face became bright or shining. Because of that, Moses would cover his face with a veil or cloth when he was with the Israelites after he spoke with God. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md). Paul also notes that the brightness or “glory” on Moses’ face would fade away. This detail cannot be found directly in the story in Exodus. Paul either inferred it from the story, or it was tradition to say that the “glory” faded away. If your readers would not understand what Paul refers to in these verses, you could include a footnote or explanatory information. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/veil]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The Corinthians as a letter of recommendation\n\nIn [3:2–3](../03/02.md), Paul describes the Corinthians themselves as a letter of recommendation for him and his fellow workers. He speaks in this way because anyone who knows the Corinthians will know that they believed because of Paul and those who worked with him. In this way, the Corinthians “recommend” Paul as a true apostle of Jesus. If possible, preserve the metaphor of a letter of recommendation or express the idea with a simile.\n\n### The “veil”\n\nAfter he introduces how Moses put an actual “veil” over his face, Paul begins to use the word “veil” and related words in figurative ways (see [3:14–18](../03/14.md)). He claims that people who are not united to Christ cannot understand the Old Testament, and he describes this inability to understand as a “veil” that covers their hearts. In other words, just as the the veil obscured the glory on Moses’ face, so the meaning of the Old Testament is obscured for someone who hears it but does not believe in Jesus. However,\nPaul says that this “veil” is taken away when someone believes in Jesus. Because of that, those who believe have no “veil” and can reflect God’s glory even more than Moses’ did. This is a complex figure of speech that connects directly to the story about Moses and his veil. Because of that, it is important to preserve the “veil” language. If your readers would not understand that Paul is speaking figuratively, you could use a simile to express the idea.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “The Lord is the Spirit”\n\nIn [3:17](../03/17.md), Paul states that “the Lord is the Spirit.” Scholars have understood this sentence in three primary ways. First, Paul could be defining who he meant when he referred to “the Lord” in the previous verse ([3:16](../03/16.md)). Second, Paul could be stating that the way that believers experience “the Lord” is as the Holy Spirit. Third, Paul could be stating that “the Lord” is a spirit or is spiritual. It is most likely true that Paul is defining who “the Lord” he has referred to is, so it is recommended that you follow the first option. See the notes on this verse for translation possibilities.
3:1	um8x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἀρχόμεθα πάλιν ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνειν?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “no, we are not.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “We are certainly not beginning to commend ourselves again!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:1	fuds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν	1	Here, the word **again** implies that Paul and his fellow workers had already “commended themselves” at some point in the past. Most likely, this happened when they first met the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this more explicit. Alternate translation: “once more” or “again, like we did at first” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:1	noiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἢ	1	The word **Or** introduces an alternative to what Paul asked in the first question. In that question, he implied that they were not “commending” themselves again. With **Or**, then, Paul poses a question that introduces the incorrect alternative: they might need **letters of recommendation**. He introduces this incorrect alternative to show that the implication of his first question is true: they are not “commending” themselves again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Or** with a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “Rather,” or “On the contrary,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:1	y8yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ μὴ χρῄζομεν, ὥς τινες, συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἢ ἐξ ὑμῶν?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “we do not need them.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “In fact, we certainly do not need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:1	syny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὥς τινες	1	Here, the word **some** refers generally to people other than Paul and his fellow workers. Paul may more specifically have in mind the people who opposed him in Corinth, but he does not make this explicit. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to people other than Paul and those who serve with him. Alternate translation: “like some others” or “like some people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:1	ad1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to refer to **letters** that gave a **recommendation** for the person who carry the letter. Many people in Paul’s culture would ask friends to write these letters, and then they would show the letters to people they visited to prove that they were trustworthy and could be welcomed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally refers to this kind of letter. Alternate translation: “letters of reference” or “letters of introduction” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:1	dygq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	συστατικῶν ἐπιστολῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **recommendation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “recommend.” Alternate translation: “letters that recommend us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:2	ty59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν ὑμεῖς ἐστε ἐνγεγραμμένη ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν, γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη ὑπὸ πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	Here Paul continues to speak about “letters,” but now he tells the Corinthians that they themselves are the **letter** of recommendation for Paul and his fellow workers. This **letter** is not a physical document, but is **written** in their **hearts**, and **all men** can **read** it. Paul speaks in this way to indicate that the recommendation he relies on is the Corinthian believers. In other words, the fact that they believe and that they are close with Paul (**in our hearts**) shows that Paul is trustworthy and a true apostle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “You yourselves are like our letter of recommendation, which you wrote on us and that is known and read by all men” or “We do not need a letter of recommendation because you yourselves are the recommendation that is in our hearts and that is known and understood by all men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:2	f8s8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ὑμεῖς ἐστε	1	Here, the word translated **yourselves** emphasizes **You**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **You** in your language. Alternate translation: “You indeed are” or “It is you who are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
3:2	a7xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν & ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	Here, just as in [3:1](../03/01.md), the word **our** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “the letter for us who preach the gospel … our hearts” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “my letter … my heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:2	ygx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἡμῶν & ἐνγεγραμμένη	1	With the phrase **our letter**, Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **letter** that could: (1) recommend “us.” Alternate translation: “the letter for us written” or “a letter that recommends us written” (2) be written by “us.” Alternate translation: “a letter written by us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:2	v2e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐνγεγραμμένη ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	In the Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. What Paul means is that the recommendation from the Corinthians is not written down on paper but, rather, is a part of their relationship with Paul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “written inside us” or “expressed by our relationship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:2	ko7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνγεγραμμένη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul states in the following verse that “Christ” did it (see [3:3](../03/03.md)). Alternate translation: “that Christ has written” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:2	bu1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη ὑπὸ πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which all men know and read” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:2	pzpz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	γινωσκομένη καὶ ἀναγινωσκομένη	1	Here, the words **known** and **read** express very similar ideas. It is likely that **known** indicates that people are aware that there is a **letter**, while **read** indicates that they know what the **letter** says. If you do not have words that express these distinctions, and if the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could express the idea with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “read” or “noticed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:2	dr5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the word **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to all people, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that applies to both men and women or you could refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “every person” or “all men and women” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:3	s717		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φανερούμενοι	1	Here, the phrase **making known** could: (1) indicate that something is well-known or obvious to people. Alternate translation: “being clear” or “so it is evident” (2) state that the Corinthians show or reveal something to others. Alternate translation: “you making it clear” or “you revealing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	aylw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐστὲ ἐπιστολὴ Χριστοῦ, διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν, ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ μέλανι, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ζῶντος, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶν λιθίναις, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλαξὶν καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1	Here Paul continues to speak as if the Corinthians were a **letter**. Here, he states that this **letter** was written by **Christ** and **administered** by Paul and his fellow workers. He means that **Christ** is the one who enabled the Corinthians to believe, and **Christ** worked through Paul and his fellow workers to do that. Paul then contrasts a **letter** written with **ink** and on **tablets of stone** with a **letter** written by the power of the **Spirit** and on **hearts of flesh**. What he means by this is that the letter is the Corinthians, not some written document, and that the message is communicated by the **Spirit**, not by letters written with **ink**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “you are like a letter of Christ having been administered by us, not written with ink but as if with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but as if on tablets of hearts of flesh” or “you are a message from Christ having been administered by us, not communicated by ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not presented on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:3	hlap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐπιστολὴ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **letter** is from or written by **Christ**.

3:3	wrk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that we have administered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:3	dsxa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διακονηθεῖσα ὑφ’ ἡμῶν	1	Here, the phrase **having been administered by us** could indicate that: (1) “we” delivered the **letter**. Alternate translation: “having been delivered by us” or “having been sent by us” (2) “we” helped **Christ** compose the **letter**. Alternate translation: “having been composed with our help” or “that we wrote down” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	bfsl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	Here, just as in [3:1–2](../03/01.md), the word **us** does not include the Corinthians.

Alternate translation: “me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:3	akc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ μέλανι, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ζῶντος, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶν λιθίναις, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλαξὶν καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1	If your language would not put the negative statements before the positive statements, you could reverse them. Alternate translation: “written with the Spirit of the living God, not with ink, on tablets of hearts of flesh, not on tablets of stone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:3	vyuh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ ζῶντος, οὐκ ἐν πλαξὶν λιθίναις, ἀλλ’ ἐν πλαξὶν καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1	These phrases leave out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the word **written** from earlier in the sentence in some or all of the phrases. Alternate translation: “but written with the Spirit of the living God, not written on tablets of stone but written on tablets of hearts of flesh” or “but with the Spirit of the living God, not written on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:3	q96q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνγεγραμμένη οὐ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that Christ did it. Alternate translation: “which Christ wrote not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:3	qt5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μέλανι	1	Here, the word **ink** refers to colored liquid that people in Paul’s culture used to write letters and words.

Alternate translation: “with a pen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:3	t5ah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Here, the phrase **living God** identifies God as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives life. The primary point is that **God** actually lives, unlike inanimate idols and other things that people may call gods. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really lives. Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	ana2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐν πλαξὶν	-1	Here, the word **tablets** refers to thin, flat pieces of stone on which people would write words, especially important words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the surface on which people write something important. Paul may be referring here to the **tablets** on which Moses wrote God’s commandments (see [Exodus 34:1–4](../exo/34/01.md)), so, if possible, use a word that could refer to those **tablets**. Alternate translation: “on flat pieces … on flat pieces” or “on plaques … on plaques” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:3	ih89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	πλαξὶν λιθίναις	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **tablets** that are made out of **stone**.

3:3	no25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καρδίαις σαρκίναις	1	In the Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. Here Paul states that these **hearts** are made of **flesh**, meaning that they are live, functional body parts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “of living people” or “of what we think and do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:4	pyev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development in the argument. Here it indicates that Paul is moving on to a slightly different topic. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces a development in the argument, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:4	wy6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἔχομεν	1	Here, just as in [3:1–3](../03/01.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians.

Alternate translation: “I have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:4	z7qx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πεποίθησιν & τοιαύτην ἔχομεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **confidence**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “confident.” Alternate translation: “we are confident in this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:4	q0kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πεποίθησιν & τοιαύτην	1	Here, the word **such** indicates that the **confidence** is the kind that Paul showed in the previous verses, especially in [3:1–3](../03/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that **such** refers back to what Paul has said in the previous verses. Alternate translation: “that kind of confidence” or “confidence in those ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:4	y72k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς τὸν Θεόν	1	Here, the phrase **toward God** could indicate that the **confidence** is: (1) before or in the presence of **God**. In other words, Paul has **confidence** that God approves of him and his fellow workers. Alternate translation: “with regard to God” (2) in **God**. In other words, Paul has **confidence** that God will do what he has promised. Alternate translation: “in God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:5	knf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐχ	1	Here, the word **Not** introduces a contrast with what Paul said in the previous verse about **confidence** (see [3:4](../03/04.md)). He wishes to clarify that the **confidence** is not based on human abilities but on **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “But it is not” or “However, it is not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:5	i7nt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἑαυτῶν & ἐσμεν & ἑαυτῶν & ἡμῶν	1	Here, just as in [3:1–4](../03/01.md), the words **we**, **ourselves**, and **our** do not include the Corinthians.

Alternate translation: “I am … myself … myself … my” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:5	qye9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν ἱκανοί & ἡ ἱκανότης ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul does not state what they are not **sufficient** to do. He implies that it is serving God by preaching the gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit.

3:5	e5e7			ἑαυτῶν & λογίσασθαί	1	Here, the phrase **to consider** introduces an explanation or elaboration of what **sufficient from ourselves** means.

3:5	tws9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τι	1	Here, the word **anything** refers to whatever they do to serve God well.

3:5	wi1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἱκανότης ἡμῶν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sufficiency**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sufficient.” Alternate translation: “God makes us sufficient” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:6	t785		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς διακόνους	1	Here, just as in [3:1–5](../03/01.md), the word **us** does not include the Corinthians. It could refer to: (1) Paul and those who proclaim the gospel with him. Alternate translation: “us, who preach the gospel, … as servants” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “me … as a servant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:6	r5ea		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	διακόνους καινῆς διαθήκης	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify himself and his fellow workers as **servants** who serve for the benefit of **a new covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as those who serve a new covenant” or “as servants who administer a new covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:6	j8rd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐ γράμματος, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματος	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the two clauses here. Alternate translation: “of the Spirit, not of the letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:6	poyq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ γράμματος, ἀλλὰ Πνεύματος	1	When Paul contrasts **letter** and **Spirit**, he implies that **letter** describes the old covenant and **Spirit** describes the new covenant. What he means is that the old covenant was only written down and could not change people on the inside. On the other hand, the new covenant is empowered by the Holy **Spirit**, who can change people on the inside. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this contrast more explicit. Alternate translation: “not a covenant of the letter that is powerless but a covenant of the powerful Spirit” or “not one that is only written down but one that the Spirit puts inside people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:6	dp6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	γράμματος & τὸ & γράμμα	1	Here, the word **letter** refers generally to a message written using sound-symbols called letters. More specifically, Paul uses the word **letter** to refer to the old covenant, a written document. It could not change people like the **Spirit** can.

3:6	q4at		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τὸ & γράμμα ἀποκτέννει	1	Here Paul speaks as if **the letter** were a person who **kills** others. He speaks in this way to indicate that **the letter** (which refers to the old covenant and its regulations) does not have the power to give life but instead can only condemn people to die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. Alternate translation: “the letter is like someone who kills” or “the letter dooms people to die” or “the letter causes death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:7	lyf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse.

3:7	yzhq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul is speaking as **if** the **glory** of the **ministry** of **death** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:7	rife		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **death**.

3:7	du65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1	Here, the word **ministry** could refer primarily to: (1) the action of ministering. In this case, the word refers to how Moses administered the old covenant. Alternate translation: “the service of this death” or “the act of ministering that led to death” (2) the system of **ministry**. In this case, the word refers to the old covenant or its laws. Alternate translation: “the system of this death” or “the laws that led to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	ut6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ διακονία τοῦ θανάτου	1	If your language does not use an abstract nouns for the idea of **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die.” Alternate translation: “the ministry that causes people die” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	j1hp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that God did it (see also [Exodus 34:1](../exo/34/01.md)). Alternate translation: “which God engraved in letters on stones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:7	rx13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν γράμμασιν ἐντετυπωμένη λίθοις	1	Here Paul refers to how God **engraved** or carved the regulations for the **ministry** on **stones** or tablets. Much as in the previous verse, **letters** refers to written characters, so the point is that God used writing. Paul is probably referring to the story about how Moses met God on a mountain, and God carved the regulations of the covenant on two pieces of stone. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:1–28](../exo/34/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “engraved in writing by God onto two stone slabs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	r5p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐγενήθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “was very great” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

When Moses returned to talk to the Israelites, his face shone brightly because he had been talking to God. In other words, some of God’s **glory** became part of Moses’ **face**, and the Israelites could not **look intently** at his face because it was a little like looking at God. You can read this story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit or include a footnote explaining the story. Alternate translation: “so that the sons of Israel were not able to look carefully at the face of Moses because of the fading glory on his face that came from talking with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	s9zp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς υἱοὺς	1	Although the word **sons** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any children or descendants, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that applies to both men and women or you could refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the sons and daughters” or “the children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:7	mh54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ	1	Here the author uses the word **sons** to refer in general to all the descendants of **Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to descendants in general. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “those descended from Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
3:7	enwt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1	Here, the reason why the Israelites **were not able to look intently** at Moses’ face could be that: (1) Moses’ face was very “glorious.” Alternate translation: “because of the glory of his face, even though it was fading” (2) the **glory of his face** was **fading**. Alternate translation: “because the glory of his face was fading” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	pqbi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “shining.” Alternate translation: “how his face was shining, even though that was fading” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	ewkr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν δόξαν τοῦ προσώπου αὐτοῦ, τὴν καταργουμένην	1	Here, the word **fading** could describe: (1) the **glory** of Moses’ **face**. Alternate translation: “the glory of his face that faded” (2) the **ministry of this death**.

3:8	xxn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς οὐχὶ μᾶλλον ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος ἔσται ἐν δόξῃ?	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “yes, it has much more glory.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “then the ministry of the Spirit will certainly be with much more glory.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:8	wkvl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	οὐχὶ & ἔσται	1	Here Paul could use the future tense because: (1) he is stating an inference from something in the past, so the inference is future. Paul does not mean that the **ministry** will only have **glory** in the future. Alternate translation: “then is … not” (2) he is stating that the **ministry** will have **glory** in the future. He could mean that it only has **glory** in the future, or he could mean that it has **glory** in the present and will also have **glory** in the future. Alternate translation: “will … in the future not be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
3:8	wq1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the ministry** that could: (1) lead to people receiving the **Spirit**.

3:8	dhs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ διακονία τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, the word **ministry** could refer primarily to: (1) the action of ministering. In this case, the word refers to how Paul and his fellow workers administered the new covenant. Alternate translation: “the service of the Spirit” or “the act of ministering that leads to the Spirit” (2) the system of **ministry**. In this case, the word refers to the new covenant or its principles. Alternate translation: “the system of the Spirit” or “the principles that lead to the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:8	bmme		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit.

3:8	tcp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μᾶλλον & ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “much more great” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:9	m2ci		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation of what Paul has said about the two ministries in [3:7–8](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “Even more,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:9	p7p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul is speaking as **if** the **glory** of the **ministry of this condemnation** were only a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:9	ufq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως & ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης	1	Here, the word **ministry** could refer primarily to: (1) the action of ministering. In this case, the word refers to how people administered the two covenants. Alternate translation: “the service of this condemnation … the service of this righteousness” or “the act of ministering that leads to this condemnation … the act of ministering that leads to this righteousness” (2) the system of **ministry**. In this case, the word refers to a covenant or its principles. Alternate translation: “the system of this condemnation … the system of this righteousness” or “the law that leads to condemnation … the principle that leads to righteousness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:9	k779		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **condemnation**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the ministry that caused this condemnation” or “the ministry that ended in this condemnation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:9	tcxw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ διακονίᾳ τῆς κατακρίσεως, δόξα	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **condemnation** and **glory**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the ministry that caused people to be condemned was great” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:9	if33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	πολλῷ μᾶλλον περισσεύει ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης δόξῃ	1	Here, Paul uses an exclamation to emphatically compare the two ministries and to show that **the ministry of this righteousness** has **much more glory**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a way that naturally compares the **glory** of the two ministries. Alternate translation: “then certainly the ministry of this righteousness abounds in much more glory!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
3:9	egmy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **ministry** that leads to **righteousness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way.

3:9	e5zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πολλῷ μᾶλλον περισσεύει ἡ διακονία τῆς δικαιοσύνης δόξῃ.	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **righteousness** and **glory**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “the ministry that makes people righteous is even more great” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	q8bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **For indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information that supports what he said about **glory** in [3:7–9](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “And in fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:10	n4pe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ δεδοξασμένον & τῆς ὑπερβαλλούσης δόξης	1	Here, the phrase **{what} had been glorified** refers to the old covenant that God gave through Moses. The phrase **surpassing glory** refers to the new covenant that Paul and his fellow workers serve. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what these phrases refer to more explicit. Alternate translation: “the old covenant that was glorified … the surpassing glory of the new covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:10	t2dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ δεδόξασται, τὸ δεδοξασμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If possible, avoid stating who does the “glorifying,” since Paul is focusing on the fact of “glory” rather than on the action of becoming “glorious.” Alternate translation: “what had glory does not have glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:10	hmcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐ δεδόξασται, τὸ δεδοξασμένον ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει	1	Here, the phrase **in this part** could modify: (1) in what way the old covenant is **not glorified**. In other words, **in this part** introduces the way in which something that has **been glorified** can actually be **not glorified**. Alternate translation: “what had been glorified is not glorified, and here is why:” or “what had been glorified is not glorified in this way” (2) **{what} had been glorified**. In other words, the old covenant was **glorified** only “partially.” Alternate translation: “what had been glorified in part is not glorified” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:10	es4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει	1	Here, the phrase **in this part** indicates that a statement is only true in **part** or in some specific way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the qualification that some statement or action is partially true or accurate. Alternate translation: “in a sense” or “in this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:10	d7k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν τούτῳ τῷ μέρει εἵνεκεν	1	Here, the phrase **in this part** and the word **because** both introduce how or why **{what} had been glorified** is **not glorified**. Paul uses both elements because he wants to make his point very clear. If the repetition would not make the point clearer, and if using both elements would be confusing in your language, you could use one word or phrase that introduces how what was **glorified** is **not glorified**. Alternate translation: “because of” or “in comparison to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:10	pvbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὑπερβαλλούσης δόξης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “what was much more glorious” or “what was even greater” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	f2mo			τῆς ὑπερβαλλούσης δόξης	1	Alternate translation: “the glory that surpasses it”
3:11	grwl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of the comparison between the two covenants and their **glory**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated.

3:11	r7c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul is speaking as if the **glory** of **{what} is fading away** were a possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word such as “since” or “given that.” Alternate translation: “since” or “given that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:11	ym37			τὸ καταργούμενον	1	Here, the words translated **{what} is fading away** could indicate: (1) that something is disappearing or temporary without stating that anyone is making it disappear. Alternate translation: “what is passing away” (2) that God is causing something to disappear or pass away. Alternate translation: “what is being abolished” or “what God is abolishing”
3:11	zwb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ καταργούμενον	1	Here, the phrase **fading away** translates the same word that Paul used in [3:7](../03/07.md) to refer to how the glory was “fading” from Moses’ face. Paul means that just like the glory on Moses’ face was temporary, so the old covenant that God made through Moses was also temporary. See how you translated this idea in [3:7](../03/07.md) and use similar language if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea using a simile. Alternate translation: “what is temporary” or “what is fading, like the glory on Moses’ face,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:11	hm9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ καταργούμενον & τὸ μένον	1	Here, the phrase **{what} is fading away** refers to the old covenant, while the phrase **{what} remains** refers to the new covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what these phrases refer to. Alternate translation: “the old covenant that is fading away … the new covenant that remains” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:11	wtht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ δόξης & ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great” or an adverb such as “gloriously.” Alternate translation: “was great … is great” or “came gloriously … will come gloriously” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:11	wrf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	πολλῷ μᾶλλον τὸ μένον ἐν δόξῃ	1	Here, Paul uses an exclamation to emphatically compare the two covenants and to show that the covenant that **remains** has much more **glory**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a way that naturally compares the **glory** of the two covenants. Alternate translation: “then certainly what remains will come with much more glory!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
3:12	tnc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference from what Paul has already said, especially what he has said about the ministry of “glory” in [3:4–11](../03/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference from a previous section. Alternate translation: “Because of that” or “Because of this ministry of glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:12	ib35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1	Here, the word **having** introduces a reason why Paul and his fellow workers **act with much boldness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “because we have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:12	j76k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔχοντες & τοιαύτην ἐλπίδα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “hope” or an adjective such as “hopeful.” Alternate translation: “being hopeful in such a way” or “hoping in that way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:12	u5qa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοιαύτην ἐλπίδα	1	Here, the word **such** refers to back to what Paul has said about the “glory” of the ministry in [3:7–11](../03/07.md). In other words, the **hope** is based on the glorious ministry and covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what **such** refers to. Alternate translation: “that kind of hope” or “hope in such a covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:12	rf9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	χρώμεθα	1	Here, just as in [3:1–6](../03/01.md), the word **we** does not include the Corinthians.

Alternate translation: “I act” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:12	zbff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χρώμεθα	1	Here Paul does not say exactly what it is that **we** do. He implies that it is the “ministry” that he has referred to in [3:7–11](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **we** do more explicit. Alternate translation: “we perform the ministry” or “we proclaim the good news” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:12	b5ql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πολλῇ παρρησίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **boldness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “bold” or an adverb such as “boldly.” Alternate translation: “as very bold people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:13	fb59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ οὐ καθάπερ Μωϋσῆς	1	Here Paul contrasts the **boldness** that he and his fellow workers show with how **Moses** could not show God’s glory openly. In other words, Paul and his fellow workers can reveal God’s glory openly, in contrast to Moses, who could not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this contrast more explicit. Alternate translation: “and without hiding the glory, like Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	p1y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Μωϋσῆς ἐτίθει κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἀτενίσαι τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ, εἰς τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	Here Paul refers to a story in [Exodus 34:29–35](../exo/34/29.md) that describes how Moses’ face shone with God’s glory after Moses spoke with him. Moses would hide his face with a **veil** when **his face** shone like this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what Paul is writing about more explicit. See how you translated the similar phrases in [3:7](../03/07.md), where Paul has already referred to this story. Alternate translation: “Moses wearing a veil to hide his face so that the sons of Israel would not look directly at it when the glory on his face, which came from talking with God, was disappearing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	boui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς υἱοὺς	1	Although the word **sons** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any children or descendants, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that applies to both men and women or you could refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “the sons and daughters” or “the children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:13	pdnk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραὴλ	1	Here the author uses the word **sons** to refer in general to all the descendants of **Israel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to descendants in general. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel” or “those descended from Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
3:13	vuyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1	Here, the word **end** could refer to: (1) the result of the **fading**, which was that the “glory” completely stopped shining from Moses’ face. Alternate translation: “the cessation” or “the termination” (2) the purpose or implication of how the “glory” ceased shining from Moses’ face, which was that the old covenant too would cease. Alternate translation: “the result” or “the meaning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	p5u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	Here, the phrase **{what} was fading away** could refer to: (1) the “glory” that shone from the **face** of Moses. In this case, Paul could also be implying that the old covenant would also “fade.” Alternate translation: “of the glory that was fading from his face” (2) the old covenant, that would “fade away” when God instituted a new covenant. Alternate translation: “of the covenant that would fade away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	mczg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ τέλος τοῦ καταργουμένου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe how **{what} was fading away** completely ceased or “ended.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how what was fading away ended” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:14	kb8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **But** could introduce a contrast between: (1) being able to “look intently” and having **hardened** minds. Alternate translation: “But instead of looking intently,” (2) what Moses did (veiling his face) and what the Israelites did (have **hardened** minds). Alternate translation: “In contrast to Moses,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:14	csl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **their** refers to “the sons of Israel” that Paul mentioned in [3:13](../03/13.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to whom the pronoun **their** refers. Alternate translation: “the minds of the sons of Israel” or “the minds of the Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:14	khkq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπωρώθη τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If it is possible, avoid stating who did the “hardening,” since Paul is emphasizing the fact that their minds were “hard,” not who did the “hardening.” If you must state who did the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) the Israelites did it to themselves. Alternate translation: “they hardened their minds” or “their minds became hard” (2) God did it to them. Alternate translation: “God hardened their minds” (3) Satan did it to them. Alternate translation: “Satan hardened their minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:14	zvf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπωρώθη τὰ νοήματα αὐτῶν	1	Here Paul speaks as if people’s **minds** were a soft substance that could be **hardened**, becoming resistant to change. He speaks in this way to indicate that their **minds** could not know or understand what was happening, unlike a soft substance that would change when something impacts it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “they could not realize what was true” or “they could not think properly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	tzbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces a further explanation of what Paul has said about how **their minds were hardened**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “since” or “because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:14	w68p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναγνώσει τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης μένει, μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1	Here Paul speaks as if a **veil** kept people from understanding the **old covenant** when it is “read,” and this veil is not **lifted**. He speaks in this way to identify the inability of people to understand the **old covenant** with how Moses’ kept the Israelites from looking at his face with a **veil**. Just as the **veil** kept them from seeing the glory on his face, so a **veil** keeps people from understanding **the reading of the old covenant**. Since Paul uses this figure of speech to connect what he is saying with what he has said about Moses, you should preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “their lack of understanding is a like a veil that remains at the reading of the old covenant, not being lifted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	wcbv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναγνώσει τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης μένει, μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1	Here, the phrase **not being lifted** could: (1) explain why the veil **remains**. Alternate translation: “the same veil remains at the reading of the old covenant, since it is not lifted” (2) describe the state that **remains**. Alternate translation: “the same veil is still not lifted at the reading of the old covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:14	wymg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ αὐτὸ κάλυμμα	1	Here, the phrase **same veil** could refer to: (1) the veil that Moses wore (see [3:13](../03/13.md)). Alternate translation: “the veil that Moses wore” (2) the veil that **hardened** their **minds**. Alternate translation: “the veil that hardened their minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:14	gg2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναγνώσει τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to refer to a person **reading** the **old covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when the old covenant is read” or “when they read the old covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:14	orvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῆς παλαιᾶς διαθήκης	1	Here, the phrase **old covenant** refers to the words that contain or describe **the old covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer directly to these words. Alternate translation: “of the message about the old covenant” or “of the words that describe the old covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:14	gl8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ ἀνακαλυπτόμενον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who would do the action, Paul implies that “God” would do it. Alternate translation: “God not lifting it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:14	vygf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **because** could indicate why: (1) the **veil** is not “lifted.” Alternate translation: “and it is not lifted, because” (2) the **veil remains**. Alternate translation: “and the veil remains, because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:14	m7lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains why and how the **veil** is “lifted.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that being united to Christ leads to the “lifting” of the **veil**. Alternate translation: “only when a person is united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	r1lt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καταργεῖται	1	Here, the phrase **fading away** is the same phrase that Paul used to describe how the “glory” was “fading” from Moses’ face (see [3:13](../03/13.md)). What Paul means is that the **veil** disappears or is removed **in Christ**. If possible, use a word or phrase that reminds your readers of how you translated “fading” in [3:13](../03/13.md). Alternate translation: “is it being abolished” or “is it disappearing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:14	rhid		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καταργεῖται	1	Here, the word **it** could refer to: (1) the **veil**. Alternate translation: “is this veil fading away” (2) the **old covenant**. Alternate translation: “is this covenant fading away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:15	cv2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with what Paul said in the previous verse about the veil “fading away” in Christ ([3:14](../03/14.md)). What Paul says in the rest of the verse repeats many of the ideas from the first parts of [3:14](../03/14.md). Consider whether a contrast word or a connecting word expresses the idea most clearly. Alternate translation: “However,” or “In fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:15	t3dl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀναγινώσκηται Μωϋσῆς	1	Here, the word **Moses** could refer to: (1) the first five books of the Old Testament, often called “the Law” or the “Pentateuch.” Alternate translation: “the Law is read” or “the first parts of the Old Testament are read” (2) the entire Old Testament. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures are read” or “the Old Testament is read” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:15	ip29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναγινώσκηται Μωϋσῆς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone reads Moses” or “they hear someone read Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:15	bb5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κάλυμμα ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν κεῖται	1	Here Paul continues to refer to a **veil** that keeps people from understanding the Scriptures. Express the metaphor as you did in [3:14](../03/14.md). Alternate translation: “their lack of understanding is like a veil that lies over their heart” or “they do not understand, as if a veil lies over their heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:15	gwp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “over their mind” or “over their understanding” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:15	z5zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **heart** is a singular noun that refers to the “hearts” of many people. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. Alternate translation: “their hearts” or “each of their hearts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
3:15	lmu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τὴν καρδίαν αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **their** could refer to: (1) anyone who hears the reading of **Moses** without being “in Christ.” Alternate translation: “the hearts of those who listen” (2) the same people that “their” referred to in [3:14](../03/14.md): the Israelites. Alternate translation: “the Israelites’ heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:16	k2dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς Κύριον	1	Here, the phrase **turn to the Lord** refers to a how people stop doing whatever they want and instead begin to trust and obey God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “one begins to serve the Lord” or “one begins to believe in the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:16	aqna		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπιστρέψῃ	1	Here, the word **one** refers to any person who does the “turning.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to any person.

Express the metaphor as you did in [3:14–15](../03/14.md). Alternate translation: “the lack of understanding that is like a veil is taken away” or “one understands, as if the veil were taken away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:16	w1y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	περιαιρεῖται τὸ κάλυμμα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that God does it. Alternate translation: “the veil disappears” or “God takes away the veil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:17	lrxy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse.

3:17	erpi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ Πνεῦμά & τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit.

3:17	f2o7			ὁ & Κύριος τὸ Πνεῦμά ἐστιν	1	Here Paul could mean that: (1) the “Lord” mentioned in [3:16](../03/16.md) is the Holy **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord of whom I speak is the Holy Spirit” (2) believers encounter God the **Lord** as the Holy **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord is experienced as the Holy Spirit” (3) the **Lord** is “spiritual.” Alternate translation: “the Lord is a spirit”
3:17	sp81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὗ & τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου, ἐλευθερία	1	Here Paul speaks of the **Spirit** being in a place, and so **freedom** also is in that place. Here he speaks in this way to connect the **Spirit** and **freedom**. He means that whoever has the **Spirit** also has **freedom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “whoever has the Spirit of the Lord also has freedom” or “the Spirit of the Lord gives freedom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:17	b016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **the Spirit** as belonging to or part of the **Lord**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the Spirit, who is the Lord, is” or “the Spirit, who belongs to the Lord, is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:17	uoss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐλευθερία	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **freedom**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “free.” Alternate translation: “people are free” or “you are free” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:17	ao12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλευθερία	1	Here Paul does not give any details about from or for what people experience **freedom**. If possible, you also should not make these ideas explicit. However, if you must express more information about the **freedom**, it could be **freedom** (1) from the veil.

3:18	r6rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous section. In this case, Paul is concluding his discussion about Moses and the veil in [3:12–17](../03/12.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a final development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In the end,” or “Finally,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:18	l3xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνακεκαλυμμένῳ προσώπῳ, τὴν δόξαν Κυρίου κατοπτριζόμενοι	1	Here the author speaks as if believers do not have a veil over their faces and can thus reflect God’s **glory**. Since the veiling language is an important part of what Paul is saying, you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea by using a simile. Paul is indicating a contrast that could be: (1) with Moses, who had to veil the glory on his face. Unlike him, believers do not need to veil their faces. Alternate translation: “revealing the glory of the Lord like those who have unveiled faces” (2) the Israelites, who could not look directly at the glory of God. Unlike them, believers can see God’s glory directly without a veil. Alternate translation: “seeing the glory of the Lord, unlike those who could only see a veil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:18	ui8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατοπτριζόμενοι	1	Here, the word translated **reflecting** could refer to: (1) acting as a mirror that “reflects” an image.

3:18	brpu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Κυρίου	1	Here, just as in [3:16–17](../03/16.md), the word **Lord** could refer to God generally or to Jesus specifically.

3:18	rc9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μεταμορφούμεθα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that God does it. Alternate translation: “are those whom God is transforming into” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:18	cq3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα	1	Here, the phrase **the same image** refers to the **image** that belongs to the **Lord**.

3:18	g0ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν αὐτὴν εἰκόνα & ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **image** and **glory**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reflect” and an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “people who reflect the Lord from what is glorious to what is glorious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:18	bx5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ δόξης εἰς δόξαν	1	Here Paul uses the words **from** and **to** with the same word, much as he did in [2:16](../02/16.md). He could be using this form because: (1) **from** indicates the source of the transformation, and **to** indicates the effects of the transformation. Alternate translation: “by someone who has glory so that we also have glory” (2) **from** and **to** together emphasize that the transformation is characterized completely by **glory**. Alternate translation: “with great glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:18	mw3v			καθάπερ ἀπὸ	1	Here, the phrase **just as from** indicates the source of the transformation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and this is from” or “even as it is accomplished by”
3:18	wlp1			Κυρίου, Πνεύματος	1	Here, Paul could be using this phrase to: (1) identify the **Lord** as the **Spirit**, as he did in [3:17](../03/17.md). Just as in that verse, he could mean that the **Lord** is the **Spirit**, or he could mean that the **Lord** is experienced as the **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord, that is, the Spirit” or “the Lord, whom we experience as the Spirit” (2) name the Holy Spirit as “the Spirit of the Lord,” as he did in [3:17](../03/17.md). Alternate translation: “the Spirit of the Lord” (3) refer to the **Lord** to whom the **Spirit** belongs or who sends the **Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Lord of the Spirit”
3:18	mmdd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Πνεύματος	1	Here, the word **Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit” (2) what is “spiritual” as opposed to what is written or fleshly. Alternate translation: “who is spiritual” or “who is a spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:intro	rx1c				0	# 2 Corinthians 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Ministry of Moses and ministry of Paul (3:7–4:6)\n     * Suffering and ministry (4:7–18)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Life and death\n\nIn [4:7–14](../04/07.md), Paul refers to life, death, and resurrection. When he refers to how he and his fellow workers experience death or dying, he is referring to how they suffer and experience things related to death. When he refers to how he and his fellow workers experience life or being raised, he is most likely referring to how God will resurrect them. He could also be referring to how God delivers them from death when they suffer or are persecuted. Consider what forms you could use to refer to experiences related to death and resurrection. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nIn [4:3–6](../04/03.md), Paul describes a lack of understanding and belief in the gospel as veiling, blinding, and darkness. He describes understanding and belief in the gospel as shining and light. These figures of speech compare believing and understanding to seeing. If possible, preserve these figures of speech, but you could express the ideas in plain language if necessary. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/light]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/darkness]])\n\n### “Outer” and “inner” man\n\nIn [4:16](../04/16.md), Paul refers to two different parts of himself and his fellow workers: their inner man and their outer man. The “inner” and the “outer” are probably not directly related to the spiritual and physical parts of people. Rather, the inner is connected to what is not seen, and the outer is connected to what is seen (see [4:18](../04/18.md)). Consider what form you can use to refer to the parts of a person that people can observe and the parts of a person that they cannot observe. Make sure that your translation does not simply distinguish between the skin and what is under the skin. It is more important to use words that suggest that what people observe is not always what is really true about a person.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses these words, he does not include the Corinthians unless a note specifies otherwise. He could be referring to: (1) himself and those who preach the gospel with him. (2) just himself. It is recommended that you follow the first option, but both are possible. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### The contrasts in [4:8–12](../04/08.md).\n\nIn these verses, Paul contrasts bad things that happen to him and those with him with good things that happen to them. Paul wrote these verses as one long sentence with short clauses because this was a powerful form in his culture. Consider using a form that is powerful in your culture. The UST expresses the idea with many short sentences because this is one kind of powerful form in English.
4:1	lyi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion based on what Paul has said, particularly what he said in [3:4–18](../03/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion based on what has been said. Alternate translation: “So then” or “Because of that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:1	ln4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1	Here, the word **having** introduces a reason why Paul and his fellow workers **do not become discouraged**.

4:1	h1ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθὼς ἠλεήθημεν	1	Here, this phrase could indicate: (1) the way that Paul and his fellow workers received the **ministry**. Alternate translation: “which we received by God’s mercy” (2) what led to Paul and his fellow workers receiving the ministry, which was their conversions. Alternate translation: “which we received after God had mercy on us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:1	que0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἠλεήθημεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **mercy**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “merciful” or an adverb such as “mercifully.” Alternate translation: “God acted mercifully toward us” or “God was merciful to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:1	ix7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐνκακοῦμεν	1	Here, the word **discouraged** could refer to: (1) losing motivation and confidence.

4:2	yp4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **Instead** introduces a contrast with “becoming discouraged” in the previous verse ([4:1](../04/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “Instead of that” or “On the other hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:2	z4c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ κρυπτὰ τῆς αἰσχύνης	1	Here, the phrase **shameful hidden things** could refer to: (1) things that people “hide” because they are **shameful**. Alternate translation: “the shameful things that people hide” (2) things that are both **hidden** and **shameful**. Alternate translation: “anything that is shameful and hidden” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	ey75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ περιπατοῦντες	1	Paul speaks of behavior in life as if people were **walking in** something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “not acting” or “not behaving” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:2	vvzc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πανουργίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **craftiness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “crafty” or an adverb such as “craftily.” Alternate translation: “craftily” or “in a crafty way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:2	gcqm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **word** that comes from **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the word that comes from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:2	gp3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, the word **word** represents what someone says in words.

4:2	mrri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ φανερώσει τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **manifestation** that reveals **the truth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “by revealing the truth” or “by making the truth known” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:2	e7y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ φανερώσει τῆς ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **manifestation** and **truth**, you could express the ideas by using a verb such as “reveal” and an adjective such as “true.” Alternate translation: “by revealing what is true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:2	aj24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the word **man’s** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any person, either man or woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that applies to both men and women or you could refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “person’s” or “to man’s and woman’s” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:2	f6n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul refers to being **before God** to indicate a close connection to God. The phrase could indicate that: (1) God testifies or bears witness to Paul and his fellow workers. Alternate translation: “with God testifying about us” (2) people can recognize that Paul preaches the gospel only when they are **before God** or in God’s presence. Alternate translation: “that is in God’s presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	lu2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a development from what Paul said in the previous verse ([4:2](../04/02.md)). In this verse, he explains that, although they reveal “the truth,” it may be **veiled** to some people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of development. Alternate translation: “Now” or “However,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:3	m82q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & καὶ	1	Here Paul could be using **even if** to introduce: (1) something that he thinks really is true. Alternate translation: “even though” (2) something that he thinks might be true. Alternate translation: “supposing that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
4:3	mti5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔστιν κεκαλυμμένον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν, ἐν τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις ἐστὶν κεκαλυμμένον	1	Here Paul again uses the language of “veiling,” just as he did in [3:12–18](../03/12.md). A **gospel** that **is veiled** is one that people do not understand or believe in. If possible, express the idea the same way you did in [3:12–18](../03/12.md). Alternate translation: “it is as though a veil hides our gospel, this happens to the ones perishing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	hz2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰ & ἔστιν κεκαλυμμένον τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν, ἐν & ἐστὶν κεκαλυμμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If possible, avoid stating who does the veiling and instead refer to how a veil hides the **gospel**. Alternate translation: “if a veil covers our gospel, this happens for” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:3	e5yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τοῖς ἀπολλυμένοις	1	Christians disagree over whether God causes people to perish or whether people cause themselves to perish. The word that Paul uses here intentionally does not include the person who causes the perishing. If possible, your translation also should avoid stating who causes the perishing. See how you translated the similar phrase in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: “the ones on the path to destruction” or “the ones who are not being saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:4	m71d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	Here, the phrase **the god of this age** refers to Satan, or the devil. Paul describes him in this way because God has allowed Satan to have some control or power in **this age**, which refers to the world as it is right now. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the god of this age, Satan,” or “the devil, who rules over this age” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:4	ptb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ θεὸς τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **god** who rules over or controls **this age**.

4:4	r6pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐτύφλωσεν τὰ νοήματα τῶν ἀπίστων, εἰς τὸ μὴ αὐγάσαι τὸν φωτισμὸν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου τῆς δόξης τοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **minds** were eyes that could be **blinded** or that could see **light**. If **minds** are **blinded**, they cannot understand something. If **minds** can see **light**, they can understand something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “has made the minds of the unbelievers to be like blind eyes, so that they do not understand the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:4	squ9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀπίστων, εἰς τὸ	1	Here, the phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) the result of **the god of this age** blinding people’s minds.

Alternate translation: “of the unbelievers, in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:4	j1vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν φωτισμὸν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου τῆς δόξης τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here the author uses the possessive form multiple times. What he means is that the **light** either is or comes from the **gospel**, and the **gospel** is about the **glory of Christ**. In this last phrase, **glory** describes what **Christ** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural form. Alternate translation: “the light, which is the gospel about the glorious Christ” or “the light that comes from the gospel concerning how glorious Christ is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:4	hj21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς δόξης τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “of the great Christ” or “Christ, the glorious one,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:4	fmaq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **image**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “reflect” or “represent.” Alternate translation: “who reflects God” or “who represents God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:4	tx9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe how **Christ** functions as the **image** that shows what **God** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way.

Alternate translation: “That is true because we are not watching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:18	fp4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ σκοπούντων	1	Here, the word **watching** refers specifically to focusing on something or paying close attention to something.

Alternate translation: “are not focusing on” or “are not concentrating on” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:18	t2fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ βλεπόμενα, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὴ βλεπόμενα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

5:intro	s14p				0	# 2 Corinthians 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Confidence in the resurrection (5:1–10)\n     * The gospel (5:11–6:2)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrection bodies\n\nIn [5:1–5](../05/01.md), Paul speaks about new bodies that believers will receive when Jesus comes back. Right now, he and his fellow workers groan while they have their current bodies. That is because these bodies are weak and will eventually die. However, Paul and his fellow workers do not want to just get rid of their bodies. Rather, they are looking forward expectantly to receiving new bodies that will not die. Paul expresses these ideas by using building and clothing language. See the sections below that address how this language functions. Make sure that your translation clearly contrasts old bodies with new bodies and does not suggest that Paul just wants to get rid of his body.\n\n### The intermediate state?\n\nIn [5:6–9](../05/06.md), Paul speaks about being away from the body and with the Lord. As the previous section has illustrated, Paul’s goal is to have a new body, not to be “away from the body.” So, what is he referring to here? There are three primary options. First, many Christians believe that Paul is talking about the time period between when a believer dies and when Jesus comes back. During this time period, the believer does not have a body but is with Jesus in heaven. Then, when Jesus comes back, the believer receives a new body. Second, some Christians believe that Paul is talking about how believers receive new bodies immediately after they die. In other words, the next thing that a believer experiences after he or she dies is Jesus’ return. In this case, there is no time period between death and resurrection. Third, some Christians believe that Paul is speaking about how believers receive a temporary body for the time they are in heaven with Jesus before he comes back. If possible, your translation should allow for all three of these interpretations. Make sure that you include at least option one, since this is the option that most Christians believe.\n\n### New creation\n\nIn [5:17](../05/17.md), Paul speaks about how being “in Christ” leads to “new creation,” with “old things” passing away and “new things” coming. Paul uses very general language, and the “new creation” could identify the person who is “in Christ” or everything that God is making “new.” If it is about people primarily, Paul’s point is that they are made “new” when they are in Christ. If it is about the world in general, Paul’s point is that God makes the world “new” in Christ, and people experience this “new creation” when they too are in Christ. Since Paul’s language is so general, it is best to express the idea in such a way that both of these interpretations are possible. If you must choose one, most interpreters think that Paul is focusing on people here. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/creation]])\n\n### Reconciliation\n\nIn [5:18–20](../05/18.md), Paul speaks about how God reconciles people to himself and gives the ministry of reconciliation to Paul and his fellow workers. The word “reconcile” refers to how someone restores a relationship with someone else so that they can be together again. In other words, when someone does something that breaks or hurts a relationship, “reconciliation” heals the broken relationship. Consider how you might naturally express this idea in your language. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/reconcile]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Bodies as homes\n\nIn [5:1–9](../05/01.md), Paul speaks about bodies as if they were homes. He identifies current earthly bodies as “tents,” which indicates that they do not last. He identifies resurrection bodies as “buildings” that God makes. Paul uses the language of “home” to indicate that people belong in bodies and not without bodies. However, he does seem to think that people can be without bodies for a period of time, just as people can leave their homes for a period of time (see the above discussion of the “intermediate state”). Further, he contrasts “tent” homes with “building” homes to indicate that the “building” is the home (that is, body) that will last forever and which believers should long for. If possible, preserve the “home” language in your translation, either in metaphor or simile form. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/house]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tent]])\n\n### Bodies as clothing\n\nIn [5:2–4](../05/02.md), Paul mixes “clothing” language in with his “home” language. The clothes are bodies, and Paul again uses this language to indicate that people belong in bodies (clothed), not without bodies (naked or unclothed). He does not use clothing language to show that bodies are an unimportant part of who people are. If possible, preserve the clothing language in your translation, either in metaphor or simile form. However, if how Paul mixes together home and clothing language would be confusing, you may need to use only the home language and express the clothing language plainly or as home language. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/clothed]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses this form, he is focusing on himself and his fellow workers, or just on himself (although this is less likely). However, he does not necessarily mean that what he says is not true of the Corinthians or of believers in general. Consider how you can communicate the focus on Paul and his fellow workers without totally excluding the Corinthians. In every case where Paul may be using the first person plural in a way different than this, a note will explain the options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Singular nouns in general statements\n\nIn [5:1–10](../05/01.md), Paul consistently refers to “body,” “building,” “tent,” and “home” in singular form. He does this because the singular form was a natural way to refer to these things in general. Throughout this section, the UST models how to express the ideas in plural form, since this is more natural for general statements in English. Consider how your language might naturally express a general statement about “bodies.”\n\n### Translating [5:21](../05/21.md)\n\nPaul speaks in a very compressed way in this verse, and Christians disagree about what exactly he means. What is relatively clear is that Paul has in mind what some people call an “exchange” between Christ and believers. Christ, who is “righteous,” is somehow identified with “sin,” and believers, who are “sinners,” are somehow identified with “righteousness.” The “in him” at the end of the verse indicates that this interchange occurs in union with Christ. For details about what it could mean for Christ to be “made sin” and for believers to “become the righteousness of God,” see the notes on this verse. If possible, however, your translation should be as general as Paul’s sentence. This means that you should express the general idea of “exchange” and allow for many of the possible interpretations listed in the notes.
5:1	p7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) an explanation of what Paul said in [4:18](../04/18.md). Alternate translation: “In fact,” (2) an example or illustration of what Paul said in [4:18](../04/18.md). Alternate translation: “For example,” (3) a basis for what Paul said in [4:18](../04/18.md). Alternate translation: “That is because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:1	v03z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν & ἡμῶν & ἔχομεν	1	Here and throughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. See the chapter introduction for more information on how to translate these words. Here, the words **we** and **our** could refer to: (1) just Paul and his fellow workers. Paul is focusing on himself and his fellow workers, but he does not mean to exclude the Corinthians entirely. Alternate translation: “we who preach the gospel … our … we have” (2) Paul and everyone who believes, including the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “all of us know … our … we have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:1	la71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν	1	Here, the word **if** could introduce: (1) something that Paul thinks will definitely happen, but he is not sure when. Alternate translation: “whenever” (2) something that Paul thinks might happen. Alternate translation: “even if” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:1	z4vs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ, οἰκοδομὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ ἔχομεν, οἰκίαν ἀχειροποίητον αἰώνιον ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Here Paul speaks as if a person’s body were a **house**, **tent**, or **building** in which that the person lives. This was a common way to refer to a person’s body in Paul’s culture. He identifies the current body as a **tent** that is **torn down**, because this body will die. He describes the body that a person will have when God resurrects them as a **building from God** and an **eternal house** that is **not made with hands**. This is an important metaphor in [5:1–9](../05/01.md), so preserve the **house**, **tent**, and **building** language if possible. If it would be helpful, you could use a simile or identify the **house** in another natural way. Alternate translation: “our earthly house of this tent, that is, our mortal body, is torn down, we have a building from God, that is, our resurrection body, an eternal house in the heavens, not made with hands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:1	zy2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone tears down our earthly house of this tent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:1	bvz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους	1	Here, Paul uses the possessive form identify the **earthly house** as a **tent**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form. Alternate translation: “our earthly house, which is a tent,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:1	gz3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ἡ ἐπίγειος ἡμῶν οἰκία τοῦ σκήνους καταλυθῇ, οἰκοδομὴν & οἰκίαν & αἰώνιον	1	Here and throughout [5:1–8](../05/01.md), Paul uses the singular form to refer to “bodies” in general, sometimes described as buildings or clothing. See the chapter introduction for more information. Consider what would be natural in your language and use that form throughout these verses. Alternate translation: “our earthly houses of these tents are torn down … buildings … eternal houses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
5:1	xifl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Many people in Paul’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. Here Paul refers to how the **eternal house** can be found **in the heavens**. Since Paul does not include details about the heavens, translate **heavens** with a word or phrase that refers to all of heavenly space, including the idea of multiple heavens if possible. Alternate translation: “in the heavenly realm” or “in the heavenly spaces” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:1	bqi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἀχειροποίητον	1	Here, the word **hands** refers to the main part of the body that we use to make things. So, the phrase refers to the whole person who makes things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **hands** refers to “humans” in general, not just their hands. Alternate translation: “not made by humans” or “not made by people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
5:1	bbvr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀχειροποίητον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which hands did not make” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:2	mt4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **For indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous verse (**For**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Further” or “And in fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:2	tc2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν τούτῳ	1	Here, the phrase **in this** could refer to: (1) the earthly house that is a tent, that is, the person’s current body. Alternate translation: “in this tent” or “in our bodies on earth” (2) the current time period. Alternate translation: “right now” or “in this time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:2	yg6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐν τούτῳ στενάζομεν, τὸ οἰκητήριον ἡμῶν τὸ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐπενδύσασθαι ἐπιποθοῦντες	1	Here Paul continues to refer to mortal bodies and resurrection bodies as “houses” or “dwellings.” You should express the idea as you did in [5:1](../05/01.md). Paul also begins to refer to receiving new, resurrection bodies as if they were pieces of clothing that people could put on. This also is an important figure of speech for the following verses, so preserve the language if possible. If it is necessary, you could use a simile or express the idea in another natural way that fits with the “building” language. Alternate translation: “in this house, that is, our mortal body, we groan, longing to completely live in our dwelling that is from heaven, that is, our resurrection body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:2	ss6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who will do the action, Paul implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to fully clothe us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:3	bjau		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐνδυσάμενοι, οὐ γυμνοὶ εὑρεθησόμεθα	1	Here Paul continues to speak of bodies as if they were clothing. You should express the idea as you did in [5:2](../05/02.md). Alternate translation: “we have a house to live in, we will not be found homeless” or “having a new body that is like clothing, we will not be found naked, that is, without a body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:3	da0z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ γε & ἐνδυσάμενοι	1	Here Paul is speaking as if **having clothed ourselves** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it will actually be true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “when” or “whenever.” Alternate translation: “when indeed we have clothed ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:3	i4es			ἐνδυσάμενοι	1	Here Paul could mean that: (1) **we** clothe **ourselves**. Alternate translation: “we clothe ourselves” (2) God clothes “us.” Alternate translation: “God clothes us”
5:3	ap7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ & εὑρεθησόμεθα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form to focus on the state of being **naked** rather than on who “finds” them, so you should avoid stating a subject for **found**. Alternate translation: “we will not be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	zvz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **For indeed** indicates that Paul is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports what he said in the previous two verses (**For**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Further” or “And in fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:4	bz6k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	οἱ ὄντες ἐν τῷ σκήνει & οὐ θέλομεν ἐκδύσασθαι, ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	Here Paul continues to speak of bodies as buildings and clothing. You should express the ideas as you did in [5:1–3](../05/01.md). Alternate translation: “the ones being in this tent, that is, our mortal body … we do not want to be homeless, but to have a home” or “the ones being in this tent, that is, this body … we do not want to have no body, which is like being unclothed, but to have a resurrection body, which is like being fully clothed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:4	e34b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βαρούμενοι	1	Here Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers were carrying a heavy burden. He means that something is making their lives difficult. The burden could be: (1) how the **tent**, that is, their current bodies, falls apart and dies. Alternate translation: “being distressed by it” (2) how other people’s situations make life hard for them. Alternate translation: “being troubled by many people and things” or “being oppressed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	g9yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βαρούμενοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that either the **tent** (their mortal bodies) or other people and things did it. Make sure your translation fits with how you chose to express the metaphor in the previous note. Alternate translation: “the tent burdening us” or “many people and things burdening us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	f8rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ θέλομεν ἐκδύσασθαι, ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Paul uses the passive form to focus on the state of being **unclothed** or **clothed** rather than on whoever clothes or unclothes them, so you should avoid stating a subject for **unclothed** and **clothed**. Alternate translation: “we do not want to be naked, but to have clothes on” or “we do not want to have no clothing, but to wear clothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	nezo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἐπενδύσασθαι	1	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “but we want to be fully clothed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:4	n78p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸ θνητὸν	1	Paul is using the adjective **mortal** as a noun in order to refer to all bodies that are **mortal**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the mortal bodies” or “what is mortal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:4	e5zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταποθῇ τὸ θνητὸν ὑπὸ τῆς ζωῆς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “life may swallow up the mortal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	de2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καταποθῇ	1	Here Paul refers to **the mortal** as if it were food that could be **swallowed up**. This illustrates that **the mortal** has been defeated as surely as if **life** devoured it as food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may be destroyed” or “may be taken over” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	y0db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ζωῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “live” or an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “what is alive” or “what lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:5	x35l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces development of the ideas from the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:5	m2id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατεργασάμενος ἡμᾶς	1	Here, the phrase **having prepared** could refer to how God: (1) has acted in believers’ lives to get them ready for resurrection and new life. Alternate translation: “having gotten us ready” (2) created believers when they first began to live. Alternate translation: “having created” or “having made us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:5	xr9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸ τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **this very thing** refers back to what Paul said in the previous verse about receiving a new body in place of the one that people have now (see [5:4](../05/04.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what the phrase refers to more explicit. Alternate translation: “receiving resurrection bodies” or “this new life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:5	n20x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ δοὺς	1	Here Paul is adding more information about **God**. He is not distinguishing between different gods. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly adds information instead of distinguishing between people. Alternate translation: “and he has given” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
5:5	g7yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, Paul is speaking of the **Spirit** as if he were a **down payment**, that is, a partial payment for a purchase with a promise to pay the rest of the amount on a future date. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar phrase in [1:22](../01/22.md). Alternate translation: “a guarantee, which is the Spirit, that he will also give us eternal life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:5	kyyw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν ἀρραβῶνα τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to the **down payment** as the **Spirit**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the Spirit as a down payment” or “the down payment that is the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:6	clh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion or inference from what Paul has said in [5:1–6](../05/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion or inference. Alternate translation: “Because of that” or “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:6	xjg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ εἰδότες	1	Here, the word **and** could introduce: (1) additional information. Alternate translation: “and also knowing” (2) a reason why they are **courageous**. Alternate translation: “because we know” (3) something that is true even though they are **courageous**. Alternate translation: “even though we know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:6	bde4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	θαρροῦντες & πάντοτε, καὶ εἰδότες ὅτι ἐνδημοῦντες ἐν τῷ σώματι, ἐκδημοῦμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου;	1	Paul never gives a main verb to go with these statements. Instead, he introduces a parenthetical statement in the following verse and then ends the sentence. At the beginning of [5:8](../05/08.md), he repeats the word that is translated **courageous** here, which indicates that he is going to resume speaking about what he started speaking about in this verse. If you can clearly indicate that Paul does not finish this sentence, you could use that form here, as the ULT does by using a dash. If your readers would find this structure confusing, you could make this verse a complete thought on its own. Alternate translation: “we are always courageous and know that being at home in the body, we are away from the Lord,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
5:6	xv3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐνδημοῦντες ἐν τῷ σώματι, ἐκδημοῦμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Here Paul continues to refer to the **body** as if it were a building that a person could be **at home in**. Express the idea as you did in [5:1–2](../05/01.md). Alternate translation: “living in the body, as if it were a home, we are not present with the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:6	ebl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ σώματι	1	Paul implies that this **body** is the one that people have before they die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this more explicit. Alternate translation: “in our current body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:7	w885		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces an explanation of what it means to be “away from the Lord” (see [5:6](../05/06.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation of a previous statement. Alternate translation: “that means that” or “thus,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:7	rfn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	περιπατοῦμεν	1	Paul speaks of behavior in life as if it were “walking.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “we act” or “we live our lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:7	wok7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ πίστεως & οὐ διὰ εἴδους	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **faith** and **sight**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “believe” and “see.” Alternate translation: “by believing, not by seeing” or “by what we believe, not by what we see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:7	n9el		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ πίστεως & οὐ διὰ εἴδους	1	Here, the words **faith** and **sight** could refer to: (1) the acts of “believing” or “seeing” Jesus the Messiah.

5:8	iq0j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces again what Paul started speaking about in [5:16](../05/06.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that resumes an earlier idea or thought. Alternate translation: “Again,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:8	npio		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **and** could introduce: (1) additional information.

Express the idea as you did in [5:6](../05/06.md). Alternate translation: “not to live in the body as if it were a home but to be present with the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:8	bca2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκδημῆσαι ἐκ τοῦ σώματος	1	Here, the word **body** refers to the body that people have before they die. The phrase **be away from the body** could refer to: (1) a temporary situation between when a believer dies and when Jesus comes back in which the believer does not have a body but is still **with the Lord**. Alternate translation: “to be without a body for now” (2) the eternal situation of believers, in which they either have no bodies or have new bodies. Alternate translation: “to be away from this body forever” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:9	owmc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ καὶ	1	Here, the phrase **And therefore** introduces an inference or conclusion based on what Paul has already said, particularly in [5:6–8](../05/06.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or conclusion based on what has been said. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” or “And so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:9	ml5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴτε ἐνδημοῦντες εἴτε ἐκδημοῦντες	1	Here Paul could be referring to how people are **at home** or **away** from: (1) the Lord. Alternate translation: “whether being at home with the Lord or being away from him” (2) this body. Alternate translation: “whether being at home in this body or being away from it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:9	gadz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	εἴτε ἐνδημοῦντες εἴτε ἐκδημοῦντες	1	Here Paul continues to refer to a building in which a person could be **at home**. Express the idea as you did in [5:6](../05/06.md), [8](../05/08.md). Make sure that your translation matches or fits with what you chose in the previous note about whether Paul implies “body” or “Lord” here. Alternate translation: “whether being in the body as if it were a home or out of the body” or “whether being present or being absent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
5:9	j1sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1	Here, the word **him** refers to the Lord, that is, Jesus, whom Paul mentioned in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what the pronoun refers to. Alternate translation: “to the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:10	k0qb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul and those with him “aspire to be well-pleasing” to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a reason for a previous statement. Alternate translation: “We aspire to that because” or “After all,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:10	awq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	τοὺς & πάντας ἡμᾶς	1	Here, the word **us** could refer to: (1) Paul and everyone who believes, including the Corinthians.

5:10	uv7o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοὺς & πάντας ἡμᾶς φανερωθῆναι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) we reveal ourselves. Alternate translation: “us all to reveal ourselves” or “us all to stand” (2) God reveals us. Alternate translation: “God to reveal us all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:10	kdf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ βήματος τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **judgment seat** refers to a raised seat that a judge or official would sit on when he or she was making official decisions. In Paul’s culture, people expected the Messiah to sit on this kind of seat when this world ends and decide whether to reward or punish people. Paul uses this idea to refer to how Jesus will judge **us all**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit or refer more directly to how **Christ** will judge. Alternate translation: “before the judgment seat that Christ will sit on when he returns” or “before Christ to be judged by him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:10	c499		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κομίσηται & τὰ διὰ τοῦ σώματος	1	In this context, the phrase **receive back** refers to getting something in payment or in return for something else. Paul is speaking as if everyone **will receive back** as payment or recompense exactly what they did **through the body**. By this, Paul means that God will reward or punish everyone in a way that fits with what they did. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may receive a punishment or reward that fits what they did through the body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:10	v8sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

5:10	cr07		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διὰ τοῦ σώματος	1	Here, the phrase **through the body** clarifies that **the {things done}** are what people did while they had mortal bodies and lived on this earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression that refers to what people do in their current bodies. Alternate translation: “with their earthly bodies” or “before they died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:10	nhwf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς ἃ ἔπραξεν	1	Here, the phrase **with regard to what things he did** introduces what **Christ** is judging. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “on the basis of what things he did” or “being judged based on what he did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:10	izpv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἔπραξεν	1	Although the word **he** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any person, either man or woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that applies to both men and women or you could refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “he or she did” or “that person did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
5:10	lsh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴτε ἀγαθὸν εἴτε κακὸν	1	Here, the words **good or bad** could describe: (1) the things that people did.

Alternate translation: “whether reward or rebuke” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:11	hszo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion or inference from what Paul has said in [5:10](../05/10.md).

5:11	dzh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδότες	1	Here, the word **knowing** introduces a reason for why Paul and those with him **persuade men**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “since we know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:11	pa4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν φόβον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify **fear** that is directed toward **the Lord**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the fear that is directed to the Lord” or “the fear that we experience for the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:11	e0c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸν φόβον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **fear**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “fear.” Alternate translation: “how we fear the Lord” or “what it is to fear the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:11	qm34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνθρώπους πείθομεν	1	Here Paul could be implying that he “persuades” people: (1) to know **the fear of the Lord** as he and those with him do. Alternate translation: “we persuade men also to know the fear of the Lord” (2) to realize that he and those with him are people who know **the fear of the Lord** and are thus trustworthy. Alternate translation: “we persuade men that we are those who fear the Lord” or “we persuade men that we are trustworthy” (3) to accept the gospel. Alternate translation: “we persuade men to believe the gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:11	b7dd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how they **persuade men**. In contrast with that, they do not need to persuade God, since they are already **clearly known** by him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “On the other hand,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:11	v11v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Θεῷ & πεφανερώμεθα & πεφανερῶσθαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God knows us clearly … that you know us clearly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:11	qb7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πεφανερώμεθα & ἐν ταῖς συνειδήσεσιν ὑμῶν πεφανερῶσθαι	1	Here Paul does not state what it is about them that is **clearly known**. He implies that **God** knows that Paul and his coworkers are faithful to God and preach the good news properly. Paul wants the Corinthians to recognize this also. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “we are clearly known to be faithful … to be clearly known in your consciences as faithful” or “we are clearly known to preach the truth … to be clearly known in your consciences as one preaching the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:12	r7sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐ πάλιν ἑαυτοὺς συνιστάνομεν ὑμῖν, ἀλλὰ ἀφορμὴν διδόντες ὑμῖν καυχήματος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν, ἵνα ἔχητε πρὸς τοὺς ἐν προσώπῳ καυχωμένους, καὶ μὴ ἐν καρδίᾳ	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the order of the elements here. Alternate translation: “We are giving you an opportunity of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have an answer for the ones boasting in appearance and not in heart. It is not that we are again commending ourselves to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
5:12	ufwe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν	1	Here, the word **again** implies that Paul and those with him had already “commended themselves” at some point in the past. Most likely, this happened when they first met the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this more explicit. See how you translated the similar form in [3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “once more” or “again, like we did at first,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

5:12	e6k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν προσώπῳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **appearance**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “appear” or “look.” Alternate translation: “in what people look like” or “in how things appear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:12	ikd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	μὴ ἐν	1	This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “not boasting in” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:12	it2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν καρδίᾳ	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you express the idea by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by using plain language. Alternate translation: “in who they really are” or “in mind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:13	ys3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said about boasting in the previous verse. In this verse, he indicates that he acts in certain ways **for** the Corinthians, even if he acts in other ways **for God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “In fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:13	e4mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴτε	-1	Here, the word **if** in both places introduces situations that Paul thinks have happened. He is not using **if** to introduce things he thinks might happen. If your language does not use the conditional form for things that definitely happened, you could use another form that refers to alternate situations. Alternate translation: “whenever … whenever” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:13	cy57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξέστημεν & σωφρονοῦμεν	1	Here Paul uses two opposite phrases. These phrases could contrast: (1) fanatical or extreme behavior with moderate or sane behavior. Alternate translation: “we are fanatical … we are moderate” (2) ecstatic or visionary behavior with rational or normal behavior. Alternate translation: “we see visions … we have control of our minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:13	b4ri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεῷ & ὑμῖν	1	Here, the phrases **for God** and **for you** could indicate: (1) the people for whose benefit Paul is behaving in these ways. Alternate translation: “it is for God’s sake … it is for your sake” (2) the people to whom he directs his behavior. Alternate translation: “it is in our relationship with God … it is in our relationship with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:14	a5w7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul acts in the ways that he does (see [5:13](../05/13.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “We do those things because” or “We act in those ways because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:14	azi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ & ἀγάπη τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **love** that could be: (1) **love** that **Christ** has for Paul and those with him. Alternate translation: “the love Christ has for us” (2) **love** that Paul and those with him have for **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the love we have for Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:14	gjmd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ & ἀγάπη τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note about whose **love** this is. Alternate translation: “how Christ loves us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:14	l1y6			κρίναντας	1	Here, the phrase **having judged** could introduce: (1) what he and those with him think about how **the love of Christ controls** them. Alternate translation: “and we have judged” or “as we judge” (2) a reason why **the love of Christ controls** them. Alternate translation: “because we have judged”
5:14	ig7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο, ὅτι	1	Here, the word **this** refers to what Paul is about to say, which he introduces with the word **that**. This form was powerful in his culture. If it would not be powerful in your culture, and if your readers might find both **this** and **that** confusing, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “that” or “what follows:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:14	nd9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	εἷς	1	Paul is using the adjective **one** as a noun in order to refer to **Christ**, who is **one** person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase, and you could make explicit to whom **one** refers. Alternate translation: “one human” or “one human, Christ,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:14	crsa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ	1	Here, the phrase **for the sake of** could indicate that Jesus **died**: (1) to benefit or help others.

Alternate translation: “all humans … all humans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:14	ocra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	πάντων & οἱ πάντες	1	Here, the word **all** could refer in general to all humans, or it could refer more specifically to all humans who believe in Jesus. Since Paul did not clarify which he meant, if possible you also should use a general word that could be interpreted in either way. Alternate translation: “everyone … everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
5:14	nezi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ πάντες ἀπέθανον	1	Here Paul speaks as if **all died** because or when Jesus **died**. Since the following verse states that some people are still “living,” he cannot mean that every person has physically **died**. He may mean that people have **died** to sin, or that they participated in how Christ **died**, or that who they used to be **died**. Since some or all of these interpretations are possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in a form that could allow for several of these interpretations, such as in simile form. Alternate translation: “in a way, all died” or “all died in a manner of speaking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:15	h831		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ	-1	Here, much as in [5:14](../05/14.md), the word **for** could indicate that Jesus **died**: (1) to benefit or help others.

Alternate translation: “in place of … in place of” or “instead of … instead of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:15	b5d1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντων	1	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to refer to **all** people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

5:15	rbbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	πάντων	1	Here, just as in [5:14](../05/14.md), the word **all** could refer in general to all humans, or it could refer more specifically to all humans who believe in Jesus. Express the idea as you did in [5:14](../05/14.md). Alternate translation: “everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
5:15	s4yr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ ζῶντες	1	Here, the phrase **the ones living** could identify people who: (1) have spiritual life, that is, those who have received new life in Jesus. Alternate translation: “the ones having new life” (2) have physical life, that is, who have not died. Alternate translation: “those who are alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:15	bc7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηκέτι ἑαυτοῖς ζῶσιν, ἀλλὰ τῷ	1	Here, to **live for** a person refers to acting in a way that pleases or fulfills that person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit.

5:15	g9k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ τῷ	1	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the verse. Alternate translation: “but they should live for the one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:15	ri6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τῷ	1	Here, the word **one** refers to the same person to whom **he** refers at the beginning of the verse, Jesus the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to whom **one** refers. Alternate translation: “for the Messiah, the ones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:15	h52q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγερθέντι	1	Paul uses the word **raised** to refer to someone coming back to life after they died. If your language does not use this word to describe coming back to life, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “having been restored to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:15	aovc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτῶν & καὶ ἐγερθέντι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “them, the one whom God raised” or “them, whom God raised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:16	ic21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference conclusion from what Paul has said, especially referring back to [5:14–15](../05/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference from previous claims. Alternate translation: “So then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:16	f2ww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τοῦ νῦν & νῦν	1	Here, the word **now** could refer to: (1) the time when **we** believed. Alternate translation: “starting when we believed, … since then” (2) the time in which Paul was writing this letter. Alternate translation: “from the present moment on … right now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:16	t1cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	-1	Here Paul uses the phrase **according to the flesh** to refer to human ways of thinking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to human values or perspectives. Alternate translation: “according to human definitions … according to human definitions” or “according to what humans value … according to what humans value” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:16	y8mk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ	-1	Paul is speaking as **if** it were a possibility that **we regarded Christ according to the flesh** in the past, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can introduce the clause with a word or phrase such as “although” or “despite the fact that.” Alternate translation: “Even though” or “Despite the fact that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
5:17	yx28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the word **Therefore** could introduce an inference from: (1) [5:16](../05/16.md). In this case, Paul is saying that “regarding” Christ in a new way indicates that a person is also a **new creation**. Alternate translation: “Regarding Christ in this new way shows that” (2) [5:14–15](../05/14.md). In this case, Paul is saying that how Christ died for people causes them to be a **new creation**. Alternate translation: “Because Christ died for people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:17	khzj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἴ	1	Here Paul uses the conditional form to show that being **in Christ** leads to being **a new creation**. If the conditional form does not indicate a cause-and-effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **if** statement in a way that does show the relationship. Alternate translation: “as long as” or “supposing that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
5:17	wark		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, indicates that a person believes in Christ and is a Christian. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that the person is a Christian, someone who is united to Christ. Alternate translation: “is a Christian” or “is united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:17	af1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	καινὴ κτίσις	1	Although the word **he** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to any person, either man or woman.

5:17	tl3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καινὴ κτίσις	1	Here Paul does not directly state what is **a new creation**.

5:17	rt67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καινὴ κτίσις	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **creation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “create.” Paul could be focusing on: (1) what is created.

5:17	d7i9			γέγονεν καινά	1	Here, the phrase **new things** could be: (1) the subject of **have come**. Alternate translation: “new things have happened” (2) the object of **have come**, and the subject is the person who is **in Christ**. Alternate translation: “he has become new”
5:17	izkz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	γέγονεν καινά	1	Some early manuscripts include the word “all” in this clause, so that it reads, “all things have become new.” Consider whether translations that your readers might be familiar with include “all.” Otherwise, it is recommended that you follow the ULT here, since the best manuscripts do not include “all.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
5:18	whyb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the development of the ideas from the previous verse.

In this case, Paul is saying something about how **God** accomplishes the reconciliation. Alternate translation: “in Christ God was reconciling” (2) **was**, so that God was **in Christ**, and he was **reconciling** while he was acting **in Christ**. In this case, Paul is saying something about the relationship between **Christ** and **God**, namely that **Christ** is **God**. Alternate translation: “God was in Christ, reconciling” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
5:19	sfrj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Θεὸς & ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**.

Alternate translation: “and he did that by not counting their trespasses against them and by placing in us the word of reconciliation” (2) **not counting** further defines **reconciling**, and **having placed** introduces an action parallel to **reconciling**. Alternate translation: “that is, not counting their trespasses against them, and he was placing in us the word or reconciliation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Alternate translation: “he regarded as a sinner” (2) identified Jesus with sinners and sin. Alternate translation: “he made like a sinner” (3) caused Jesus to be a sin offering. Alternate translation: “he made to be a sin offering” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:21	dmjk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν	1	Here, the phrase **for us** could indicate that God made Jesus **sin**: (1) to benefit or help **us**. Alternate translation: “for our sake” or “for our benefit” (2) instead of or in place of **us**. Alternate translation: “in place of us” or “instead of us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:21	pix7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡμεῖς γενώμεθα δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks as if people could become **the righteousness of God**. He could mean that **we**: (1) share the **righteousness** that God gives to those who believe. Alternate translation: “we might share in the righteousness of God” (2) are declared “righteous” by God. Alternate translation: “we might be declared to have the righteousness of God” (3) become those who live “righteously.” Alternate translation: “we might act according to the righteousness of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:21	kmt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **righteousness** that could: (1) come from **God**. Alternate translation: “righteousness from God” (2) belong to **God**. Alternate translation: “God’s own righteousness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:21	ebz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡμεῖς γενώμεθα δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “righteous.” Make sure your translation fits with how you understand what **righteousness of God** means. Alternate translation: “God might make us righteous” or “we might be righteous because of what God does” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:21	cypg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in him** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in him**, or united to Christ, explains how people **become the righteousness of God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that being united to Christ is the means by which people receive the **righteousness**. Alternate translation: “by being united to him” or “as God unites us to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:intro	f5qu				0	# 2 Corinthians 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * The gospel (5:11–6:2)\n     * Proofs of ministry (6:3–10)\n     * Join with fellow believers, not unbelievers (6:11–7:4)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the quotations from the Old Testament in [6:2](../06/02.md) and [6:16–18](../06/16.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Commendation of ministry\n\nIn [6:3–4](../06/03.md), Paul tells the Corinthians that he avoids doing anything that would cause offense and lead to people blaming ministry. In fact, he and his fellow workers “commend themselves” in many ways, and he provides a list of those ways in [6:4–10](../06/04.md). Paul commends their ministry in this way because other people in Corinth were claiming that Paul was not a good apostle or minister for Christ. They claimed that they were better ministers for Christ. Paul responds here by listing what he and his fellow workers do and experience as true ministers of Christ. Make sure that you express the list so that it shows that Paul and those with him are true ministers of Christ.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “Weapons of righteousness”\n\nIn [6:7](../06/07.md), Paul states that he and his fellow workers have “weapons of righteousness” for both hands. He could mean that righteousness: (1) is the weapons (2) is defended by the weapons (3) characterizes the weapons. Also the idea that the weapons are for both hands could indicate that: (1) Paul and his fellow workers have an offensive weapon in one hand and a defensive weapon in the other hand (2) Paul and his fellow workers can defend against enemies coming from any direction. Paul does not state whom he is fighting against with these weapons, but it is probably sin, evil powers, and people who oppose his ministry. See the notes on this verse for translation options.\n\n### Opening the heart\n\nIn [6:11–13](../06/11.md), Paul speaks about opening the heart and, in contrast, being restricted. He is speaking about loving other people as if it were an open heart and failing to love other people as it were a restriction in one’s insides. If your culture can express the idea of love by referring to where in their bodies people feel love, you could do so in these verses. Otherwise, you could use a comparable metaphor or plain language. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### The temple of the living God\n\nIn [6:16](../06/16.md), Paul claims that believers are the temple of the living God. In the last part of the verse, he quotes from the Old Testament to prove that this is true. This quotation also shows that the identification of God’s people with the temple indicates that God is with his people and treats them as his people. Since the temple is a very important part of Paul’s culture, you should preserve the temple language. If your readers would not understand the metaphor, you could express it as a simile or explain it in a footnote. See the notes on this verse for translation options.\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:14–16](../06/14.md), Paul asks five questions, and each question assumes that the answer is “none” or “nothing.” Paul asks these questions to include the Corinthians in what he is arguing, not because he is looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions, or you could express them as negative statements. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The long list in [6:4–10](../06/04.md)\n\nThese verses contain one long list of the situations and ways in which Paul and his fellow workers commend their ministry. This list is divided into three parts. Each part uses a repeated form for each item. The first part uses the word “in” ([6:4–7a](../06/04.md)), the second part uses the word “through” ([6:7b–8a](../06/07.md)), and the third part uses the words “as” and “yet” or “but” ([6:8b–10](../06/08.md)). If possible, represent these parts in your language by using repeated words or some other natural form. Consider whether a long list like this would be natural in your language. The UST models one possible way to divide the list up into shorter sentences.\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the first person plural. When he uses this form, he is focusing on himself and his fellow workers, or just on himself (although this is less likely). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:1	kf1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces his development of the ideas from the previous verses, especially from [5:20–21](../05/20.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
6:1	tbr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνεργοῦντες	1	Here Paul does not directly state **with** whom he is **working**. He could be implying that he works **with**: (1) God, since God is the subject of the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “working together with God” (2) the Corinthians, since they are the ones whom is “urging.” Alternate translation: “working together with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:1	x4hc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	καὶ, παρακαλοῦμεν	1	Here and throughout this chapter, **we** does not include the Corinthians. The first person plural could refer to: (1) Paul and those who work with him. Alternate translation: “we who preach the good news also urge” (2) just Paul. Alternate translation: “I also urge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:1	s8db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	καὶ, παρακαλοῦμεν μὴ εἰς κενὸν τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ δέξασθαι ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul uses two negative terms, **not** and **in vain**, to indicate a positive meaning. If your language does not use two negative words like this, you could instead use one positive term. Alternate translation: “we also urge you to receive the grace of God, so that it has results” or “we also urge you to receive the grace of God, so that it produces its goal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
6:1	wdla		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **gracious**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “act kindly” or an adverb such as “graciously.” Alternate translation: “how God acts kindly” or “how God acts graciously” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:1	pdgo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς κενὸν	1	Here, **in vain** identifies a cause that does not have its intended effect. In this case, receiving **the grace of God** will not lead to salvation if the Corinthians do not persevere in living as those who have received **the grace of God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you use a word or phrase that identifies a cause that does not have its intended effect. Alternate translation: “for nothing” or “to no purpose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:2	ooms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces a reason why the Corinthians should “receive the grace of God” (see [6:1](../06/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces reason for an exhortation. Alternate translation: “because” or “since” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:2	u9kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγει	1	Here, the phrase **he says** introduces words that God speaks in the Scriptures. Specifically, Paul is quoting from a Greek translation of [Isaiah 49:8](../isa/49/08.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you use a form that indicates that God speaks these words that come from Isaiah. Alternate translation: “according to Isaiah the prophet God says,” or “God speaks these words through Isaiah:” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:2	pp3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	καιρῷ δεκτῷ ἐπήκουσά σου, καὶ ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας ἐβοήθησά σοι. ἰδοὺ, νῦν καιρὸς εὐπρόσδεκτος; ἰδοὺ, νῦν ἡμέρα σωτηρίας	1	The two clauses in the quotation mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Make sure that you use the same form for Paul’s interpretation of the quotation, which is also in parallel form. Alternate translation: “At an acceptable time I listened to you; yes, in a day of salvation I helped you. Behold, now is a favorable time; yes, now is a day of salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:2	kilf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καιρῷ δεκτῷ	1	Here, the phrase **an acceptable time** refers to a point in time that someone considers to be a proper or appropriate for doing something. Paul could be implying that this **time** is **acceptable** to: (1) God. Alternate translation: “At a time that I considered right” or “At a time appropriate for me” (2) people. Alternate translation: “At a time that people considered right” or “At a time appropriate for people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:2	iz3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπήκουσά σου	1	Here, the word **listened** indicates that God both listened and responded. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that God did not just listen but also acted in response. Alternate translation: “I answered you” or “I listened to you and responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:2	be7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σου & σοι	1	Because God is speaking to one person, his special servant, **you** in the quotation is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
6:2	z6w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ σωτηρίας	1	Here, the phrase **day of salvation** refers to the time when God will bring **salvation** for his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in the time of salvation” or “at the time when I gave salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:2	qrdt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σωτηρίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “when I saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:2	sa94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ, νῦν	-1	Here, the words **Behold** and **Look** draw the attention of the audience and ask them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with words or phrases that ask the audience to listen, or you could use another form that draws the audience’s attention to the statements that follow. Alternate translation: “Pay attention! Now … Pay attention! Now” or “Listen, now … Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
6:2	j4k4			καιρὸς εὐπρόσδεκτος & ἡμέρα σωτηρίας	1	Here, the phrases **a day of salvation** and **a favorable time** repeat the words from the quotation exactly, except Paul uses a word that emphasizes that the **time** is good (**favorable**) instead of just being appropriate (**acceptable**). Use the form that you used in the quotation, although, if possible, use a word for a good **time** instead of just an **acceptable time**. Alternate translation: “is a time that God considers good … is a time of salvation” or “is a time appropriate for God … is a time when God gives salvation”
6:3	shtt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	διδόντες	1	Here, the word **giving** goes with the clause “we also urge you” in [6:1](../06/01.md). It introduces an explanation of how Paul and his fellow workers serve God. In most languages, it is best to begin a new sentence with this verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clearly links back to “we also urge” from [6:1](../06/01.md). If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to end the previous verse with a period. Alternate translation: “As we urge you to receive the grace God, we give” or “As we serve God, we give” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
6:3	v3wc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδεμίαν & διδόντες προσκοπήν	1	Here, the phrase **giving no cause for offense** refers to how a person acts so that others are not offended. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form. Alternate translation: “avoiding provoking others” or “doing nothing that would cause offense” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:3	sv9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν μηδενὶ	1	Here, the phrase **in anything** could refer to: (1) actions and behavior. Alternate translation: “in whatever we do” (2) people. Alternate translation: “among anybody” or “to any person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:3	he3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ μωμηθῇ ἡ διακονία	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) other people would do it. Alternate translation: “others might not blame our ministry” (2) God. Alternate translation: “God might not blame our ministry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:4	p6pl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν παντὶ συνιστάντες ἑαυτοὺς ὡς Θεοῦ διάκονοι	1	Here the word **as** could introduce: (1) who they are (**servants of God**) while they **commend** themselves. Alternate translation: “we who are servants of God commend ourselves in everything” (2) what it is that they must **commend** themselves to be. Alternate translation: “we commend ourselves in everything, proving that we are servants of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:4	p9up		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Θεοῦ διάκονοι	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to refer **servants** who serve **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “servants for God” or “God’s servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:4	faw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	Θεοῦ & ἐν ὑπομονῇ πολλῇ, ἐν	1	Here, the phrase **in much endurance** could go with: (1) the list that follows. In this case, the list gives the situation in which they have **much endurance**. Alternate translation: “of God; we have much endurance in” (2) **we commend ourselves**. In this case, the phrase gives an explanation for how they **commend** themselves, and the list gives the situations in which this occurs. Alternate translation: “of God by having much endurance; we show this in” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
6:4	xyf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ὑπομονῇ πολλῇ, ἐν θλίψεσιν, ἐν ἀνάγκαις, ἐν στενοχωρίαις	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **endurance,** **tribulations**, **hardships**, and **distresses**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “enduring at all times while we are persecuted, pressured, and distressed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:4	ndmv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν θλίψεσιν, ἐν ἀνάγκαις, ἐν στενοχωρίαις	1	Here, the words **tribulations**, **hardships**, and **distresses** function together to refer to many different kinds of persecution and suffering. It is possible that **tribulations** refers to direct persecution, **hardships** refers to being forced to do something difficult, and **distresses** refers to being unable to do what one wants. If you do not have three words for these categories, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could use one or two words or phrases to refer to suffering and persecution. Alternate translation: “in persecutions, in suffering” or “in every tribulation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
6:5	ded3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πληγαῖς, ἐν φυλακαῖς, ἐν ἀκαταστασίαις, ἐν κόποις, ἐν ἀγρυπνίαις, ἐν νηστείαις	1	If your language does not express some of these ideas with nouns, you could express the ideas by using verbal phrases or in another natural way. Alternate translation: “in being beaten, in being imprisoned, in being mobbed, in working hard, in sleeping little, in being hungry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:6	w84c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἁγνότητι, ἐν γνώσει, ἐν μακροθυμίᾳ, ἐν χρηστότητι, ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, ἐν ἀγάπῃ ἀνυποκρίτῳ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for these ideas, you could express the ideas by using verbal phrases or adjectives. Alternate translation: “we are pure, knowledgeable, patient, kind, filled with the Holy Spirit, sincerely loving” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:6	e2lc			ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1	Here, the phrase **in the Holy Spirit** could refer to: (1) having the power or help of the **Holy Spirit**. Alternate translation: “in the power of the Holy Spirit” (2) being “holy” in one’s “spirit.” Alternate translation: “in holiness of spirit”
6:7	b6am		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν λόγῳ ἀληθείας, ἐν δυνάμει Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **truth** and **power**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “in the word about what is true, in God empowering us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:7	cr55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Here, the word **word** represents what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the message” or “the communication” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:7	dui6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐν λόγῳ ἀληθείας	1	Here Paul could use the possessive to describe: (1) a **word** about the **truth**. Alternate translation: “in the word about the truth” (2) a **word** that is characterized by **truth**. Alternate translation: “the truthful word” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:7	p5l5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐν δυνάμει Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **power** that comes from **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in the power that comes from God” or “in power given by God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:7	ef5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διὰ τῶν ὅπλων τῆς δικαιοσύνης τῶν δεξιῶν καὶ ἀριστερῶν	1	Here Paul speaks as if **righteousness** were **weapons** for **the right hand and the left**. He means that the righteous way in which he and his fellow workers live their lives is like armor and swords which they use to protect themselves and fight against enemies. Paul does not state who the enemy is, but he implies that it is anyone and anything that acts against God and the gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with simile form or in plain language. Alternate translation: “through righteousness, which is like weapons for the right hand and the left” or “through righteousness, which protects us from God’s enemies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:7	gg43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῶν ὅπλων τῆς δικαιοσύνης	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **weapons** that could: (1) be **righteousness**.

6:7	ozxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ὅπλων τῆς δικαιοσύνης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “righteous” or an adverb such as “righteously.” Alternate translation: “weapons, that is, how we live righteously,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:7	ijr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς δικαιοσύνης τῶν δεξιῶν καὶ ἀριστερῶν	1	Here, having **weapons** for **the right hand and the left** could describe how a soldier: (1) has an offensive weapon in one hand and a defensive weapon in the other. Alternate translation: “of righteous, both a sword and a shield” or “of righteousness for attack and defense” (2) is completely equipped for battle and able to defend against attacks from **right** and **left**. Alternate translation: “of righteous for defense on all sides” or “of righteousness with which we are fully equipped” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:8	ftu0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ δόξης καὶ ἀτιμίας, διὰ δυσφημίας καὶ εὐφημίας	1	In these two statements, Paul indicates that he and his fellow workers persevere in serving God whether people think and say good things or bad things about them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “whether we receive honor or dishonor, whether there are bad reports or good reports about us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:8	m51w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δόξης καὶ ἀτιμίας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **honor** and **dishonor**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “honor” and “dishonor.” Alternate translation: “being honored and dishonored” or “others glorifying us and disgracing us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:8	fedq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς πλάνοι καὶ ἀληθεῖς	1	Here and in the following two verses Paul uses **as** to introduce what other people think about him and his fellow workers and then **yet** to introduce what is really true about them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally expresses a contrast between what people think and what is actually true. Alternate translation: “considered to be deceivers, but actually true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:8	e4pf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀληθεῖς	1	Paul is using the adjective **true** as a noun in order to identify himself and his fellow workers as those who truly are who they say they are. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “truthful people” or “telling the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
6:9	niij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς ἀγνοούμενοι καὶ ἐπιγινωσκόμενοι, ὡς ἀποθνῄσκοντες καὶ ἰδοὺ, ζῶμεν, ὡς παιδευόμενοι καὶ μὴ θανατούμενοι	1	Here and in the following verse Paul uses **as** to introduce what other people think about him and his fellow workers, and then he uses **yet** to introduce what is really true about them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally expresses a contrast between what people think and what is actually true. Alternate translation: “considered to be unknown, but actually well known; considered to be dying, but actually—behold!—living; considered to be being disciplined, but actually not being put to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:9	fcb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς ἀγνοούμενοι καὶ ἐπιγινωσκόμενοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the actions, Paul could be implying that he is: (1) **unknown** to many people but **known** to God. Alternate translation: “many people not knowing us, yet God knowing us well” (2) **unknown** to some people, but **known** to other people. Alternate translation: “some people not knowing us, yet others knowing us well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:9	x7bu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	καὶ ἰδοὺ, ζῶμεν	1	Here, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could use another form that draws the audience’s attention to the statement that follows. Alternate translation: “yet, and listen to this, living” or “yet most certainly living” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
6:9	r1d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς παιδευόμενοι καὶ μὴ θανατούμενοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the actions, Paul could be implying that: (1) God does them. Alternate translation: “God disciplining us yet not putting us to death” (2) other people do them. Alternate translation: “people disciplining us yet not putting us to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:9	nqcv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ θανατούμενοι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die” or “kill.” Alternate translation: “yet not being killed” or “not dying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:10	so04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς λυπούμενοι ἀεὶ δὲ χαίροντες, ὡς πτωχοὶ πολλοὺς δὲ πλουτίζοντες, ὡς μηδὲν ἔχοντες καὶ πάντα κατέχοντες	1	Here, just as in the previous verse, Paul uses **as** to introduce what other people think about him and his fellow workers and then **yet** or **but** to introduce what is really true about them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally expresses a contrast between what people think and what is actually true. Alternate translation: “considered to be sorrowful, but actually always rejoicing; considered to be poor, but actually making many rich; considered to have nothing, but actually possessing all things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:10	vydj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πολλοὺς & πλουτίζοντες	1	Here Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers made other people **rich**. He means that he helps people receive blessings from God, including forgiveness and new life, which makes them spiritually **rich**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “making many spiritually rich” or “enabling many to receive new life, which is like being rich” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:10	pajk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοὺς	1	Paul is using the adjective **many** as a noun in order to refer **many** people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “many others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
6:10	fpqg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντα	1	Here Paul could be stating that they possess: (1) **all things** that Christ possesses. In other words, because Christ rules over everything, Paul and his fellow workers also possess everything. Alternate translation: “all things in Christ” (2) **all** spiritual blessings, which are the important **things**. Alternate translation: “all spiritual blessings” or “everything that is really important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:11	mv85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν ἀνέῳγεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς, Κορίνθιοι, ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν πεπλάτυνται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the actions, Paul implies that he and his fellow workers did them. Alternate translation: “We have opened our mouth toward you, Corinthians; we have opened our heart wide” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:11	v74j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν & ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν	1	Here, the words **mouth** and **heart** are singular nouns that refer to the mouths and hearts of Paul and his fellow workers. It may be more natural in your language to use plural forms. Alternate translation: “Each of our mouths … each of our hearts”
6:11	r815		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν & ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν	1	Here, the word **mouth** refers to the action of speaking with the **mouth**, and the word **heart** refers to the act of thinking and feeling with the **heart**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that refer to the actions rather than to where the actions occur. Alternate translation: “Our speaking … our feeling” or “How we speak … how we feel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:11	jvak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν ἀνέῳγεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers had **opened** their mouths **toward** the Corinthians. He means that he and his fellow workers have spoken what is true, and they have spoken confidently. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. Paul could be specifically referring to: (1) how he and his fellow workers have interacted with the Corinthians in the past. Alternate translation: “We have always spoken confidently and truthfully to you” (2) what he has said in this letter so far. Alternate translation: “We have written confidently and truthfully to you” (3) what he said in [6:3–10](../06/03.md). Alternate translation: “We wrote those things to you confidently and truthfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:11	w42w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν πεπλάτυνται	1	Here Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers have **opened wide** their “hearts” to the Corinthians. He means that they love and care for the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. Alternate translation: “we have made room in our hearts for you” or “we love you very much” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:12	m2kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ στενοχωρεῖσθε ἐν ἡμῖν, στενοχωρεῖσθε δὲ ἐν τοῖς σπλάγχνοις ὑμῶν	1	Here Paul speaks about loving others as if it were about having space in one’s insides. When people have space for other people inside them (**not restricted**), they are loving and caring for others. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “There is space for you in our hearts, but you do not have space for us in your hearts” or “You are being loved by us, but you are not fully loving us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:12	u4fz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ στενοχωρεῖσθε ἐν ἡμῖν, στενοχωρεῖσθε δὲ ἐν τοῖς σπλάγχνοις ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “We are not restricting you, but your affections are restricting you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:12	p88s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τοῖς σπλάγχνοις ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **affections**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “feel.” Alternate translation: “what you feel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:13	ypsz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τὴν δὲ αὐτὴν ἀντιμισθίαν (ὡς τέκνοις λέγω) πλατύνθητε καὶ ὑμεῖς	1	Here, the clause **I speak as to children** is a parenthetical statement that breaks up the sentence to give more information about how Paul is speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move the clause to wherever it is most natural to put a statement about how one is speaking. Alternate translation: “and—I speak as to children—in the same exchange, open yourselves wide also” or “and in the same exchange, open yourselves wide also—I speak as to children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
6:13	b62y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν & αὐτὴν ἀντιμισθίαν	1	Here, the phrase **same exchange** refers to how Paul and his fellow workers have “opened their hearts” (that is, shown love) to the Corinthians. This is the first part of the **exchange**, and now Paul wants the Corinthians to complete this **exchange** by opening themselves to Paul and his fellow workers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express what is being exchanged more explicitly. Alternate translation: “now that we have opened our hearts to you, in exchange” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:13	zdfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς τέκνοις λέγω	1	Here Paul indicates that he is speaking as if he were addressing **children**. He could mean that: (1) he is using words and ideas that children use, particularly referring to the idea of **exchange**. Alternate translation: “I am using childish language” or “I speak as children speak to each other” (2) he is speaking to the Corinthians as if he was their father and they were his children. Alternate translation: “I speak to you who are like my own children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
6:13	c6vp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλατύνθητε καὶ ὑμεῖς	1	Here Paul continues to speak about loving others as if it were about having space in one’s insides. When people have space for other people inside them, they love and care for them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar clause at the end of [6:11](../06/11.md). Alternate translation: “make space in your hearts also” or “love us also” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:14	qd33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ γίνεσθε ἑτεροζυγοῦντες ἀπίστοις	1	Here Paul refers to a farming practice in which two or more animals were **yoked together** with a piece of wood that was then connected to a plow or cart. In this way, the animals together pulled the plow or cart. Paul applies this farming practice to people to indicate that believers should not try to accomplish what God wants them to do by working with **unbelievers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do not team up with unbelievers” or “Do not have a close relationship with unbelievers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:14	x89j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ γίνεσθε ἑτεροζυγοῦντες	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that people do it to themselves. Alternate translation: “Do not yoke yourselves together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:14	v7kk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces some reasons why the Corinthians should not be **yoked** with **unbelievers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces reasons for a command. Alternate translation: “because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:14	v7pw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς & μετοχὴ δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἀνομίᾳ, ἢ τίς κοινωνία φωτὶ πρὸς σκότος?	1	Here Paul is using the question form to deny that something could be true. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could express the idea by using strong negations. Alternate translation: “righteousness and lawlessness cannot have partnership! Nor can light and darkness have fellowship!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:14	n5so		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τίς & μετοχὴ δικαιοσύνῃ καὶ ἀνομίᾳ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **partnership**, **righteousness**, and **lawlessness**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “can righteous people and lawless people partner” or “can what is righteous partner with what is lawless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:14	xr52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τίς κοινωνία φωτὶ πρὸς σκότος?	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **fellowship**, **light**, and **darkness**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “can what is bright go together with what is dark” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:14	h9ks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τίς κοινωνία φωτὶ πρὸς σκότος?	1	Here Paul speaks about how **light** and **darkness** do not have **fellowship**. He could be speaking about: (1) things and people that are good (**light**) and things and people that are evil (**darkness**). Alternate translation: “what fellowship do good people have with evil people” (2) God’s kingdom and people (**light**) and Satan’s kingdom and people (**darkness**). Alternate translation: “what fellowship does God’s kingdom have with Satan’s kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:15	r1vq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς δὲ συμφώνησις Χριστοῦ πρὸς Βελιάρ, ἢ τίς μερὶς πιστῷ μετὰ ἀπίστου	1	Here, just as in [6:14](../06/14.md), Paul is using the question form to deny that something could be true. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could express the idea by using strong negations. Alternate translation: “And Christ has no harmony with Beliar! Nor does a believer have a share with an unbeliever!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:15	f832		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τίς δὲ συμφώνησις Χριστοῦ πρὸς Βελιάρ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **harmony**, you could express the idea by using verbs such as “agree” or “go together.” Alternate translation: “And does Christ go together with Beliar” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:15	rm3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Βελιάρ	1	Here, the word **Beliar** is another name for the devil, who is also called Satan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a footnote or short phrase that clarifies that **Beliar** is another name for Satan. Alternate translation: “Beliar, that is, Satan” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
6:15	z9iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τίς μερὶς πιστῷ μετὰ ἀπίστου	1	Here Paul is speaking of believers and unbelievers in general, not of one particular **believer** and one particular **unbeliever**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this form with a form that refers to believers and unbelievers in general. Alternate translation: “what share does any believer have with any unbeliever” or “what share do believers have with unbelievers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
6:16	y99x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς δὲ συνκατάθεσις ναῷ Θεοῦ μετὰ εἰδώλων?	1	Here, just as in [6:14–15](../06/14.md), Paul is using the question form to deny that something could be true. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “And the temple of God has no agreement with idols!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:16	m658		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τίς & συνκατάθεσις ναῷ Θεοῦ μετὰ εἰδώλων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **agreement**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “agree.” Alternate translation: “does the temple of God agree with idols” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
6:16	jc79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what Paul said about **the temple of God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “Now” or “As a matter of fact,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
6:16	s3l8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	Here, the word **we** refers to everyone who believes in Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:16	aqql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡμεῖς & ναὸς Θεοῦ ἐσμεν ζῶντος	1	Here Paul speaks as if **we** were a **temple**. He follows this metaphor with a quotation which illustrates how God dwells with his people as their God. Since the **temple** is an important building in Paul’s culture, if possible you should preserve the language. If necessary, you could express the idea by using a simile form. Alternate translation: “we are like the temple of the living God” or “the living God dwells with us as if we were his temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:16	oc16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεοῦ & ζῶντος	2	Here, the phrase **the living God** identifies God as the one who lives and possibly as the one who gives life. The primary point is that God is actually alive, unlike idols and other things that people call their gods. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really lives. See how you translated the similar phrase in [3:3](../03/03.md). Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:16	es7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καθὼς εἶπεν ὁ Θεὸς	1	Here, the phrase **just as God said** introduces a quotation that supports what Paul has said about how **we are the temple of the living God**. The words Paul quotes could come from [Leviticus 26:12](../lev/26/12.md); [Jeremiah 31:33](../jer/31/33.md); and [Ezekiel 37:27](../ezk/37/27.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the words that God speaks are from the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “just as God spoke through the prophets” or “as God spoke in the Old Testament” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:16	u5g3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐνοικήσω ἐν αὐτοῖς, καὶ ἐνπεριπατήσω	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will dwell among them; yes, I will walk among them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:16	g0nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνπεριπατήσω	1	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if God would **walk** among his people. He means that God will be as close to his people as if he were walking around with them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “spend time with them” or “be close to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:16	vy1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί	1	Here, the word translated **themselves** switches focus from **God** to **they**. Consider using a natural way to switch the focus to **they** in your language. Alternate translation: “it is they who will be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
6:17	fe1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	διὸ ἐξέλθατε ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν καὶ ἀφορίσθητε, λέγει Κύριος, καὶ	1	Here Paul uses the words **Therefore** and **says the Lord** to introduce a quotation that provides a result or inference from what Paul said in the previous verse. Most of the quotation is from [Isaiah 52:11](../isa/52/11.md), but the phrase **and I will welcome you** is from a Greek translation of [Ezekiel 20:34](../ezk/20/34.md). The ULT indicates that the quote is from two different passages by using new quotation marks with the last line. However, it is recommended that you treat the whole verse as one quote in your translation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could introduce the quote in a natural way which shows that it comes from the Old Testament. It may be more natural to move **says the Lord** to the beginning of the verse, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “Because of that, the Lord says {through the prophets}, ‘Come out from the midst of them, and be separate, and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:17	peek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐξέλθατε ἐκ μέσου αὐτῶν καὶ ἀφορίσθητε	1	Here, these two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Come out from the midst of them; yes, be separate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:17	z5ld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῶν	1	Here, the word **them** refers to people who do not follow God and who do not trust the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to whom the pronoun refers. Alternate translation: “of the unbelievers” or “of the people who do not follow God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
6:17	vfie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀκαθάρτου μὴ ἅπτεσθε	1	Here the author of the quotation uses the word **touch** to refer to interacting with someone in any way, not just by touching it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “come into contact with no unclean things” or “avoid every unclean thing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:17	jg48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	κἀγὼ	1	Here, the word **and** introduces what happens when people do what God commanded in the first part of the verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that more clearly introduces a result. Alternate translation: “and then I” or “and when you do those things, I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:18	ft65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καὶ	1	Here Paul uses the word **And** to introduce another quote from the Old Testament, specifically from [2 Samuel 7:8](../2sa/07/08.md) and [2 Samuel 7:14](../2sa/07/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clarifies that Paul is quoting from the Old Testament. Alternate translation: “Again, as you can read in the Scriptures,” or “Even more, as it is written,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:18	dks6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἔσομαι ὑμῖν εἰς πατέρα, καὶ ὑμεῖς ἔσεσθέ μοι εἰς υἱοὺς καὶ θυγατέρας	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will be to you as a Father; yes, you will be to me as sons and daughters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
7:intro	hg36				0	# 2 Corinthians 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul’s ministry (2:14–7:4)\n     * Join with fellow believers, not unbelievers (6:11–7:4)\n5. Paul rejoices about Titus’ visit to the Corinthians (7:5–16)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Boasting\n\nIn [7:4](../07/04.md), [14](../07/14.md), Paul refers to how he boasts about the Corinthians. What he means is that he tells people about how wonderful and great he thinks they are. It is important to indicate that Paul is not describing the Corinthians as better than they actually are. Rather, Paul indicates in [7:14](../07/14.md) that what he says about them is actually true. Use a word or phrase that refers to saying good things that are true about someone else. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/boast]])\n\n### Encouragement and comfort\n\nThe words for “encouragement” and “comfort” are very closely related. Sometimes it is not clear whether Paul is focusing more on encouragement (which implies urging someone to act) or more on comfort (which implies making someone feel better). If you have a word or phrase that can indicate both comfort and encouragement, you could use it in this chapter. Otherwise, consider which emphasis the context implies. Generally, the ULT models one option, and the UST models the other option. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/comfort]])\n\n### The previous letter\n\nIn [7:8–12](../07/08.md), Paul refers to a letter that he had already written and sent to the Corinthians. He has already referred to this letter in chapter 2. While a few scholars think this letter is 1 Corinthians, most likely we do not have this previous letter. Paul acknowledges that this previous letter might have “grieved” them, but he wants them to know that he wrote the letter to help them do what was right. In your translation, make sure that these verses refer to a letter that Paul previously wrote, not to 2 Corinthians.\n\n### Grief and sorrow\n\nThe words for being “grieved” and for “sorrow” are very closely related. Paul uses these words to refer to being hurt or feeling upset about something. Paul distinguishes between two kinds of sorrow: one that is with respect to God,   godly sorrow; the other is with respect to the world, worldly sorrow. If possible, use a word or words that are general enough to refer to both kinds of sorrow.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the words “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to himself and those who work with him. He does not include the Corinthians except in [7:1](../07/01.md). You should assume that Paul only means himself and his fellow workers unless a note specifies otherwise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### Switches between first person singular and first person plural\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul switches between singular forms (“I”) and plural forms (“we”) of the first person. These switches are probably not just stylistic. Rather, they indicate when Paul is referring just to himself and when he is referring to himself and those who serve with him. If possible, preserve these switches in your translation.\n\n### What happened in Corinth\n\nIn this chapter, Paul continues to refer to something that happened in Corinth, something he already discussed in chapter 2. However, Paul gives even less details here than he did in chapter 2 about what happened. What we know is that a person, probably a man from the Corinthians’ group, did something wrong and hurt some of the Corinthians and possibly also hurt Paul. In response, Paul wrote a severe letter that “grieved” the Corinthians. Paul also sent Titus to Corinth to make sure that everything was resolved. In this chapter, Paul especially focuses on how happy he was to hear what Titus told him about how the Corinthians responded. Avoid providing more details in this chapter than Paul does, but make sure that your translation generally refers to events like these.
7:1	h5xv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference from what Paul has already said, especially what he said in [6:16–18](../06/16.md) about being God’s temple and family. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference from a previous section. Alternate translation: “Because of that” or “On account of those things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:1	k46r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1	Here, the word **having** introduces a reason why believers should **cleanse** themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “since we have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:1	tytd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ταύτας & ἔχοντες τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **promises**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise” or “pledge.” Alternate translation: “having been promised these things” or “God having pledged these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:1	pw5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταύτας & τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1	Here Paul is referring to the **promises** from the Old Testament that he quoted in [6:16–18](../06/16.md), which indicate that believers are God’s people, that God will welcome them, and that they are God’s sons and daughters. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly refers back to those **promises**. Alternate translation: “the promises that I have quoted” or “those promises” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:1	gwjt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	καθαρίσωμεν ἑαυτοὺς	1	By **us** and **ourselves**, Paul means himself, his fellow workers, and the Corinthians, so use the inclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
7:1	fv49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	παντὸς μολυσμοῦ σαρκὸς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **defilement**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “defile” or “corrupt.” Alternate translation: “anything that corrupts flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:1	f00w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σαρκὸς καὶ πνεύματος	1	Here Paul uses the word **flesh** to refer to the outward part of people, particularly the body. He uses the word **spirit** to refer to the inward part of people, the part that thinks, feels, and makes decisions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that refer to similar parts of a person. Alternate translation: “of body and soul” or “of the physical and the spiritual” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:1	turq			ἐπιτελοῦντες	1	Here, the word **perfecting** could introduce: (1) another thing that believers should do while they are cleansing themselves. Alternate translation: “and let us perfect” or “as we perfect” (2) the result of the “cleansing.” Alternate translation: “so that we perfect” (3) how they “cleanse” themselves. Alternate translation: “by perfecting”
7:1	c2xf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπιτελοῦντες ἁγιωσύνην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **holiness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “holy.” Alternate translation: “perfecting how holy we are” or “growing to be perfectly holy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:1	pt41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	φόβῳ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify **fear** that is directed toward **God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. See how you translated the similar phrase “fear of the Lord” in [5:11](../05/11.md). Alternate translation: “the fear that is directed to God” or “the fear that we experience for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
7:1	xlet		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν φόβῳ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **fear**, you could express the idea by using a verbal form of “fear.” Alternate translation: “in how we fear God” or “through fearing God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:2	x55b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	χωρήσατε ἡμᾶς; οὐδένα ἠδικήσαμεν, οὐδένα ἐφθείραμεν, οὐδένα ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν	1	Here and in the rest of this chapter, by **us** and **we** Paul means himself and his fellow workers but not the Corinthians, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
7:2	c2yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	χωρήσατε ἡμᾶς	1	Here, just as in [6:11–13](../06/11.md), Paul speaks of loving others as if it were about having space for others in one’s insides. When people have space for other people inside them, they are loving and caring for them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Show love for us” or “Make room in your hearts for us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:2	v4nu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	οὐδένα ἠδικήσαμεν, οὐδένα ἐφθείραμεν, οὐδένα ἐπλεονεκτήσαμεν	1	Here Paul uses three phrases with similar structure and meaning to strongly deny that he did anything to hurt any of the Corinthians. It is possible that the word **wronged** refers to doing something unjust, the word **ruined** refers to corrupting or perverting someone, and the phrase **took advantage of** refers to gaining money or things from somebody without doing anything in return. If the repetition would not communicate a strong denial in your language, or if you do not have three words for these ideas, you could express the idea with only one or two strong clauses. Alternate translation: “We wronged and took advantage of no one” or “We did not hurt any person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:3	pgze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ λέγω	1	Here Paul refers to what he said in the previous verse about how he and his fellow workers did not hurt anyone ([7:2](../07/02.md)). Here he wishes to clarify that he does not mean that it was the Corinthians who hurt people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “I did not speak what I just spoke” or “I did not write that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:3	bhb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρὸς κατάκρισιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **condemnation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to condemn you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:3	ckpm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προείρηκα	1	Here Paul refers back to what he said in [6:11](../06/11.md): “our heart has been opened wide.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “I told you earlier in this letter” or “I wrote above in this letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:3	fay3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν ἐστε	1	Here Paul speaks as if the Corinthians were in the **hearts** of him and his fellow workers. He means that they love the Corinthians very much. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are in our affections” or “we love you very much” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:3	xzg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	εἰς τὸ συναποθανεῖν καὶ συνζῆν	1	Here Paul refers to two extreme alternates, dying and living, to indicate that nothing that happens will keep him and his fellow workers from loving the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “come what may” or “whatever may happen to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
7:4	uamr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πολλή μοι παρρησία πρὸς ὑμᾶς, πολλή μοι καύχησις ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **confidence** and **boasting**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “I am very confident about you; I boast greatly on your behalf” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:4	yp45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μοι παρρησία πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul could be saying that he: (1) is confident that they follow Christ and do what is right. Alternate translation: “is my confidence that you follow Christ” or “is my confidence that you are doing well” (2) can speak boldly or confidently to them. Alternate translation: “is my boldness in speaking to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:4	mh12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πεπλήρωμαι τῇ παρακλήσει	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that the Corinthians did it. Alternate translation: “You have filled me with encouragement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:4	k5t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ παρακλήσει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **encouragement**, you could express the idea by using a verbal form such as “encourage” or “comfort.” Alternate translation: “how you urge me onward” or “how you comfort me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:4	mx9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑπερπερισσεύομαι τῇ χαρᾷ	1	Here Paul speaks as if he were “overflowing” with **joy**. He means that he has so much **joy** that he feels like it has completely filled him up. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “I am exceedingly joyful” or “I have so much joy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:4	mr75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑπερπερισσεύομαι τῇ χαρᾷ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rejoice” or an adjective such as “joyful.” Alternate translation: “I overflow as I rejoice” or “I overflow with how joyful I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:5	rt1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γὰρ	1	Here, the phrase **For even** introduces further explanation of the “afflictions” that Paul mentioned in [7:4](../07/04.md). However, Paul is also speaking again about what he said in [2:13](../02/13.md) about traveling to Macedonia. Consider a natural way to reintroduce Paul’s travel plans, and if possible, use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation of the afflictions. Alternate translation: “Speaking of afflictions, I will tell you more about my journeys:” or “Now as for the travels I have spoken about,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
7:5	f3c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθόντων ἡμῶν εἰς	1	In a context such as this, it may be more natural in your language to say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “having gone to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
7:5	c8ju		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἡ σὰρξ ἡμῶν	1	Here, the phrase **our flesh** refers to the whole person. Paul uses it to emphasize the physical or bodily nature of their suffering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the whole person and not just their **flesh**. Alternate translation: “we ourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:5	zwwy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδεμίαν ἔσχηκεν ἄνεσιν	1	Here Paul continues what he was saying in [2:13](../02/13.md) about how he “had no relief” in his “spirit.” What he means is that traveling to **Macedonia** did not help with his concerns about Titus or his sufferings. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “had no relief from our sufferings and worries at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:5	byp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐδεμίαν ἔσχηκεν ἄνεσιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **relief**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “relieve” or “rest.” Alternate translation: “was not relieved at all” or “could not rest at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:5	h3cv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	θλιβόμενοι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “we were experiencing afflictions” or “people were afflicting us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:5	i4wr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔξωθεν μάχαι, ἔσωθεν φόβοι	1	Here, the word **without** identifies the source of the **conflicts** as external to Paul and those with him. The word **within** identifies the source of the **fears** as internal to Paul and his fellow workers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that similarly identify internal and external sources. Alternate translation: “conflicts from others, fears from ourselves” or “conflicts on the outside, fears on the inside” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:5	zkqr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔξωθεν μάχαι, ἔσωθεν φόβοι	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **conflicts** and **fears**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “quarrel” and “fear.” Alternate translation: “people fought us without, and we feared within” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:6	qdto		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with the “conflicts” and “fears” that Paul described in the previous verse ([7:5](../07/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “In spite of that,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
7:6	p3fw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ παρακαλῶν τοὺς ταπεινοὺς	1	Here Paul is adding more information about **God**. He is not distinguishing between different gods. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly adds information instead of distinguishing between people. Alternate translation: “who is the one who comforts the humble” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
7:6	oe9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ταπεινοὺς	1	Paul is using the adjective **humble** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **humble**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the humble people” or “those who are humble” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
7:6	uujt			ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ Τίτου	1	Alternate translation: “by sending Titus to us”
7:7	z6jd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ παρακλήσει ᾗ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **comfort**, you could express the idea in another way.

7:7	w7td		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παρεκλήθη ἐφ’ ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you comforted him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:7	nypy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀναγγέλλων	1	Here, the word **reporting** introduces how Paul knows about the **comfort** that the Corinthians gave to Titus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally introduces how Paul knows about what happened in Corinth. Alternate translation: “since he reported” or “which we heard about when he reported” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:7	ljis		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ὑμῶν ἐπιπόθησιν, τὸν ὑμῶν ὀδυρμόν, τὸν ὑμῶν ζῆλον ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **longing**, **mourning**, and **zeal**, you could express the ideas in another way.

7:7	hzt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ὑμῶν ἐπιπόθησιν, τὸν ὑμῶν ὀδυρμόν, τὸν ὑμῶν ζῆλον ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **for my sake** modifies all three items in this list. The Corinthians experience **longing** to see Paul, they experience **mourning** because they grieved Paul, and they have **zeal** for Paul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make these ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “your longing for me, your mourning concerning me, and your zeal for my sake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:7	xojr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	με & χαρῆναι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that the Corinthians did it. Alternate translation: “you caused me to rejoice” or “what you did caused me to rejoice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:7	fifc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μᾶλλον	1	Here, Paul speaks about how his joy upon receiving the report from Titus is **even more** than the joy that he already described in [7:4](../07/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the comparison more explicit. Alternate translation: “even more than I already had rejoiced” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:8	zuvp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces Paul’s explanation of why he “rejoices even more” (see [7:7](../07/07.md)). This explanation continues in [7:9](../07/09.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “Here is why I rejoice even more:” or “That is because,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
7:8	ptq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ	1	Here Paul is speaking as if grieving them were only a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it was actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “although” or “though.” Alternate translation: “although” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
7:8	lzww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ ἐπιστολῇ & ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἐκείνη	1	Here Paul again refers to a letter that he previously sent to them. See how you referred to this letter in [2:3–9](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “my previous letter … the letter” or “the letter that I sent you before … that letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:8	wlbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	εἰ καὶ μετεμελόμην (βλέπω ὅτι ἡ ἐπιστολὴ ἐκείνη, εἰ καὶ πρὸς ὥραν ἐλύπησεν ὑμᾶς)	1	Here, the phrase **Even if I was regretting {it}** could go with: (1) “now I rejoice” in [7:9](../07/09.md). In other words, although Paul may have regretted sending the letter, now he rejoices. Alternate translation: “Even if I was regretting it—I see that that letter grieved you, if only for an hour—” (2) **I see**. In other words, Paul may have regretted sending the letter because he saw that it **grieved** the Corinthians. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to begin a new sentence with the following verse. Alternate translation: “Even if I was regretting it, it was because I see that that letter grieved you, if only for an hour.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
7:8	b552		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ καὶ μετεμελόμην	1	Here, the phrase **Even if** could introduce: (1) something that Paul did in the past but does not do now. In other words, Paul wishes to indicate that he “regretted” sending the letter after he sent it, but he does not regret it now. Alternate translation: “Even though I was regretting it then” (2) something that Paul did not actually do. In other words, Paul wishes to indicate that he might have “regretted” sending the letter, but there is no possibility of that now. Alternate translation: “Even though I might have regretted it”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
7:8	vk7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βλέπω	1	Here, the word **seeing** refers generally to “knowing” something, not just to looking with one’s eyes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that clearly refers to knowing. Alternate translation: “I recognize” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:8	ftuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	βλέπω	1	Here, some manuscripts have “for I see,” and a few manuscripts have “seeing.” However, the best manuscripts have “I see.” Unless your readers are already familiar with one of these other wordings, it is best to follow the ULT here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
7:8	b2xj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ	3	Here Paul is speaking as if being grieved **for an hour** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it was actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “though.” Alternate translation: “though only” or “although just” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
7:8	ob23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πρὸς ὥραν	1	Here Paul uses the word **hour** to refer to a short period of time, but he does not specify how short.

Alternate translation: “for a brief time” or “for a short while” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:9	z820		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐχ ὅτι ἐλυπήθητε, ἀλλ’ ὅτι ἐλυπήθητε εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	If your language would not naturally put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse the two clauses here. Alternate translation: “that you were grieved to the point of repentance, not that you were grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
7:9	kn5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐλυπήθητε	-1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that he himself or his letter did it. Alternate translation: “I grieved you … I grieved you … I grieved you” or “my letter grieved you … it grieved you … my letter grieved you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:9	i8n0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **repentance**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “repent.” Alternate translation: “so that you repented” or “in such a way that you repented” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:9	lmw9			κατὰ Θεόν	1	Here, the phrase **with respect to God** indicates that how the Corinthians **were grieved** was how God desires people to be grieved. In other words, their “grief” was pleasing to God or “godly.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses this idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “in a godly way” or “as God approves”
7:9	cg0o			Θεόν, ἵνα	1	Here, the word translated **so that** could introduce: (1) a result. Alternate translation: “God, with the result that” (2) a purpose. Alternate translation: “God in order that”
7:9	l6d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν μηδενὶ ζημιωθῆτε ἐξ ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul explains that the Corinthians were not harmed or injured in any way by how they **were grieved**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “you did not lose anything because of us” or “you were not harmed in any way by us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:10	y0gi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse ([7:9](../07/09.md)) about “grief with respect to God” and how it does not lead to “suffering loss.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
7:10	dtm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ & κατὰ Θεὸν λύπη	1	Here Paul uses words very similar to those he used in [7:9](../07/09.md): “you were grieved with respect to God.” Use a similar form to what you used there. Alternate translation: “the godly sorrow” or “the sorrow that God approves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:10	wmtx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ & κατὰ Θεὸν λύπη, μετάνοιαν εἰς σωτηρίαν ἀμεταμέλητον ἐργάζεται	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **sorrow**, **repentance**, **salvation**, and **regret**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “being grieved with respect to God causes people to repent so that they are saved and do not regret being grieved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:10	lc4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀμεταμέλητον	1	Here, the phrase **without regret** could describe: (1) how those who have **sorrow with respect to God** do not experience **regret**.

8:intro	kl7m				0	# 2 Corinthians 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Giving for the gospel (8:1–9:15)\n     * Example of the Macedonians (8:1–6)\n     * Paul appeals to the Corinthians to give generously (8:7–9:5)\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quotation from [Exodus 16:18](../exo/16/18.md) in [8:15](../08/15.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The collection for the church in Jerusalem\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul encourages the Corinthians to finish collecting the money they were going to contribute to what Paul was gathering to send to the believers in Jerusalem. Paul sometimes calls participating in this collection a grace. He often refers to this collection indirectly, which was a polite way to talk about financial matters in his culture. If people in your culture speak more directly about financial matters, you may need to make some of the ideas more explicit. In order to encourage the Corinthians to give to this collection, Paul tells them that the Macedonian believers have already given generously ([8:1–5](../08/01.md)), states reasons why the Corinthians should give ([8:6–15](../08/06.md)), and assures the Corinthians that the people who are managing the collection are trustworthy ([8:16–24](../08/16.md)). Make sure that your translation includes these elements that encourage the Corinthians to give to the collection.\n\n### The generosity of the Macedonians\n\nIn [8:1–5](../08/01.md), Paul tells the Corinthians about how the Macedonian believers contributed generously to the collection even though they were poor and suffering. He does this to encourage the Corinthians also to give generously. While Paul does not directly compare how much the Corinthians and Macedonians have given, he does use the Macedonians as an example. Your translation should clearly present the Macedonians as an example to imitate.\n\n### Equality\n\nIn [8:13–14](../08/13.md), Paul indicates that one of the reasons for the collection is “equality” among believers. He does not mean that every believer must have exactly the same amount of possessions and money. What he does mean is that believers who have much should share with believers who have little. He wants all believers to be doing “equally” well. So, while this does not mean that everyone has exactly the same amount of possessions and money, it does mean that some believers should not be rich when others are poor. Consider how you might express the idea of general, although not exact, “equality.”\n\n### Titus and two traveling companions\n\nIn [8:16–23](../08/16.md), Paul commends Titus and then introduces and commends the two men who travel with him. Most likely, these three men traveled together and carried Paul’s letter (2 Corinthians) with them. Paul does not name the two men, but he does indicate that they are trustworthy and should be respected. If you have normal ways of introducing and commending people, you could use them here.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the words “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to himself and those who work with him. He does not include the Corinthians. You should assume that Paul only means himself and his fellow workers unless a note specifies otherwise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

8:3	tf8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ δύναμιν & παρὰ δύναμιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **ability**, you could express the same idea in another way.

8:4	jdqw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τὴν χάριν καὶ τὴν κοινωνίαν	1	The two words **favor** and **fellowship** work together to express a single idea.

8:4	nmw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς διακονίας τῆς εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους	1	Here Paul does not give very many details about the **ministry** because he had already told the Corinthians about it in [1 Corinthians 16:1–4](../1co/16/01.md).

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that this is what Paul is talking about.

Alternate translation: “and to us before they gave money”
8:5	m2mg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἡμῖν	1	Here Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

8:6	z42y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθὼς προενήρξατο	1	Here Paul could be implying that Titus already **began**: (1) the **grace**, which is collecting money for the believers in Jerusalem.

8:8	x7fs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἑτέρων	1	Paul is using the adjective **others** as a noun to mean other people, particularly other believers.

8:12	c50n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse ([8:11](../08/11.md)) about giving “from what you have.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation.

They did not have much food, so God miraculously made something like bread appear on the ground for them.

9:intro	lt8d				0	# 2 Corinthians 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Giving for the gospel (8:1–9:15)\n     * Paul appeals to the Corinthians to give generously (8:7–9:5)\n     * Blessing and thanksgiving (9:6–15)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse [9:9](../09/09.md), which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Plans for the collection\n\nIn [9:1–5](../09/01.md), Paul continues to speak about the collection for the Jerusalem believers, how the Corinthians should contribute to it, and why he is sending Titus and two other believers to the Corinthians. For more information, see the introduction to chapter 8.\n\n### God enables and blesses those who give\n\nIn [9:6–14](../09/06.md), Paul describes how God gives people enough money and possessions so that they can give to others, and he also describes how God blesses people who do this. Finally, he explains how giving and receiving gifts glorifies God. Your translation should not suggest that God makes people who give to others very rich. Instead of that, Paul is saying that God gives some people more than they need so that they can give what they have to fellow believers, which leads to thanksgiving and glory to God.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Farming metaphors\n\nIn [9:6](../09/06.md), [10](../09/10.md), Paul speaks of giving to fellow believers as if it were like farming. In [9:6](../09/06.md), Paul refers to how farmers who sow much seed will harvest more produce. This applies to believers giving to each other: those who give more will produce more blessings for others and glory to God. In [9:10](../09/10.md), Paul refers to how God is the one who provides the seeds and the produce for farmers. This again applies to believers giving to each other: God is the one who gives some believers more than they need so that they can share it with others, and God also makes those gifts bless others and glorify him. If possible, preserve these metaphors or express the ideas in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n

There are two things that Paul thinks are possibilities. First, **Macedonians** might travel with him. Second, the Corinthians might be **unprepared**. Paul wishes to say that if both these things were to happen, both he and the Corinthians would be **ashamed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces something that might happen. Alternate translation: “suppose that Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared; in that case” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
9:4	j8ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπαρασκευάστους	1	Here Paul implies that they would be **unprepared** to give money to the collection.

9:4	rz1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τῇ ὑποστάσει ταύτῃ	1	Here most ancient manuscripts read **this situation**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts read “this situation of boasting.” Most likely, the phrase “of boasting” was added by accident because it appears in the similar phrase in [11:17](../11/17.md). So, it is recommended that you use the reading of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
9:5	v9y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **So** introduces an inference or conclusion from what Paul said in the previous verse (see [9:5](../09/05.md)).

9:5	q1up		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	προέλθωσιν εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **go**. Alternate translation: “they should come to you beforehand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
9:5	p927		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὴν προεπηγγελμένην εὐλογίαν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “blessing that you promised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

9:5	zg4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	οὕτως ὡς	1	Here Paul uses both the phrase **in this way** and the word **as** to introduce the two ways in which the Corinthians could give to the collection. Your language may only use one form to introduce this information. If so, you could use just one form here. Alternate translation: “as” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
9:5	nm2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ ὡς πλεονεξίαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

9:6	lmv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section.

In the second clause, he uses the word **blessings** to show the Corinthians how to apply what he says about farmers to the collection. Just as farmers receive a harvest that fits with how they sowed, so people who give to help other believers will receive **blessings** that fit with what and how much they gave. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or clearly express how the metaphor relates to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “giving money to help other believers is like farming. The one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings” or “the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one sowing generously will also reap generously. Similarly, the one giving blessings to fellow believers will also receive blessings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “the one sowing sparingly will also reap sparingly; yes, the one sowing in blessings will also reap in blessings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
9:7	qrhq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	προῄρηται τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	Although the words **he** and **his** are masculine, Paul is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

9:7	tzt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by using plain language. Alternate translation: “in his mind” or “on his own” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:7	whg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ ἐκ λύπης ἢ ἐξ ἀνάγκης	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **sorrow** and **compulsion**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

9:13	z8k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἁπλότητι τῆς κοινωνίας	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **fellowship** that is characterized by **generosity**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use an adjective such as “generous.” Alternate translation: “the generous fellowship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
9:13	ll01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἁπλότητι τῆς κοινωνίας εἰς αὐτοὺς καὶ εἰς πάντας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **generosity** and **fellowship**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “how unselfishly you give to them and to everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
9:13	gyy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντας	1	Here, the word **everyone** refers primarily to believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “every believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:14	qea1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ αὐτῶν δεήσει ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, ἐπιποθούντων ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the phrase **in their prayer on your behalf** could go with: (1) **longing**. In this case, the word **longing** describes another thing that the Jerusalem believers do, besides “glorifying God” (see [9:13](../09/13.md)). Alternate translation: “and they are longing for you in their prayer on your behalf,” (2) the phrase “because of” in the previous verse (see [9:13](../09/13.md)). In this case, **their prayer on your behalf** is another reason why God receives glory. Alternate translation: “and because of their prayer on your behalf, in which they long for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
9:14	lwgq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιποθούντων	1	Here, the word **longing** could introduce: (1) the way in which they pray. Alternate translation: “in which they long” (2) why they pray. Alternate translation: “since they long” (3) something they do along with praying. Alternate translation: “and they long” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:14	alzd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ὑπερβάλλουσαν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐφ’ ὑμῖν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **grace** that is connected to **God**. He could mean that the **grace**: (1) is something that **God** gave to them to do. Alternate translation: “how God has given you the ability to perform surpassing grace” (2) is how God has acted towards them. Alternate translation: “how God has been surpassingly gracious to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
9:14	vytr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ὑπερβάλλουσαν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐφ’ ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how very kind God has been to you” or “what God has graciously enabled you to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
9:15	sxtg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	χάρις τῷ Θεῷ	1	Here, **Thanks {be} to God** is an exclamatory phrase that communicates Paul’s thankfulness. Use an exclamation form that is natural in your language for communicating thanks. See how you translated the similar phrase in [8:16](../08/16.md). Alternate translation: “we give thanks to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
9:15	es8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἐπὶ τῇ ἀνεκδιηγήτῳ αὐτοῦ δωρεᾷ	1	Here Paul does not clarify exactly what this **gift** is. He could mean the way in which the Corinthians give, which leads to a close connection between believers and glory to God. He could mean Jesus himself, whom God gave. In this case, use a general expression for a gift, since Paul does not clarify exactly what **gift** he means. Alternate translation: “for what he has given us, which is indescribable” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
10:intro	abcd				0	# 2 Corinthians 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Paul defends his apostolic authority (10:1–13:10)\n     * The true standard for boasting (10:1–18)\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words in [10:17](../10/17.md), which are from [Jeremiah 9:24](../jer/09/24.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Paul’s opponents\n\nIn this and the following chapters, Paul defends himself and his authority against people who said that they were better than Paul and that the Corinthians should listen to them instead of to Paul. These people either lived in or were visiting Corinth. Paul does not state who these people are or refer to them directly. However, he does refer indirectly to what people are saying about him. Consider whether your readers would notice and understand Paul’s indirect references to his opponents. If not, you may need to make some of his references more explicit. See the notes for specific issues and translation options.\n\n### Accusations against Paul\n\nIn [10:1](../10/01.md), [10](../10/10.md), Paul states that some people think that he is meek and gentle in person but bold and forceful when he is away from them. In [10:7](../10/07.md), Paul hints that his opponents might say that they are “of Christ” but that Paul and his fellow workers are not. It is very likely that Paul knew more things that people said about him, but he does not state anything more directly. Make sure that your translation shows that Paul knew that people were saying at least these two things about him.\n\n### Boasting\n\nIn [10:8](../10/08.md), [13](../10/13.md), [15–17](../10/15.md), Paul speaks about boasting. In Paul’s culture, not all boasting was considered bad. Instead, there were good and bad kinds of boasting. In these verses, Paul explains what counts as good boasting, and he explains that he boasts in a good way. He also implies that his opponents boast in a bad way. You should use a word or phrase that refers to saying that someone or something is great, and make sure that this word or phrase could refer to something good or to something bad. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/boast]])\n\n### Measuring, measures, and limits\n\nIn [10:12–16](../10/12.md), Paul speaks about “measures” and “limits.” He is referring to standards with which people compare themselves and rules according to which people act. He argues that he and his fellow workers have compared themselves to a standard that God has provided and work according to rules that God gave. He suggests that his opponents compare themselves to standards they have invented and do not follow the rules that God has given. Further, Paul argues that the rules God gave to him and those with him require them to be the ones who teach the Corinthians. Consider what words and phrases would express these ideas clearly in your language.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Ironic speech\n\nIn [10:1](../10/01.md), Paul describes himself as “meek” when he is with the Corinthians but “bold” when he is away from them. He is speaking ironically, that is, describing himself as his opponents do when he does not really believe it. This is clear from [10:10](../10/10.md), where Paul states that this opinion comes from others, not from himself. Further, it is possible that what Paul says in [10:10](../10/10.md) is also ironic speech: “we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of the ones commending themselves.” It is likely, however, that Paul actually means this and is not speaking from another person’s perspective. Consider a natural way to express the ironic speech in [10:1](../10/01.md) so that your readers know that Paul is speaking from the perspective of his opponents.\n\n### War metaphor\n\nIn verses [10:3–6](../10/03.md), Paul speaks of preaching the gospel and opposing God’s enemies as if he and his fellow workers were fighting a war. While he and those with him do not try to kill their enemies, he does mean that they fight and struggle very hard. If possible, preserve this metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Exclusive “we”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul uses the words “we,” “us,” and “our” to refer to himself and those who work with him. He does not include the Corinthians. You should assume that Paul only means himself and his fellow workers unless a note specifies otherwise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### The word for “limit” and “area”\n\nThe word translated “limit” in [10:13](../10/13.md), [15](../10/15.md) and “area” in [10:16](../10/16.md) most generally refers to a straight stick that could be used for measuring things. In these verses, it could refer primarily to the standard by which things are measured or to the things that are measured. If the word refers to the standard by which things are measured, it refers primarily to what God has called Paul and his fellow workers to do. The UST generally follows this interpretation. If the word refers to the things that are measured, it refers primarily to the people or areas in which God has called Paul and his fellow workers to preach the gospel. The ULT generally follows this interpretation. Before you translate these verses, you should read [10:13–16](../10/13.md) and consider which interpretation best fits with what Paul is arguing.
10:1	yc1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	αὐτὸς δὲ ἐγὼ, Παῦλος	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new topic, which Paul introduces with several strong words. This new topic concerns Paul himself and his ministry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces a new topic and focuses on Paul himself. Alternate translation: “As for me, Paul, I” or “Concerning me, Paul, I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
10:1	rf4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ὃς κατὰ πρόσωπον μὲν ταπεινὸς ἐν ὑμῖν, ἀπὼν δὲ θαρρῶ εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul describes himself with words that the Corinthians or his enemies use. He does not mean that he thinks these words are actually true about himself, but he repeats them to respond to what others are saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that these are words that other people have said about Paul. Alternate translation: “who appears to be meek when face to face among you, but being absent, appears to be bold toward you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
10:1	w8g1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ πρόσωπον	1	Here, the phrase **face to face** refers to being with someone physically or in person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “when physically present” or “when bodily” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:1	aqbi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τῆς πραΰτητος καὶ ἐπιεικείας	1	The terms **meekness** and **gentleness** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the gentleness” or “the humility” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
10:1	gq7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς πραΰτητος καὶ ἐπιεικείας τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **meekness** and **gentleness**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “by how meek and gentle Christ was” or “by how meekly and gently Christ acted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:1	jz4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	διὰ τῆς πραΰτητος καὶ ἐπιεικείας τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to identify the **meekness** and **gentleness** that characterized **Christ**. He could mean that: (1) he is appealing to them with the same **meekness** and **gentleness** that Christ showed. Alternate translation: “in the meek and gentle manner that Christ had” (2) he wants them to consider the **meekness** and **gentleness** that Christ had when they listen to his appeal. Alternate translation: “asking that you think about the meekness and gentleness that Christ had” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
10:2	s6iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development, or you could leave **Now** untranslated.

10:2	f8dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	μὴ & θαρρῆσαι τῇ πεποιθήσει ᾗ	1	Here Paul includes both the action of being **bold** and the **confidence** with which he performs the action. He includes both of these elements because it makes the statement stronger. If your readers would find the repetition confusing, or if the repetition does not make the statement stronger, you could use just one of the terms and make the statement strong in another way. Alternate translation: “I will not need to be very bold, which is how” or “I will not need to have the great confidence with which” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
10:2	k6mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πεποιθήσει ᾗ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **confidence**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and confident in the way that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:2	e6lq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τολμῆσαι	1	Here Paul implies that he will be **courageous** as he argues against or defends himself against the people who are saying bad things about him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to be courageous when I argue” or “to courageously defend myself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:2	ik1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τινας τοὺς λογιζομένους	1	Here Paul refers to people who are often called “the opponents.” It is not clear whether these people are some of the Corinthians or whether they have visited the Corinthians. What is clear is that they are saying bad things about Paul and claiming to have greater authority and a better gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “our opponents who regard” or “any people who regard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:2	i6hh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	περιπατοῦντας	1	Paul uses the term **walking** to speak of behavior in life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “acting” or “living our lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:2	t6lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	1	Here Paul uses the phrase **according to the flesh** to refer to human ways of thinking and acting. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to human values or perspectives. Alternate translation: “according to what humans value” or “according to a human perspective” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:3	i2p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse ([10:2](../10/02.md)) about how some people think that he and his fellow workers walk according to the flesh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed, though” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
10:3	cvd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	περιπατοῦντες	1	You should translate **walking** as you did in [10:2](../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “acting” or “living our lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:3	zbet		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν σαρκὶ	1	Here, the phrase **in the flesh** indicates that Paul and his fellow workers are humans like everyone else. He is contrasting his humanity with how he wages war, which is not the way in which most humans wage war. If possible, express this idea so that it is clearly connected to how you translate **according to the flesh**. Alternate translation: “in human lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:3	k7h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	οὐ & στρατευόμεθα	1	Here and in [10:4–6](../10/04.md), Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers were waging a **war**. He means that they proclaim the good news and defend it and other believers against people and powers that try to corrupt the good news and hurt believers. Paul does not mean that they are actually killing people or fighting with physical weapons. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “we are like people who wage war, but not” or “we do not fight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
10:3	gpd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	1	You should translate this phrase as you did in [10:2](../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “according to what humans value” or “according to a human perspective” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:4	ge87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse ([10:3](../10/03.md)) about waging war not according to the flesh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
10:4	uf5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	τὰ & ὅπλα τῆς στρατείας ἡμῶν οὐ σαρκικὰ, ἀλλὰ δυνατὰ τῷ Θεῷ πρὸς καθαίρεσιν ὀχυρωμάτων, λογισμοὺς καθαιροῦντες	1	Here, just as in [10:3](../10/03.md), Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers were involved in **warfare**. In this verse, he specifically speaks about their **weapons** and about their enemies’ **strongholds**. He defines the **strongholds** as **strategies** or arguments against him and the gospel. Paul means by this that God empowers him and his fellow workers to prove that these arguments are false. Paul does not mean that they are physically fighting against people or destroying physical strongholds. Preserve the metaphor if it is clear in your language or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “what we use to defend ourselves are like weapons of warfare that are not fleshly but are powerful to God for overcoming strategies and arguments, which are like strongholds” or “we do not fight with fleshly weapons but with arguments that are powerful to God for the defeating of powerful enemies and strategies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
10:4	d1gj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ & ὅπλα τῆς στρατείας ἡμῶν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **weapons** that are used to fight in **warfare**.

10:4	ohuj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς στρατείας ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **warfare**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “with which we fight” or “we use to wage war” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])\n
10:4	rk8i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σαρκικὰ	1	Here, **fleshly** represents what is natural and human as opposed to what is spiritual and godly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “not according to natural human wisdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:4	cluj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δυνατὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Here, the phrase **powerful to God** indicates that the weapons are **powerful** because God makes them powerful. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “are made powerful by God” or “have God’s power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:4	ztdd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πρὸς καθαίρεσιν ὀχυρωμάτων, λογισμοὺς καθαιροῦντες,	1	The phrases **the tearing down of strongholds** and **tearing down strategies** mean similar things. Paul is using the two phrases together for emphasis, with the the second phrase defining the first phrase. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “for the tearing down of powerful strategies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
10:5	xuz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	καὶ πᾶν ὕψωμα ἐπαιρόμενον κατὰ τῆς γνώσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ αἰχμαλωτίζοντες πᾶν νόημα εἰς τὴν ὑπακοὴν τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, just as in [10:3–4](../10/03.md), Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers were involved in a war. In this verse, he speaks about **every high thing**, which are fortifications or walls. He means that he and his fellow workers defeat or discredit anything that claims to be as great or important as **the knowledge of God**. Paul also speaks about taking thoughts **captive**. Just as the victor in a war takes the conquered people **captive**, so Paul and his fellow workers wish to take peoples’ thoughts **captive** so that these people are obedient to Christ. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “and anything that is like a high fortress that raises itself against the knowledge of God, and we control every thought like we we were taking it captive into the obedience of Christ” or “and anything that proudly claims to be more important than the knowledge of God, and we take control of every thought into the obedience of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
10:5	b74d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς γνώσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **knowledge** that is about **God**.

10:5	vm1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς γνώσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “knowing God” or “what we know about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:5	j6ra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πᾶν νόημα	1	Here, the phrase **every thought** could refer to: (1) the thoughts had by people who oppose the gospel. Alternate translation: “every thought of people who oppose the gospel” (2) the thoughts had by believers. Alternate translation: “every thought of believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:5	z7ji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ὑπακοὴν τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **obedience** that is directed to **Christ**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a more natural form. Alternate translation: “obedience to Christ” or “obedience directed to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
10:5	r2yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν ὑπακοὴν τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **obedience**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “so that Christ is obeyed” or “so that people are obedient to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:6	g9z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	καὶ ἐν ἑτοίμῳ ἔχοντες, ἐκδικῆσαι πᾶσαν παρακοήν, ὅταν πληρωθῇ ὑμῶν ἡ ὑπακοή	1	Here Paul finishes speaking as if he and his fellow workers were involved in a war. Here he says that they are **in readiness**, like soldiers ready to attack. When they attack, they will **avenge every act of disobedience**. What he means is that, once people are captive to the “obedience of Christ,” he and his fellow workers will punish them if they go back to being disobedient. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. Alternate translation: “and being like soldiers who are ready to avenge every act of disobedience, when your obedience would be complete” or “and being prepared to punish everyone who disobeys, when your obedience would be complete” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
10:6	j0bh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἑτοίμῳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **readiness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “prepared” or “ready” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:6	m4ds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσαν παρακοήν, ὅταν πληρωθῇ ὑμῶν ἡ ὑπακοή	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **disobedience** and **obedience**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “every disobedient act, when you have completed being obedient” or “all the ways that people disobey, when you have completed obeying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:6	bgwq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμῶν ἡ ὑπακοή	1	Here, the word **obedience** could refer to being obedient: (1) to Christ. This option is supported by the phrase “the obedience of Christ” in [10:5](../10/05.md). Alternate translation: “your obedience to Christ” (2) to Paul. Alternate translation: “your obedience to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:6	ipsn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πληρωθῇ ὑμῶν ἡ ὑπακοή	1	Here Paul is referring to how he wants the Corinthians to commit to obeying. When they always work towards **obedience**, then he and his fellow workers will **avenge every act of disobedience**. He does not mean that the Corinthians need to be perfectly obedient or **complete** specific acts of obedience. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “you fully work to obey” or “you completely strive for obedience” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:7	y2yb			τὰ κατὰ πρόσωπον βλέπετε	1	This sentence could be: (1) a command to look at what is obvious. Alternate translation: “You should look at the things according to appearance” (2) a rebuke concerning how they only look at how things appear. Alternate translation: “You are looking at the things according to appearance”
10:7	gsvr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ πρόσωπον	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **appearance**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as they appear” or “according to how they appear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Paul defends his apostolic authority (10:1–13:10)\n     * Paul defends his speech and conduct (11:1–15)\n     * Paul boasts about his suffering (11:16–33)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Fools and foolishness\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul refers to being “foolish” or a “fool.” These words refer to a person who makes bad decisions and who cares about things that are not really valuable. It does not primarily refer to someone who does not know very much. Paul argues that the false teachers are “fools,” which means that they make bad decisions and care about things that are not important. He also describes how he is responding to the false teachers as “foolish.” He means that he speaks in ways that he considers to be “foolish,” but he speaks in these ways because he thinks the Corinthians will understand him if he speaks in these “foolish” ways. Consider how you might express the idea of “foolishness” in your language. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])\n\n### False teachers\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul is defending himself against false teachers who were claiming to be better than him and to preach a better gospel than his gospel. Paul never refers to these false teachers by name, but he does call them “false apostles” and “deceitful” (see [11:13](../11/13.md)). He also responds to some of their claims about themselves in [11:22–23](../11/22.md). Paul responds to the false teachers in two primary ways. First, he argues that the things that they boast about and claim for themselves are not important or valuable. Second, he argues that even in these things that are not important, he is better than they are. Make sure that your translation clearly indicates that Paul is responding the false teachers in these ways.\n\n### Financial support for teachers\n\nIn this chapter, Paul describes how he did not ask for or receive money and support from the Corinthians. In Paul’s culture, it was common for traveling teachers to ask for and receive money from the people they were teaching. Paul implies that his opponents, the false teachers, did ask for and receive money. He also implies that the Corinthians thought that the message of the false teachers was more valuable than Paul’s message because they charged money for their teaching. Paul argues in response that he cares more for the Corinthians than the false teachers do. In fact, he states that he can boast more than the false teachers because he did not receive money. Make sure that your translation expresses and implies these ideas.\n\n### Boasting\n\nJust as in the previous chapter, in this chapter Paul refers multiple times to “boasting.” In Paul’s culture, not all boasting was considered bad. Instead, there were good and bad kinds of boasting. In these verses, Paul boasts because his opponents, the false teachers, boast. He does not think that this boasting is necessary or good, but he does it to respond to his opponents. Continue to express the idea as you did in the previous chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/boast]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Marriage metaphor\n\nIn [11:2](../11/02.md), Paul speaks as if the Corinthians were a young woman and as if he were the young woman’s father. He intends to marry his daughter to Christ, and he wants to keep his daughter pure and perfect until then. He means that he has helped unite the Corinthians to Christ, and he wants to make sure they stay completely faithful to Christ until Christ comes back. If possible, preserve the marriage metaphor or express it as a simile. See the notes on [11:2](../11/02.md) for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Irony\n\nMultiple times in this chapter, Paul uses irony. In other words, he speaks words that he does not agree with in order to make a point. He does this in [11:5](../11/05.md), where he refers to “super-apostles”; in [11:8](../11/08.md), where he says that he “robbed other churches”; in [11:19](../11/19.md), where he says that the Corinthians gladly bear with the foolish, being wise; and in [11:21](../11/21.md), where he says that he speaks according to dishonor that he and his fellow workers have been weak. In each of these verses, he does not actually agree with these words. Rather, he speaks from the perspective of the Corinthians or his opponents. He does this to show that these perspectives are wrong. See the notes on each of these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [11:7](../11/07.md), [11](../11/11.md), [22–23](../11/22.md), [29](../11/29.md), Paul uses rhetorical questions. Paul asks these questions to include the Corinthians in what he is arguing, not because he is looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions or you could express them as statements or exclamations. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The long list in [11:23–28](../11/23.md)\n\nIn [11:23–28](../11/23.md), Paul gives a long list of hardships and difficulties he has experienced while he preached the good news. The ULT and UST illustrate different ways to break this list up into pieces. Consider how you might naturally express a long list in your language. 
11:1	r4q6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μικρόν τι ἀφροσύνης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **foolishness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as I act a little foolishly” or “as I now say what is foolish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
11:1	b4dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μικρόν τι ἀφροσύνης	1	Here, the **foolishness** that Paul refers to is how he is about to boast about his qualifications as an apostle. Paul considers this to be **foolishness**, but he will boast anyways to help the Corinthians realize that he and the gospel that he preaches come from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **foolishness** refers to more explicit. Alternate translation: “as I am about to be a little bit foolish” or “in a little bit of foolishness that I am about to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:1	sou7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀνέχεσθέ μου	1	Here, this clause could be: (1) a statement of what the Corinthians are already doing, either as they listen to this letter or in the past when Paul visited them. Alternate translation: “but in fact you are already bearing with me” (2) a command to act in this way. Alternate translation: “and in fact you need to bear with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:2	yozf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) the reason why Paul will be a little foolish. Alternate translation: “I will be a little bit foolish since” (2) the reason why the Corinthians should bear with Paul. Alternate translation: “I want you to bear with me because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
11:2	ubnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεοῦ ζήλῳ	1	Here, the phrase **godly jealousy** could refer to **jealousy**: (1) that is the same **jealousy** that God has. Alternate translation: “with the jealousy that God has” (2) that is from God. Alternate translation: “with jealousy from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:2	m6vl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Θεοῦ ζήλῳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **jealousy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in a godly way” or “as God is jealous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
11:2	ee9i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡρμοσάμην γὰρ ὑμᾶς ἑνὶ ἀνδρὶ, παρθένον ἁγνὴν παραστῆσαι τῷ Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul speaks as if he is the father of the Corinthians, who together are his daughter. Paul has promised to give his daughter (the Corinthians) as a wife to a man, who is **Christ**. Until that marriage happens, Paul the father must make sure that his daughter (the Corinthians) remains a **pure virgin**. If these customs are somewhat similar to what happens in your culture, you could preserve the metaphor or express the idea with a simile. If these customs are not similar to what happens in your culture, you could explain the ideas more clearly or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “for I am like your father who has betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to be married to Christ” or “I helped you believe in the Messiah, and I will work hard to help you remain faithful to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:3	ddrl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς ὁ ὄφις ἐξηπάτησεν Εὕαν ἐν τῇ πανουργίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul refers to a story in [Genesis 3:1–7](../gen/03/01.md). In this story, a **serpent**, whom Paul would have identified as Satan, deceives **Eve**, the first woman, into eating a fruit that God told her not to eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit or include a footnote that explains the story. Alternate translation: “as the serpent, Satan, by his craftiness deceived the first woman, Eve, into disobeying God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:3	l2hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ πανουργίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **craftiness**, you could express the same idea in another way.

11:3	m5zn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φθαρῇ τὰ νοήματα ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “people might corrupt your minds” or “some person might corrupt your minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
11:3	ufsj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τῆς ἁπλότητος καὶ τῆς ἁγνότητος	1	The terms **sincerity** and **purity** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “full sincerity” or “complete purity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
11:3	sgml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ τῆς ἁπλότητος καὶ τῆς ἁγνότητος τῆς εἰς τὸν Χριστόν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **sincerity** and **purity**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “from how sincere and pure you are to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
11:3	gl9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς εἰς τὸν Χριστόν	1	Here, the phrase **{that are} to Christ** indicates that the **sincerity** and **purity** are directed towards **Christ**. In other words, the Corinthians think with **sincerity** and **purity** in their devotion or loyalty **to Christ**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “that you have for Christ” or “in your faith in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n
11:4	wq57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce a reason why: (1) Paul is afraid that someone will corrupt the Corinthians (see [11:3](../11/03.md)). Alternate translation: “I am afraid of that because” (2) the Corinthians should “bear with” Paul (see [11:1](../11/01.md)), which is that they “bear with” these false teachers. Alternate translation: “You should bear with me because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
11:4	era4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ μὲν & ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	Here Paul is speaking as if **one coming** to the Corinthians and proclaiming **another Jesus** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it had already or will actually happen. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “when.” Alternate translation: “when indeed one coming” or “indeed whenever someone comes and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
11:4	zj79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	Here Paul could be referring to: (1) any person or group of people. Alternate translation: “anyone coming” or “any person coming” (2) a specific person whom Paul knows about.

11:4	l7m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πνεῦμα ἕτερον	1	Here, the phrase **a different spirit** could refer to: (1) an evil **spirit** in contrast to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “a spirit different than the Holy Spirit” (2) an attitude in contrast to the attitude that Paul and his fellow workers offered to the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “a different mindset” or “a different attitude” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:4	fs5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καλῶς ἀνέχεσθε	1	See how you translated the similar phrase in [11:1](../11/01.md). Here Paul means that the Corinthians listen patiently even when false teachers are telling them lies. He does not approve of this behavior, but he uses this clause to link what he is saying here with what he said in [11:1](../11/01.md). Alternate translation: “you willingly put up with it” or “you listen attentively to it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:5	l3on		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) a reason why what Paul told them about Jesus, the Spirit, and the gospel (see [11:4](../11/04.md)) takes priority over what anyone else tells them. Alternate translation: “So, what I taught you has priority, since” (2) a reason why they should “bear with” Paul (see [11:1](../11/01.md)).

11:5	ptd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑστερηκέναι τῶν ὑπέρλίαν ἀποστόλων	1	Here Paul speaks as if he is not below or **short of** the **“super-apostles”**. He means that he does not have less power and authority than they do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “to be less than the ‘super-apostles’” or “to have less authority than the ‘super-apostles’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:5	eet1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τῶν ὑπέρλίαν ἀποστόλων	1	Here Paul refers to his opponents, the false teachers, with the words that they themselves or their followers used to describe them: **“super-apostles”**. He does not actually believe that these people are better **apostles** or greater than anyone else. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is speaking from someone else’s perspective to make a point. Alternate translation: “of the so-called ‘super-apostles’” or “of those who consider themselves super-apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
11:6	v1o7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a development of the ideas from the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a development, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

11:6	berv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ γνώσει	1	Here, the word **knowledge** refers to what a person knows about Jesus and the good news about him.

Alternate translation: “in every way … among all people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:6	bb1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φανερώσαντες	1	Here Paul implies that what he makes **clear** is that he has **knowledge**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having made the fact that I have knowledge clear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:7	nrmw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἢ	1	The word **Or** introduces an alternate to what Paul said in the previous verse, where he stated that he has “knowledge” (see [11:6](../11/06.md)). With **Or**, then, Paul introduces a question that raises another possible objection to his authority as an apostle: he did not charge them money for teaching them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Or** with a word that signifies a contrast or gives an alternative. Alternate translation: “But” or “However,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
11:7	un9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ ἁμαρτίαν ἐποίησα ἐμαυτὸν ταπεινῶν, ἵνα ὑμεῖς ὑψωθῆτε, ὅτι δωρεὰν τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ εὐαγγέλιον εὐηγγελισάμην ὑμῖν?	1	Paul is using the question form to show the Corinthians that he did not **commit a sin**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But I certainly did not commit a sin, humbling myself so that you yourselves might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without payment!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
11:7	azyr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐμαυτὸν ταπεινῶν	1	Here Paul refers to how he worked to make money for himself. In his culture, this was **humbling**, since good speakers and teachers would not need to do extra work, because they would make enough money from the people they taught. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “humbling myself by supporting myself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:7	yrqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑμεῖς ὑψωθῆτε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

11:8	k6ds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἄλλας ἐκκλησίας ἐσύλησα	1	Here Paul refers to receiving money from **other churches** to support himself as he served the Corinthians as if it were robbery. He means that he received money from these churches and did not give them anything in return, which some people would consider robbery. He uses this strong language to indicate how much he and the **other churches** sacrificed to help the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly indicates that Paul is speaking from another person’s perspective and overstating what he means. Alternate translation: “It was as if I robbed other churches” or “Some might say that I robbed other churches” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
11:8	jqsv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λαβὼν ὀψώνιον πρὸς τὴν ὑμῶν διακονίαν	1	Here Paul implies that the **other churches** paid him a **wage**, but so that he could serve the Corinthians, not them.

11:9	qj8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ κατενάρκησα	1	Here Paul speaks of asking for money as if it were a heavy **burden** that he would have asked the Corinthians to carry for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. Alternate translation: “I did not trouble” or “I did not ask for money and so harass” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:9	a23k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul may not only be referring to men. It is possible that he is referring only to men, but he may also include women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “the siblings” or “the brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
11:9	kp9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith.

11:9	sqcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐτήρησα καὶ τηρήσω	1	Here Paul is indicating that he was not a **burden** to them when he visited them in the past, and he promises that he will never be a **burden** to them in the future. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that expresses this idea clearly. Alternate translation: “I have kept and will always keep” or “in the past I kept and in the future will keep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:10	fohm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	ἔστιν ἀλήθεια Χριστοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ, ὅτι	1	The phrase **The truth of Christ is in me** is an oath formula that Paul uses to show that what he is about to say is true. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. Alternate translation: “As the truth of Christ is in me,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula]])
11:10	si2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἔστιν ἀλήθεια Χριστοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ	1	Here Paul could be using the possessive form to indicate that: (1) he is truthful like **Christ** was truthful.

11:10	mth0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔστιν ἀλήθεια Χριστοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I am as truthful as the Messiah is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
11:10	t4tt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ καύχησις αὕτη	1	Here Paul refers to how he boasts about not accepting money from the Corinthians when he told them about the good news. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “this boasting about how I have not burdened you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:10	n60n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ φραγήσεται εἰς ἐμὲ	1	Here Paul speaks as if his **boasting** were a door that **will not be shut to** him. He means that no one will be able to keep him from boasting or prove that what he says is not true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “of mine will not be stifled” or “will not be proved wrong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:10	nae3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ καύχησις αὕτη οὐ φραγήσεται εἰς ἐμὲ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

11:31	gb7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἶδεν	1	Here Paul states that God **knows** that Paul is **not lying**.

12:intro	abcf				0	# 2 Corinthians 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Paul defends his apostolic authority (10:1–13:10)\n     * Paul’s ascent to heaven and the thorn in the flesh (12:1–10)\n     * Paul concludes his boasting (12:11–13)\n     * Paul defends his financial conduct (12:14–18)\n     * Paul warns the Corinthians about his third visit (12:19–13:10)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Paul’s trip to heaven\n\nIn [12:1–6](../12/01.md), Paul speaks about how he temporarily ascended to heaven 14 years before he wrote this letter. He speaks about this experience in the third person to avoid directly boasting about himself. Also, he gives very few details about his experience. He describes how he went to the third heaven and paradise, that he heard words he cannot tell to others, and that he is not sure whether he ascended in his body or without his body (which would be either spiritually or in a dream). Paul gives enough details to show that he really did ascend to heaven, but he does not want to tell the Corinthians about what he learned and saw there. In other words, he only “boasts” about this experience to show the Corinthians that he is truly an apostle even according to their standards. However, he thinks it is better to boast about how Christ works through him when he is weak, which is Christ’s standard for being an apostle.\n\n### The third heaven and Paradise\n\nIn Paul’s culture, many people believed that there were different levels or layers in heaven, but they disagreed on how many levels or layers there were. Some people thought that there was only one layer, while others thought that there were three, five, seven, or ten layers. Because of the various options, we cannot be sure whether the “third heaven” is the highest heaven or whether it is the third out of more layers of heaven. When Paul uses the word “Paradise,” he is most likely referring to the place where believers go after they die and before they resurrect. The way he refers to Paradise could imply either that it is the third heaven or that it is part of the third heaven. However, we cannot be sure about this either. Since we do not know Paul’s view about the layers of heaven or about the location of Paradise, it is best not to include any implied information on these issues in your translation.\n\n### The thorn in the flesh\n\nIn [12:7–8](../12/07.md), Paul refers to a “thorn in the flesh” that was given to him. He further names this “thorn” as a “messenger of Satan.” There are three primary possibilities for what the thorn could be. First, it could be some kind of sickness, disease, or ailment. Second, it could be opposition from other people who wish to stop Paul from preaching the gospel. Third, it could a demon who tries to keep Paul from serving Christ. However, since we do not know anything else about this “thorn,” it is impossible to identify exactly what Paul is writing about. What is clear is that the “thorn” makes Paul’s life difficult and painful. Your translation should be general enough to allow for all of these interpretations since Paul’s language is also this general.\n\n### Financial support for teachers\n\nIn this chapter, Paul continues to state that he did not and will not ask for or receive money and support from the Corinthians. In Paul’s culture, it was common for traveling teachers to ask for and receive money from the people they were teaching, and Paul’s opponents apparently did so. Paul, however, does not do so, and he explains further in this chapter why he acts in that way. Continue to express the idea as you did in the previous chapter.\n\n### Boasting\n\nJust as in the previous two chapters, in this chapter Paul refers multiple times to boasting. In Paul’s culture, not all boasting was considered bad. Instead, there were good and bad kinds of boasting. In these verses, Paul boasts because his opponents, the false teachers, boast. He does not think that this boasting is necessary or good, but he does it to respond to his opponents. Continue to express the idea as you did in the previous chapters. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/boast]])\n\n### Paul’s third visit\n\nIn [12:14](../12/14.md) and in [12:20–21](../12/20.md), Paul refers to visiting the Corinthians for a third time. He had only visited them twice by the time he wrote this letter, but he plans to visit them again. This visit would happen sometime after the Corinthians received this letter. We do know that Paul visited the Corinthians again because he wrote a later letter, Romans, from the city of Corinth.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [12:13](../12/13.md), [15](../12/15.md), [17–19](../12/17.md), Paul uses rhetorical questions. Paul asks these questions to include the Corinthians in what he is arguing, not because he is looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions, or you could express them as statements or exclamations. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Irony\n\nMultiple times in this chapter, Paul uses irony. In other words, he speaks words that he does not agree with in order to make a point. In [12:11](../12/11.md), he uses irony when he refers to the false teachers as “super-apostles.” He uses irony again in [12:13](../12/13.md), where he exclaims, “Forgive me this injustice!” He uses irony again in [12:16](../12/16.md), where he says, “I myself did not burden you, but, being crafty, I caught you by deceit.” In each of these verses, he does not actually agree with these words. Rather, he speaks from the perspective of the Corinthians or his opponents. He does this to show that these perspectives are wrong. See the notes on each of these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paul uses the third person to speak about himself\n\nIn [12:2–5](../12/02.md), Paul speaks about a person whom he knows. This person ascended into heaven and heard amazing things. However, in [12:6–7](../12/06.md), Paul speaks as if these “revelations” were things he himself had experienced. Paul must have been speaking about himself when he referred to a person he knows. Most likely, he does this to avoid directly boasting about himself (see [12:5–6](../12/05.md)). He would rather boast about how Christ gives him power when he is weak. If possible, preserve how Paul speaks about himself in the third person. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
12:1	e7q7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καυχᾶσθαι & οὐ συμφέρον μέν & δὲ	1	Here, the phrase **not profitable** could go with: (1) **I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord**. Alternate translation: “to boast: even though it is not profitable,” (2) **It is necessary to boast**. Alternate translation: “to boast, though it is not profitable. But” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:1	iur3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐλεύσομαι & εἰς	1	Here Paul speaks of moving on to a new topic as if he were physically moving to a new location. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. Alternate translation: “I will now speak about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:1	iwn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὀπτασίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεις	1	The terms **visions** and **revelations** mean similar things. It is possible that **visions** refers to experiences in which someone sees amazing things, while **revelations** refers to experiences in which someone learns amazing things in general. Paul uses both words to refer in general to all these kinds of experiences. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express Paul’s general focus with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “revelations” or “various visions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
12:1	rb42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὀπτασίας καὶ ἀποκαλύψεις Κυρίου	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **visions and revelations** that could: (1) come from **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “visions and revelations from the Lord” (2) be about **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “visions and revelations about the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
12:2	n5hz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οἶδα ἄνθρωπον ἐν Χριστῷ πρὸ ἐτῶν δεκατεσσάρων (εἴτε ἐν σώματι οὐκ οἶδα, εἴτε ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα, ὁ Θεὸς οἶδεν), ἁρπαγέντα τὸν τοιοῦτον ἕως τρίτου οὐρανοῦ	1	Here, the clauses **whether in the body, I do not know, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows** interrupt the sentence to indicate that Paul does not know exactly what form the ascent into heaven took. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move these clauses to wherever they would naturally appear in your language. Alternate translation: “Whether this happened in the body, I do not know, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows. However it happened, I know about a man in Christ who was caught up to the third heaven 14 years ago” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:2	cz7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	οἶδα ἄνθρωπον ἐν Χριστῷ πρὸ ἐτῶν δεκατεσσάρων & ἁρπαγέντα τὸν τοιοῦτον ἕως τρίτου οὐρανοῦ	1	In [12:2–5](../12/02.md), Paul uses the third person to speak about a person who traveled to the **third heaven**. It is clear from [12:6–7](../12/06.md) that he is actually speaking about himself. So, Paul uses the third person to avoid boasting directly about himself. If possible, use the third person in [12:2–5](../12/02.md) and reveal later that Paul himself is this **man**. If necessary, you could reveal in this verse that Paul is speaking about himself. Make sure your translation here fits with how you translate [12:3–5](../12/03.md). Alternate translation: “I know a man in Christ … such a man having been caught up to the third heaven 14 years ago. That man is me.” or “I know a man in Christ, that is, me … I was caught up to the third heaven 14 years ago” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
12:2	fawy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἄνθρωπον ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, indicates that the **man** believes in Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to a believer or Christian. Alternate translation: “man united to Christ” or “a believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:2	fth2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴτε ἐν σώματι οὐκ οἶδα, εἴτε ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα	1	Here Paul refers to a common question related to stories about people traveling to heaven: in what way does the person ascend into heaven? There were three primary ways a person could ascend: they could go into heaven physically in their body, they could go into heaven in a dream, or they could go into heaven with only their non-physical part, that is, their spirit. Here Paul indicates that he does not know in what way the **man in Christ** ascended into heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “whether in bodily form, I do not know, or not in bodily form, I do not know” or “whether physically, I do not know, or spiritually, I do not know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:2	da25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	εἴτε ἐν σώματι οὐκ οἶδα, εἴτε ἐκτὸς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα	1	Here Paul repeats **I do not know** in order to emphasize his lack of knowledge. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “whether in the body or out of the body, I certainly do not know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
12:2	dg7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἁρπαγέντα τὸν τοιοῦτον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, Paul implies that it was God. Alternate translation: “God having caught up such a man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:2	k4aw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως τρίτου οὐρανοῦ	1	Many people in Paul’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. Here, Paul refers to the **third heaven**. Since he does not specify how many heavens he thinks there are, it is best not to clarify whether this is the highest heaven or not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers more clearly to the **third** out of multiple heavens. Alternate translation: “up to the third out of multiple heavens” or “into the third sphere of heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:3	notz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **And** introduces a restatement of the previous verse with some new information. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a restatement. Alternate translation: “I repeat,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
12:3	idrl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ οἶδα τὸν τοιοῦτον ἄνθρωπον (εἴτε ἐν σώματι εἴτε χωρὶς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα, ὁ Θεὸς οἶδεν),	1	Just as in the previous verse, the clauses **whether in body, or out of the body, I do not know, God knows** interrupt the main sentence, which continues into the next verse. Use the same form you used in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Whether this happened in the body or out of the body, I do not know, God knows. However it happened, I know about such a man,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:3	pkl5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	οἶδα τὸν τοιοῦτον ἄνθρωπον	1	Here Paul continues to speak about himself in the third person. Make sure that your translation fits with how you chose to translate [12:2](../12/02.md). Alternate translation: “I know that such a man, that is, me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
12:3	ow23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴτε ἐν σώματι εἴτε χωρὶς τοῦ σώματος οὐκ οἶδα	1	Here Paul again addresses the question about whether the **man** went into heaven in bodily form or not. He uses almost the same words he used in [12:2](../12/02.md), although he does not repeat **I do not know** here. Translate these words as you did in [12:2](../12/02.md). Alternate translation: “whether in bodily form or not in bodily form, I do not know” or “whether physically or spiritually, I do not know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:4	wm7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἡρπάγη εἰς τὸν Παράδεισον, καὶ ἤκουσεν ἄρρητα ῥήματα, ἃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἀνθρώπῳ λαλῆσαι	1	Here Paul continues to speak about himself in the third person. Make sure that your translation fits with how you chose to translate [12:2–3](../12/02.md). Alternate translation: “he, by which I mean I, was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words which are not permitted for a man to speak” or “he was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words which are not permitted for a man to speak. Again, that man is me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
12:4	qv5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡρπάγη εἰς τὸν Παράδεισον, καὶ ἤκουσεν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, Paul implies that it was God. Alternate translation: “God caught him up into Paradise and he heard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:4	ic45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸν Παράδεισον	1	Here, the word **Paradise** refers to a place in heaven where those who have trusted in God live after they die and before Jesus comes back. Paul does not explicitly state whether **Paradise** is the “third heaven” or, more likely, within the “third heaven.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the place where believing people go immediately after they die. Alternate translation: “the place of the believing dead” or “the abode of the dead in heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:4	rdqr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἄρρητα ῥήματα, ἃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἀνθρώπῳ λαλῆσαι	1	The terms **inexpressible** and **which are not permitted for a man to speak** mean similar things. It is possible that **inexpressible** indicates that people are unable to speak these amazing **words**, and **which are not permitted** indicates that God does not allow people to speak these **words**. If you do not have clear ways to express these two ideas and if it would be helpful in your language, you could express the general idea with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “words which a man cannot speak” or “amazing and unrepeatable words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
12:4	jwof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἀνθρώπῳ λαλῆσαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, it is clear from the context that it is God. Alternate translation: “which a man cannot speak” or “which God does not permit a man to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:4	dlb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπῳ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “for a human” or “for a person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
12:5	hpq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὑπὲρ τοῦ τοιούτου, καυχήσομαι, ὑπὲρ δὲ ἐμαυτοῦ, οὐ καυχήσομαι	1	Here Paul finishes talking about himself in the third person. It is clear here that he does so in order to avoid boasting about himself. Make sure that your translation fits with how you translated [12:2–4](../12/02.md). If you have not yet revealed that Paul is speaking about himself, this verse may be a good time to do so. Alternate translation: “On behalf of such a man, who is really myself, I will boast. But on behalf of myself I will not directly boast” or “Since I am that man, I could boast about myself. However, I will not boast about myself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
12:5	i12f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐ καυχήσομαι, εἰ μὴ ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “I will only boast in my weaknesses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
12:5	y3cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **weaknesses**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “about how weak I am” or “about the many ways in which I am weak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:6	a61a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse ([12:5](../12/05.md)). He wishes to say that he could properly boast about the man who ascended to heaven, since that man is himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Now” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
12:6	pkx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ἐὰν & θελήσω καυχήσασθαι, οὐκ ἔσομαι ἄφρων, ἀλήθειαν γὰρ ἐρῶ	1	Paul is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he already knows that the condition is not true. He has decided that he will not **boast**. However, he wants to speak about what would be true if he did actually **boast**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker knows is not true. Alternate translation: “were I actually to desire to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
12:6	adg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀλήθειαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what is true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:6	pc8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	φείδομαι	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “I refrain from boasting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
12:6	krnt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς ἐμὲ λογίσηται ὑπὲρ	1	Here, the phrase **think more of me** refers to how people can think a person is greater or more powerful than they actually are. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “would consider me to be greater than” or “would think more highly of me than” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:6	p8fm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ βλέπει με, ἢ ἀκούει ἐξ ἐμοῦ	1	Here Paul refers to what people can observe him doing and saying. He wants people to think about him only based on what they see him doing and hear him saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “what he sees me do or hears me say” or “what he knows about my deeds and words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:6	m57l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	βλέπει	1	Although the term **he** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “he or she” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
12:7	v5s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ τῇ ὑπερβολῇ τῶν ἀποκαλύψεων, διὸ ἵνα μὴ ὑπεραίρωμαι	1	Here, the phrase **because of the surpassing {nature} of the revelations** could go with: (1) this verse. In this case, the word **therefore** is in an unusual position in the middle of the sentence, and you may need to move it to the beginning of the sentence. Alternate translation: “Therefore, because of the surpassing nature of revelations, so that I would not become super arrogant” (2) the end of the previous verse. If you follow this interpretation, you will need to end the previous verse with no punctuation. Alternate translation: “and also because of the surpassing nature of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not become super arrogant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:7	xxi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ ὑπερβολῇ τῶν ἀποκαλύψεων	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe the **revelations** as **surpassing**. He could mean that the **revelations**: (1) were very great. Alternate translation: “because of how amazing the revelations were” (2) were very many. Alternate translation: “because of how many revelations I received” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
12:7	hu8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδόθη μοι σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “God gave me a thorn in the flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:7	q5e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκόλοψ τῇ σαρκί	1	Here Paul speaks as if a **thorn** was stabbing him in the **flesh**. He could mean that: (1) he had a sickness or ailment that affected his **flesh**, that is, his body. Alternate translation: “a thorn in the flesh, that is, sickness,” (2) people opposed him and his ministry. Alternate translation: “a thorn in the flesh, that is, people opposing me,” (3) a demon attacked him. Alternate translation: “a thorn in the flesh, that is, a demon,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:7	q7lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄγγελος Σατανᾶ	1	Here Paul refers to a **messenger** or angel that came from or was sent by **Satan**, the devil. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Satan’s angel” or “someone sent by Satan” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:7	c09d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κολαφίζῃ	1	Here Paul speaks as if the **messenger of Satan** were physically buffeting or hitting him. He means that the **messenger** caused him to suffer in some physical way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “he might hurt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:7	ehp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἵνα μὴ ὑπεραίρωμαι	2	Here most ancient manuscripts include the clause **so that I would not become super arrogant**. The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient manuscripts do not have this clause. Most likely, this clause was accidentally omitted because Paul had already said it once. So, it is recommended that you use the reading of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
12:8	jbne		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τούτου	1	Here, the word **this** could refer: (1) generally to what Paul described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “this situation” (2) to the “messenger of Satan.” Alternate translation: “this messenger of Satan” (3) to the “thorn in the flesh.” Alternate translation: “this thorn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
12:8	n76p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ὑπὲρ τούτου & ἵνα ἀποστῇ ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Here Paul refers both to what he **begged the Lord** about (**this**) and what he wanted the Lord to do (**that he would remove {it} from me**). If referring to both of these things would be redundant in your language, and if it would be helpful, you could combine **about this** with **that he would remove {it} from me**. Alternate translation: “that he would remove this from me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
12:8	wc7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποστῇ	1	Here, the subject of **remove** could be: (1) the **Lord**, who can **remove** the thorn and the suffering it causes. Alternate translation: “he would take it away” (2) the thorn, or messenger of Satan, which can **remove** itself from Paul. Alternate translation: “it would depart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:9	di10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	εἴρηκέν μοι	1	Here Paul repeats what the Lord said in response to his prayer that the thorn and its suffering be taken away. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces the answer to a question or prayer. Alternate translation: “he has answered me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
12:9	km91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	μοι, ἀρκεῖ σοι ἡ χάρις μου, ἡ γὰρ δύναμις ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ τελεῖται	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to remove the quotation marks. Alternate translation: “to me that his grace is enough for me, for his power is being made perfect in weakness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
12:9	nr2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀρκεῖ σοι ἡ χάρις μου, ἡ γὰρ δύναμις ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ τελεῖται	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **grace**, **power**, and **weakness**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “How I act graciously is enough for you, for when people are weak, I perfect how powerfully I work through them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:9	axcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σοι	1	Because God is speaking to one person, Paul, the pronoun **you** in the quotation is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
12:9	cs63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ γὰρ δύναμις ἐν ἀσθενείᾳ τελεῖται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, it is clear from the context that it is the Lord. Alternate translation: “for I make my power perfect in weakness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:9	t5um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μᾶλλον & ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις μου	1	Here, the phrase **even more** could indicate that Paul will: (1) boast more in his **weaknesses** than he has already. Alternate translation: “more than I already have in my weaknesses” (2) boast in his **weaknesses** rather than praying for the removal of the thorn. Alternate translation: “in my weaknesses rather than asking God to remove them” (3) boast in his **weaknesses** rather than in his strengths. Alternate translation: “in my weaknesses rather than in my strengths” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:9	usod		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ταῖς ἀσθενείαις μου, ἵνα ἐπισκηνώσῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ἡ δύναμις τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **weaknesses** and **power**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “about how weak I am so that Christ will reside upon me to empower me” or “in how weak I am so that Christ will give his power to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:9	adcs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ δύναμις τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **power** that comes from **Christ**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “power from Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
12:9	g8mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπισκηνώσῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **the power of Christ** were a person who could **reside** in or **upon** Paul, who is pictured like a tent or house. He means that **the power of Christ** consistently becomes part of his life and is something that he can always have. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a similar figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “might live in me” or “might always be with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:10	pxf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐδοκῶ	1	Here Paul means that he is content with these bad experiences and is even happy that he experiences them, because Christ works through him when these bad things happen. He does not mean that he enjoys the bad experiences themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I rejoice when I live” or “I am content to suffer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:10	s5sx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀσθενείαις, ἐν ὕβρεσιν, ἐν ἀνάγκαις, ἐν διωγμοῖς, καὶ στενοχωρίαις	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas in this clause, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “in being weak, in being insulted, in being coerced, in being persecuted and distressed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:10	xl8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐν ἀσθενείαις, ἐν ὕβρεσιν, ἐν ἀνάγκαις, ἐν διωγμοῖς, καὶ στενοχωρίαις, ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **for the sake of Christ** could go with: (1) the entire list of bad experiences. Alternate translation: “in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions and distresses whenever I experience them for the sake of Christ” (2) the verb **take delight**. Alternate translation: “for the sake of Christ in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions and distresses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:10	t7qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Paul takes **delight** in these bad experiences. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a claim. Alternate translation: “that is because” or “I do that since” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
12:11	a1ym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γέγονα ἄφρων	1	Here Paul means that he has spoken in **foolish** ways in the previous several chapters. He does not mean that he is always a **foolish** person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I have been talking in foolish ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:11	pzw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς με ἠναγκάσατε	1	Here Paul means is that reason why he had to speak in **foolish** ways is that the Corinthians were behaving wrongly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the way you are acting has compelled me to do so” or “how you are behaving has made me act this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:11	bkxl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ὑμεῖς με ἠναγκάσατε	1	Here, the word translated **yourselves** emphasizes **you**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **you** in your language. Alternate translation: “you indeed compelled me” or “it is you who compelled me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
12:11	c25h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of how the Corinthians **compelled** Paul to be foolish. He goes on to explain that they should have been commending him, but they have not done so. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “That is because” or “You compelled me because, although it has not happened,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
12:11	v2lr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγὼ & ὤφειλον ὑφ’ ὑμῶν συνίστασθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you ought to commend me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:11	rada		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑστέρησα	1	Here Paul could be using the past tense because: (1) he is referring to the time when he was with the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “when I visited you, I lacked” (2) he is speaking of what is generally true. Alternate translation: “I lack” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:11	h4d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν & ὑστέρησα τῶν ὑπέρλίαν ἀποστόλων	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative verb **lacked** and the negative word **nothing**. Alternate translation: “I have everything that the ‘super-apostles’ have” or “I am just as good as the ‘super-apostles’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
12:11	s82x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τῶν ὑπέρλίαν ἀποστόλων	1	Here Paul refers to his opponents, the false teachers, with the words that they themselves or their followers used to describe them: **“super-apostles”**. He does not actually believe that these people are better apostles or greater than anyone else. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is speaking from someone else’s perspective to make a point. See how you translated the similar phrase in [11:5](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: “of the so-called ‘super-apostles’” or “of those who consider themselves ‘super-apostles’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
12:11	v4xc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ	1	Paul speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is uncertain, then you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that is contrasting but true. Alternate translation: “although” or “despite the fact that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
12:11	ulah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐδέν εἰμι	1	Here Paul speaks as if he were actually **nothing**. What he means is that he himself is not great or powerful at all without Christ working through him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “I am worthless on my own” or “I myself have no power or authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
12:12	i6sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	μὲν	1	Here, the word translated **Indeed** could: (1) connect this sentence to the previous claim that Paul is equal to the “super-apostles.” You could use a word or phrase that links two statements, or you could leave **Indeed** untranslated. Alternate translation: “In fact” (2) introduce the first part of a contrast. In this case, Paul does not directly state the second half of the contrast. He would be implying that they did not pay attention to these **signs**. Alternate translation: “Although you did not pay attention to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
12:12	fgc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ & σημεῖα τοῦ ἀποστόλου	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **signs** that prove that someone is **an apostle**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the signs that show that someone is an apostle” or “signs that go along with true apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
12:12	kp5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ & σημεῖα τοῦ ἀποστόλου κατειργάσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, Paul could be implying that: (1) he performed the **signs**. Alternate translation: “I performed the signs of an apostle” (2) God performed the **signs** through him. Alternate translation: “God performed the signs of an apostle through me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:12	t05n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ὑπομονῇ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **endurance**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “without ceasing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:12	dnle		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπομονῇ— σημείοις τε, καὶ τέρασιν, καὶ δυνάμεσιν	1	Here, the list, **both signs and wonders and miracles**, could be: (1) examples of what the **signs of an apostle** were. Alternate translation: “endurance, which included both signs and wonders and miracles” (2) the ways in which Paul demonstrated the **signs of an apostle**. Alternate translation: “endurance, shown through signs and wonders and miracles” or “endurance with both signs and wonders and miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:12	d4um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σημείοις τε, καὶ τέρασιν, καὶ δυνάμεσιν	1	Here Paul uses three similar words to describe supernatural acts that God empowered Paul to do. The word **signs** emphasizes that these acts reveal something; the word **wonders** emphasizes that these acts are amazing or unusual; the word **miracles** emphasizes that these acts are powerful. Paul uses these three words to show that he performed various acts that showed that he was an apostle. If your language does not have different words that emphasize these three aspects of the supernatural acts, you could combine two or all three of these words into one word or phrase and emphasize the variety in another way. Alternate translation: “many and various miracles” or “both many signs and various miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
12:13	aclx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces another reason why the Corinthians should consider Paul to be trustworthy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces another reason, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Even more,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
12:13	sy7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	τί & ἐστιν ὃ ἡσσώθητε ὑπὲρ τὰς λοιπὰς ἐκκλησίας, εἰ μὴ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐγὼ οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμῶν? χαρίσασθέ μοι τὴν ἀδικίαν ταύτην!	1	Here Paul speaks from the perspective of his opponents, who tell the Corinthians that Paul has committed an **injustice** in treating them **worse** than the other churches by not asking them for money. He speaks from their perspective to show the Corinthians that this perspective is foolish and wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly expresses that Paul is speaking from another person’s perspective. Alternate translation: “people say that you were treated worse than the remaining churches because I myself did not burden you. If that is true, you need to forgive me for this injustice.” or “what is the way that you were treated worse than the remaining churches? The only way I treated you differently was by not burdening you. If people call that an injustice, please forgive me for it!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
12:13	z35e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί & ἐστιν ὃ ἡσσώθητε ὑπὲρ τὰς λοιπὰς ἐκκλησίας, εἰ μὴ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐγὼ οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμῶν?	1	Paul is using the question form to show the Corinthians that he treated them like all the other churches except for not asking for money. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or a negation. Alternate translation: “I did not treat you worse than the remaining churches except that I myself did not burden you.” or “Besides not burdening you, I treated you just as well as the remaining churches.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:13	tctz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	τί & ἐστιν ὃ ἡσσώθητε ὑπὲρ τὰς λοιπὰς ἐκκλησίας, εἰ μὴ ὅτι αὐτὸς ἐγὼ οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμῶν	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “beyond the fact that I myself did not burden you, what is the way that you were treated worse than the remaining churches” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
12:13	pr0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡσσώθητε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was Paul. Alternate translation: “I treated you worse” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])\n\n
12:13	skav		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰς λοιπὰς ἐκκλησίας	1	Here Paul refers to the other **churches** that he works with. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to other churches that Paul knows and helps. Alternate translation: “the other churches that I serve” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:13	d426		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς ἐγὼ οὐ κατενάρκησα ὑμῶν	1	Here Paul speaks of asking for money as if it were a heavy **burden** that he would have asked the Corinthians to carry for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. See how you translated the similar phrase in [11:9](../11/09.md). Alternate translation: “I myself did not trouble you” or “I myself did not ask for money and so harass you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:13	k7a2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς ἐγὼ	1	Here, the word translated **myself** emphasizes **I**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **I** in your language. Alternate translation: “I, for one,” or “I indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
12:13	u1w9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀδικίαν ταύτην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **injustice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for acting unjustly” or “for doing what is unjust” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:14	g8mz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, the word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: “Listen to this” or “Hear this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
12:14	ngzf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ καταναρκήσω	1	Here Paul speaks of asking for money as if it were a heavy **burden** that he could have asked the Corinthians to carry for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. See how you translated the similar phrase in [12:13](../12/13.md).

Alternate translation: “I will not burden you, because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
12:14	qchp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ὑμῶν, ἀλλὰ ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul contrasts **the things** that the Corinthians have, or their possessions, with the Corinthians themselves. What he means is that he does not want the money and possessions that the Corinthians have. Instead, he wants the Corinthians themselves; that is, he wants them to trust him and Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “the things you own, but your loyalty” or “your possessions, but your trust in the Messiah and in me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:14	ugk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ ὑμᾶς	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but I seek you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
12:14	pzkf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	2	Here, the word **For** introduces an example that illustrates why Paul acts as he does. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an example. Alternate translation: “As an illustration of this,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

Alternate translation: “For the parents should store up for the children, not the children for the parents” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:14	ne5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ γὰρ ὀφείλει τὰ τέκνα τοῖς γονεῦσιν θησαυρίζειν, ἀλλὰ οἱ γονεῖς τοῖς τέκνοις	1	Here Paul speaks of himself as a parent and the Corinthians as his **children**. In Paul’s culture, **parents** generally saved money for their **children** to use. Paul uses this custom to illustrate how he, as a parent, should be giving to the Corinthians instead of the Corinthians, as children, giving to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is speaking of himself as a parent and the Corinthians as children. Alternate translation: “For children, like you, should not store up for your parents, like me. Rather, the parents, like me, should store up for the children, like you.” or “For I am like your parent, and you are like my children. Children should not store up for the parent, but the parent for the children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:14	wd97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οἱ γονεῖς τοῖς τέκνοις	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

Alternate translation: “I will most gladly exhaust everything I have and be completely exhausted” or “I will most gladly use all my resources and be completely worn out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:15	kqgk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκδαπανηθήσομαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “allow other people to completely spend me” or “let external things completely spend me” (2) he does it to himself. Alternate translation: “completely wear myself out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:15	nk8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑπὲρ τῶν ψυχῶν ὑμῶν	1	Here, the phrase **your souls** represents the Corinthians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for your sake” or “for the sake of your lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
12:15	t3na		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	εἰ περισσοτέρως ὑμᾶς ἀγαπῶν, ἧσσον ἀγαπῶμαι?	1	Paul is using the question form to rebuke the Corinthians for loving him **less** when he loves them **more abundantly**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a rebuke or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Since I love you more abundantly, I should not be loved less.” or “Given that I love you more abundantly, I should not be loved less!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:15	e16a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & ἀγαπῶν	1	Paul speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since I love” or “Given that I love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
12:15	gjbk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἀγαπῶν	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **loving**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “I love.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n
12:15	j887		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περισσοτέρως & ἧσσον	1	Here Paul uses two comparison words without indicating exactly what he is comparing. He could mean that: (1) his love is increasing in comparison to the Corinthians’ love, which is decreasing. Alternate translation: “more than ever … less than ever” (2) he has much love, while the Corinthians have little love. Alternate translation: “greatly … only a little” (3) his love for them is greater than his love for other churches, while the Corinthians love him less than other churches do. Alternate translation: “more abundantly than I love other churches … less than they love me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:15	u9y0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἧσσον ἀγαπῶμαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, it is clear from the context that it is the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “am I to receive less love” or “are you going to love me less” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:16	gvv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔστω δέ, ἐγὼ οὐ κατεβάρησα ὑμᾶς; ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the phrase **But let it be {so}** indicates that something is agreed upon or certainly true. Paul could be referring to: (1) what he is about to say about not being a **burden** to the Corinthians. He means that he and the Corinthians can agree about that. Alternate translation: “But here is what we can agree on: I myself did not burden you. However” (2) what he said in the previous verse about loving the Corinthians, although he may be loved less. He means that even if that is true, he will still not **burden** the Corinthians. Alternate translation: “Besides all that, I myself did not burden you. However,” or “Even if that has happened, I myself did not burden you. However,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:16	binl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἐγὼ οὐ κατεβάρησα	1	Here, the word translated **myself** emphasizes **I**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **I** in your language. Alternate translation: “I indeed did not burden” or “as for me, I did not burden” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
12:16	mnvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγὼ οὐ κατεβάρησα ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul speaks of asking for money as if it were a heavy **burden** that he would have asked the Corinthians to carry for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or plain language. See how you translated the similar phrase in [12:14](../12/14.md). Alternate translation: “I myself did not trouble you” or “I myself did not ask for money and so harass you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

They may think or say that Paul was **crafty** and **caught** them **by deceit**. He speaks from their perspective so that he can respond to this claim in the following verses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly expresses that Paul is speaking from another person’s perspective. Alternate translation: “but someone may say that I, being crafty, caught you by deceit” or “but you may think that I caught you by deceit, being crafty” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a negation or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I have not taken advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent to you!” or “There is no one whom I have sent to you through whom I took advantage of you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:17	nex4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ	1	Although the term **him** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Most likely any person whom Paul **sent** would be a man, but Paul is not making this claim. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “him or her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
12:18	psbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρεκάλεσα Τίτον καὶ συναπέστειλα τὸν ἀδελφόν	1	Here Paul refers to a trip Titus took previously to visit the Corinthians. He is probably referring to the visit he mentions in [8:6](../08/06.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to a trip that has already been completed. Alternate translation: “I urged Titus to go to you previously, and I sent the other brother with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:18	urtj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τὸν ἀδελφόν	1	Here Paul assumes that the Corinthians know who this **brother** is, so he does not name him. Since we do not know who this person was, you should not make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “a brother” or “the brother you know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
12:18	kmt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν ἀδελφόν	1	Paul is using the term **brother** to mean a person who shares the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the other believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:18	pjl2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μήτι ἐπλεονέκτησεν ὑμᾶς Τίτος?	1	Paul is using the question form to remind the Corinthians that **Titus** did not take advantage of them.

Alternate translation: “Did Titus and I not walk … Did Titus and I not walk” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:18	acg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ τῷ αὐτῷ πνεύματι περιεπατήσαμεν	1	Paul speaks of behavior in life as if it were walking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Did we not behave according to the same spirit” or “Did we not live in the same spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:18	f4e0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ αὐτῷ πνεύματι	1	Here, the word **spirit** could refer to: (1) the **spirit** of a person, which refers to the inner life of a person, that is, how that person thinks, feels, and makes decisions. Alternate translation: “in the same mind” or “in the same heart” (2) the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “in the same Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:18	oket		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ τοῖς αὐτοῖς ἴχνεσιν?	1	Here Paul speaks as if he and Titus walked on the same path so closely together that the person walking behind stepped in the **footsteps** of the person in front. He means that they did and said very similar things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Did we not act in the same ways” or “Did we not behave in very similar ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:19	g1iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πάλαι δοκεῖτε ὅτι ὑμῖν ἀπολογούμεθα?	1	Paul is using the question form to deny that what he has said is primarily for the purpose of **defending ourselves**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Do not think that all of this time we have been defending ourselves to you!” or “I want you to realize that all of this time we have not been defending ourselves to you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:19	m3vx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλαι	1	Here, the phrase **all of this time** refers to everything that Paul has written so far in this letter.

12:19	ih3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατέναντι Θεοῦ	1	Here, just as with the phrase “in the presence of God” in [2:17](../02/17.md), the phrase **Before God** could indicate that: (1) Paul and his fellow workers speak as they do because they know that God sees or knows what they do. So, they speak in a way that pleases God. Alternate translation: “As God desires” or “With God watching” (2) Paul and his fellow workers speak with God as a witness guaranteeing what they say. Alternate translation: “With God as witness” or “With God guaranteeing it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:19	hcor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, explains that Paul and his fellow workers speak from their perspective as those united to Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates this explicitly. Alternate translation: “and in union with Christ” or “and because of being united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:19	y0fs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ & πάντα	1	Here, the phrase **all these things** refers primarily to what Paul has written in this letter so far. However, it also includes everything that Paul and his fellow workers say and do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “all the things we say and do, including in this letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:19	oqmw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀγαπητοί	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that he himself loves them. Alternate translation: “people whom I love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:19	vg3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑπὲρ τῆς ὑμῶν οἰκοδομῆς	1	Here, Paul is speaking of the Corinthian believers as if they were a building. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a more natural metaphor for this or you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar phrase in [10:8](../10/08.md). Alternate translation: “are to help you become more faithful to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:20	fqdk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) a reason why Paul has written what he has in this letter. Alternate translation: “I have written these things because” (2) a reason why Paul wants to build them up. Alternate translation: “I want to build you up because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
12:20	cu6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐχ οἵους θέλω & οἷον οὐ θέλετε	1	Here Paul refers to how both he and the Corinthians have ideas about how they think the other person should be behaving. He fears that these ideas will not be accurate. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “not such as I expect … not such as you expect” or “not what I want you to be like … not what you want me to be like” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:20	zy6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	θέλετε; μή πως	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “you wish; I fear that somehow there may be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
12:20	aw5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μή πως ἔρις	1	Here Paul implies that they are doing all these wrong things within their own group. He does not mean that they are doing these things to people outside their group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this more explicit. Alternate translation: “that, within your group, somehow there may be quarreling” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:20	rh1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μή πως ἔρις, ζῆλος, θυμοί, ἐριθεῖαι, καταλαλιαί, ψιθυρισμοί, φυσιώσεις, ἀκαταστασίαι	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for any of the ideas in this list, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “that somehow you may be quarrelsome, jealous, angry, competitive, slanderous, gossiping, proud, and disruptive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:21	ddw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	μὴ	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the previous verse if it would be clearer in your language (see [12:20](../12/20.md)). Alternate translation: “and I fear that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
12:21	blba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	πάλιν ἐλθόντος μου, ταπεινώσῃ με ὁ Θεός μου	1	Here the word **again** could go with: (1) **I come**. In this case, Paul is speaking about how he plans to visit the Corinthians a third time. Alternate translation: “when I come yet again, my God might humble me” (2) **God might humble me**. In this case, Paul means that God may **humble** him again, just as he did when Paul visited the Corinthians previously (see [2:1](../02/01.md)). Alternate translation: “when I come, my God might humble me again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:21	ozce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταπεινώσῃ με ὁ Θεός μου πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ	1	Here Paul could be implying that God will **humble** him: (1) because he would feel ashamed about how the Corinthians were acting. Alternate translation: “my God might humble me by making me feel shame about you, and” (2) because he would have to use his authority for tearing down instead of building up. Alternate translation: “my God might humble me before you by making me punish you, and” (3) because he would **mourn** publicly. Alternate translation: “my God might humble me before you because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:21	knmg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ Θεός μου	1	When Paul speaks of **my God**, he does not mean that this is a different **God** than the one the Corinthians believe in. Rather, he simply wishes to state that this **God** is his God. If the phrase **my God** sounds like it makes a distinction between Paul’s God and the Corinthians’ God, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the God I serve” or “our God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
12:21	hq1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τῇ ἀκαθαρσίᾳ, καὶ πορνείᾳ, καὶ ἀσελγείᾳ	1	The terms **impurity**, **sexual immorality**, and **debauchery** mean similar things. Paul is using the three terms together to include all types of sexual sin. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with two words or a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the debauchery and sexual immorality” or “the many kinds of sexual immorality” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
12:21	rh22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ τῇ ἀκαθαρσίᾳ, καὶ πορνείᾳ, καὶ ἀσελγείᾳ, ᾗ ἔπραξαν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **impurity**, **immorality**, and **debauchery**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “from acting in impure ways and doing sexually immoral things and enjoying indecent actions” or “from acting in impure and sexually immoral and indecent ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:intro	abcg				0	# 2 Corinthians 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Paul defends his apostolic authority (10:1–13:10)\n     * Paul warns the Corinthians about his third visit (12:19–13:10)\n8. Closing (13:11–13)\n\nIn this chapter, Paul finishes defending his authority. He then concludes the letter with a final greeting and blessing.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Preparation\n\nPaul instructs the Corinthians as he prepares to visit them. He is hoping to avoid needing to discipline anyone in the church, so he can visit them joyfully. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Power and weakness\n\nPaul repeatedly uses the contrasting concepts “power” and “weakness” in this chapter. The translator should use words that are understood to be opposites of each other. It seems that people had been criticizing Paul for speaking powerfully in his letters, but being weak when in person (see 10:1). Paul explains that although he is weak, Christ works powerfully through him (13:3-4). God gave Paul power and authority to discipline believers who are living sinfully, but Paul prefers to use this power to encourage the believers to trust in God rather than to discipline them for not living in the right way (13:10). This is why he did not visit them again. It was so that he could persuade them in a letter rather than discipline them harshly in person (1:23;10:2;13:2,10).\n\n### Examine yourselves\n\nScholars are divided about the examination that Paul has in mind in verse 5. Some scholars say that believers are to test themselves to see whether their actions align with their Christian faith. The context favors this understanding. Others say that this test is to determine if the person actually belongs to God or not. Paul may have both ideas in mind. If a person examines his actions, finds them to be sinful but refuses to change them, then he has rejected God.\n\n### Approved and unapproved\n\nIn 13:5-7, Paul uses the concepts “approved” and “unapproved.” The words he uses for these are forms of the word translated “examine” in 13:5. The idea then, is that someone who is "approved" has been examined and has passed the examination. Paul begins in verse 5 by asking the Corinthian believers to examine themselves, to see if they are living as God wants them to live. Then in verse 6 he challenges them to evaluate Paul and his companions in that same way, because they are living in the right way. Finally, in verse 7 he says that he does not care about this kind of approval from them or from any humans, but he only wants the Corinthian believers to pass this test to show that God approves of them.
13:1	slj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπὶ στόματος δύο μαρτύρων καὶ τριῶν σταθήσεται πᾶν ῥῆμα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Only if two or three people have said the same thing about another person should God’s people believe that it is true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:1	xfhc			ἐπὶ στόματος δύο μαρτύρων καὶ τριῶν σταθήσεται πᾶν ῥῆμα	1	Paul is quoting here from Deuteronomy 19:15. He has been accusing the Corinthian believers of doing wrong, and so he compares the number of his visits, during which he has observed and will observe this wrong behavior, with the number of witnesses that the Old Testament required for convicting someone of doing wrong. You may want to include some of this information in a footnote.
13:1	gs3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ στόματος	1	Paul is using the term **mouth** to mean the words that people say by using their mouths. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural expression from your language or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by the word” or “on the testimony” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:2	fxl6			τοῖς λοιποῖς πᾶσιν	1	Alternate translation: “to all of you other believers”
13:2	ijip		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν ἔλθω	1	Paul speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that he does intend to come again to Corinth. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is uncertain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “when I come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
13:2	kfzf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ φείσομαι	1	The implication is that, when Paul comes, he will punish any believer there who is continuing to live sinfully. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I will not withhold punishment from anyone who is sinning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:2	da34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ φείσομαι	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **spare**. Alternate translation: “I will certainly punish everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
13:3	svtr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δοκιμὴν ζητεῖτε τοῦ ἐν ἐμοὶ λαλοῦντος Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **proof**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “you want me to prove that Christ speaks through me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:3	kiw2			ἐν ἐμοὶ λαλοῦντος	1	Alternate translation: “speaking through me”
13:3	ffwe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃς	1	The pronoun **who** refers to **Christ**. If this is not clear for your readers, you could include “Christ” here. Alternate translation: “Christ, who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
13:3	vd3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλὰ δυνατεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν	1	The implication is that Christ will be powerful among the Corinthian believers when Paul comes and disciplines them using Christ’s power. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but will punish you powerfully when I come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:4	a1bf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ & ἐσταυρώθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they crucified him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:4	rha6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ἀσθενείας	-1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **weakness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when he was weak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:4	kh0y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ δυνάμεως Θεοῦ	-1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **power**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “because God works powerfully … because God works powerfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:4	ezsm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀσθενοῦμεν ἐν αὐτῷ	-1	Here, Paul is speaking of his relationship to Christ as if he were inside of Christ. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “are weak as we imitate him” or “are weak, just as he was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:5	ybkc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑαυτοὺς πειράζετε & ἑαυτοὺς δοκιμάζετε	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If your language does not have two ways to say this, you could repeat the same phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Test yourselves … Indeed, you must test yourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
13:5	z2oq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἑαυτοὺς	-1	The word translated **yourselves** is plural, referring to all of the Corinthian believers. However, the meaning is that each believer is to examine himself, not that they should examine each other. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as singular, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
13:5	q28n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐστὲ ἐν τῇ πίστει	1	Here, Paul is speaking of **faith** as if it were something which the Corinthians could be inside. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you truly believe in the Messiah” or “you are being faithful to the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:5	qvxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ οὐκ ἐπιγινώσκετε ἑαυτοὺς, ὅτι Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν, εἰ μήτι ἀδόκιμοί ἐστε	1	Paul is using the question form here to emphasize to the Corinthian believers something that is true: that Jesus Christ does live in them. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You know that it is Jesus Christ himself who lives within you—unless you are not in the faith.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
13:5	sbx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Here, **in you** could mean: (1) Jesus is intimately connected to each believing individual, as if Jesus were living inside each person. Alternate translation: “part of who you are” (2) Jesus is living among them, part of and the most important member of the group. Alternate translation: “among you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:6	xk7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐλπίζω	1	Paul speaks as if he were uncertain about whether or not the Corinthian believers would understand that he is a true follower or apostle of Christ. He does this in order to convey modesty, but he is actually sure that they know that he is a true follower of Christ. If your language does not state something as uncertain if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying here is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “I am sure” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
13:6	f8o8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἡμεῖς & ἐσμὲν	1	Here the word **ourselves** emphasizes that Paul is talking about his apostolic team, who introduced the Corinthian believers to Jesus Christ. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: “we, yes, we, are” or “we, who serve Jesus, are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
13:6	fqbe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡμεῖς & ἐσμὲν	1	Paul is referring here to himself and his apostolic team, who introduced the Corinthian believers to Jesus Christ. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “we, the very ones who brought you to Christ, are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:6	zhkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἐσμὲν ἀδόκιμοι	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative word **unapproved**.

13:6	i34s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡμεῖς οὐκ ἐσμὲν ἀδόκιμοι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the testing or approving, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “we ourselves have passed this test” or “God has accepted us ourselves as his own” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:7	pu5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Paul is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a slightly new topic. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this, or it may be more natural to leave it out. Alternate translation: “Also,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
13:7	u75e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ποιῆσαι ὑμᾶς κακὸν μηδέν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative word **wrong**. Alternate translation: “you may do everything right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
13:7	kmld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡμεῖς δόκιμοι φανῶμεν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in these ways, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the actions, it is people in general who do the seeing and either God or people who do the approving. Alternate translation: “people see that, for our part, God approves of us” or “people see our work with you and approve of us, the workers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:7	gt2e			δόκιμοι	1	Alternate translation: “having gained God’s approval”
13:7	wcrp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἡμεῖς & ὑμεῖς & ἡμεῖς	1	Paul uses the words **ourselves** and **yourselves** to emphasize the difference between his thinking and the thinking of the Corinthian believers. He wants only good for them, while they suspect that he wants only good for himself. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. If you use the following suggestion, it will need a comma before each phrase. Alternate translation: “on our part, … on your part, … on our part,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
13:7	yiww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡμεῖς δὲ ὡς ἀδόκιμοι ὦμεν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the approving, it is either God or people in general. Alternate translation: “even if it seems that God has not approved of us ourselves” or “even if people think that we ourselves have had no part in your success” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:8	bqd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	The word translated as **For** indicates that what follows is a reason for what came before. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: “This is because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
13:8	jvke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἀληθείας	-1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way.

Use a connector that indicates that this is another reason, if that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You see,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
13:9	h8h6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἡμεῖς & ὑμεῖς	1	Here, as in verse 7, the words **ourselves** and **yourselves** emphasize the difference between Paul and the Corinthian believers. He wants them to be strong in the Lord, and it doesn’t matter if people think that he is weak. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. If you use the following suggestion, it will need a comma before each phrase. Alternate translation: “on our part, … on your part,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
13:9	ep5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο καὶ εὐχόμεθα	1	The pronoun **this** here refers to what Paul desires for the Corinthian believers, which he states in two ways. First, that they be **powerful** in serving God, and then for their **restoration** to a right relationship with God. Those are both the same thing. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use a clearer expression. Alternate translation: “In fact, we pray for this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
13:10	kbpp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	διὰ τοῦτο	1	The pronoun **this** refers to what Paul has just written in verse 9, that he wants the Corinthian believers to be restored to a right relationship with God. If this is not clear for your readers, you could repeat that information here. Alternate translation: “Because I want you to be restored to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
13:10	dqu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ταῦτα	1	The words **these things** refer to what Paul has written in the entire letter, but especially to the warnings and exhortations in chapters 10-13. If this is not clear for your readers, you could include that information here. Alternate translation: “the things in this letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
13:10	kzue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ τὴν ἐξουσίαν ἣν ὁ Κύριος ἔδωκέν μοι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as the person that the Lord has authorized” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:10	rlm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς οἰκοδομὴν καὶ οὐκ εἰς καθαίρεσιν.	1	Here, Paul is speaking of the Corinthian believers as if they were a building. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a more natural metaphor for this or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to help you become more faithful to Christ and not to make you want to forsake him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:11	bdql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
13:11	fm8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταρτίζεσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See how you translated a form of this word at the end of verse 9. Alternate translation: “Work toward maturity” or “Decide to trust and obey God completely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:11	nfyp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παρακαλεῖσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The person doing the encouraging could be: (1) Paul. Alternate translation: “allow me to encourage you” (2) God. Alternate translation: “receive encouragement from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:11	diw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ αὐτὸ φρονεῖτε	1	Here, **think the same** means to agree on the most important things and to not argue about the lesser things. Alternate translation: “make sure that you all agree on what is important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:11	axul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰρηνεύετε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “be peaceful with each other” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:11	vrfk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς ἀγάπης καὶ εἰρήνης	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **God** as being characterized by **love and peace**. This probably means both that God is the source of love and peace and also that he enables his people to have love and peace. Try to include both meanings, if possible. Alternate translation: “God, who gives love and peace,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
13:11	t9io		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς ἀγάπης καὶ εἰρήνης	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **love and peace**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

13:12	p1nh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐν ἁγίῳ φιλήματι	1	A **holy kiss** was a symbolic action to show familial love between believers. In some cultures, a kiss as a greeting is appropriate, but in other cultures it is not appropriate. The idea of a **holy kiss** is that it be a greeting that is appropriate in the culture, whether it be a kiss, a hug, a handshake, or something else, and also that it be **holy**, that is, appropriate between God’s people. If this would not be clear to your readers, you can explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: “warmly, as fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
13:12	x2qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ ἅγιοι	1	These **saints** are the fellow believers who are there with Paul. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “your fellow believers here” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

You can express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I pray for all of you that the Lord Jesus Christ will give you his grace, that God will give you his love, and that the Holy Spirit will give you his fellowship.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
13:13	st07		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ ἡ κοινωνία τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος, μετὰ πάντων ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **grace**, **love**, and **fellowship**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “May the Lord Jesus Christ continue to be gracious to you, may God continue to love you, and may the Holy Spirit unite you all closely together as believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
