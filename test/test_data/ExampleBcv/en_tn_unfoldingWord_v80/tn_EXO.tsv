The first half of Exodus is about how Yahweh made Abraham’s descendants into a nation. This nation, which would be called “Israel,” was meant to belong to Yahweh and worship him. The second half of Exodus describes how God gave the Israelites his law through Moses. The law of Moses told the Israelites how to obey and worship Yahweh properly.\n\nThe book of Exodus tells how the Israelites were to build the Dwelling. The Dwelling was a tent where Yahweh would be among his people. The Israelites worshiped and sacrificed animals to Yahweh at the Dwelling. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\n“Exodus” means “exit” or “departure.” Translators may translate this title in a way that can communicate its subject clearly, for example, “About the Israelites Leaving Egypt” or “How the Israelites Left the Land of Egypt.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Exodus?\n\nThe writers of both the Old and New Testaments present Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Exodus. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.\n\n### Why did Moses write so much about God delivering or rescuing the people of Israel?\n\nMoses wrote much about God rescuing his people from the Egyptians to show that Yahweh is very powerful. Egypt was a very powerful nation in the region at that time, but Yahweh was still able to free the Israelites from the Egyptians. Also, by rescuing the Israelites, Yahweh showed that he had chosen them as his people and that they should worship him.\n\n### How does the book of Exodus show the fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham?\n\nThe book of Exodus shows God beginning to fulfill his promise to Abraham. In Genesis, God promised Abraham that he would have many descendants and that they would become a large nation. When God rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians, he took them to Mount Sinai. There he made a covenant with them, and they became the nation that belonged to Yahweh.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the Jewish Passover?\n\nThe Jewish Passover was a religious festival. Yahweh commanded the Israelites to celebrate it every year. Passover was a time to remember how God rescued Israel from the Egyptians. The first Passover meal was eaten in the evening just before they left Egypt. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])\n\n### What was the law of Moses to the people of Israel?\n\nThe law of Moses instructed the people of Israel about what Yahweh required them to do as his people. In the law, God told the people how they should live so that they would honor him. He also instructed them about their need to offer animal sacrifices. God required these sacrifices so that he could forgive their sins and continue living among them. The law also described the duties of the priests and told how to build the Dwelling.\n\n### What did it mean that Israel was to be a “kingdom of priests and a holy nation” ([19:6](../19/06.md) ULT)?\n\nIsrael was a holy nation because Yahweh separated them from all other nations to belong to him. They were to honor and worship him only. This made them different from all the other nations of the world; the other nations worshiped many false gods.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Thus says Yahweh\n\nThis phrase is used many times in the Old Testament to introduce Yahweh’s speech. Your team should pick a standard translation. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more.\n\n### Pharaoh’s stubborn heart\n\nBetween chapters 4 and 14, there are 18 cases where Pharaoh’s heart is described as strong (11x), heavy (6x), or hard (1x), and one case where the Egyptians’ hearts are described as strong. These are metaphors for being stubborn, that is, being unwilling to obey Yahweh or even to do what is clearly in his own and Egypt’s best interest. Many cultures have similar metaphors, but not all will use the same body part. Within these cases, six times there is a neutral description that Pharaoh was stubborn, without saying anyone made him so ([7:13](../07/13.md), [7:14](../07/14.md), [7:22](../07/22.md), [8:19](../08/19.md), [9:7](../09/07.md), [9:35](../09/35.md)); three times Pharaoh makes himself stubborn ([8:15](../08/15.md), [8:32](../08/32.md), [9:34](../09/34.md)); and ten times Yahweh makes Pharaoh/the Egyptians stubborn ([4:21](../04/21.md), [7:3](../07/03.md), [9:12](../09/12.md), [10:1](../10/01.md), [10:20](../10/20.md), [10:27](../10/27.md), [11:10](../11/10.md), [14:4](../14/04.md), [14:8](../14/08.md), [14:17](../14/17.md)).\n\n### Why are the details of the construction of the Dwelling in Exodus 25–32 repeated in Exodus 35–40?\n\nIn Exodus 25–32, God describes exactly how the Dwelling was to be built. The details were repeated in Exodus 35–40 in the description of the actual construction. This showed that the people were careful to do exactly as God commanded.\n\n### Are the events in the order that they actually happened?\n\nMost, but not all, of the events in the book of Exodus are told in the order that they actually happened. Translators may need to make it clear when the events are in an unusual order.\n\n### What does it mean that God “lived” among his people?\n\nThe book of Exodus presents God as living in the Dwelling among the nation of Israel. God is everywhere, but he lived among the Israelites in a special way. God dwelled with the Israelites because they belonged to him. He promised to lead them and bless them. In return, the people were to worship him and honor him.
1:intro	cj55				0	# Exodus 01 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is intended to form a smooth transition from the last chapter of the book of Genesis.\n\n- v. 1-7: Jacob’s family grows\n- v. 8-22: Pharaoh oppresses the Israelites and tries to limit the Israelites’ growth\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Israel’s growth\n\nIsrael grew in number. This was the beginning of God’s fulfilling his promises to Abraham. It also caused the Pharaoh to worry that there would be more Israelites than Egyptians, with the result that the Egyptians would be unable to defend themselves against so many people. Pharaoh tried to kill all of the male babies so they would not become soldiers who fought against him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n- “All of the descendants of Jacob were 70 in number”\nThis number included both Jacob’s children and grandchildren. It may cause confusion, but it is important to remember Jacob only had 12 sons.\n- Starting from verse 7, the terms **Hebrews** and **sons of Israel** both refer to the Israelite nation or people group.\n- God blesses the Hebrew midwives for lying to the wicked Pharaoh. Translators should not attempt to hide this. They showed that they feared God by disobeying a wicked order in order to preserve the lives of God’s people. They “acted wisely toward him” (or shrewdly, see [1:10](../01/10.md)) by lying to foil Pharaoh.\n- Pharaoh is a specifically Egyptian word for their kings (and queens).

This is an instance of the possessive of social relationship. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:9	t7s1			עַמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	There is some ambiguity as to whom exactly Pharaoh was addressing. It could have been: (1) the people who lived in Egypt, the Egyptians or (2) some group of “his people” like his advisors, generals, nobles, or friends and family.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

The pronouns agree grammatically with the singular “people” in the original. This occurs in many places in Exodus. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the plural, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
1:10	il4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	פֶּן־יִרְבֶּ֗ה וְ⁠הָיָ֞ה כִּֽי־תִקְרֶ֤אנָה מִלְחָמָה֙	1	The king suggests a combination of two hypothetical events: 1. There are even more Israelites, 2. There is a battle. These are followed by a series of undesirable consequences: 3. The Israelites join an enemy, 4. The Israelites attack the Egyptians, 5. The Israelites leave Egypt. While the series of consequences is also technically hypothetical, the king’s language indicates that if 1-2 happen, then 3-5 are certain. Use language that makes it clear that the first two events are hypothetical and that the next three are consequences that could be expected if the first two events happen. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
1:10	jc1h			וְ⁠עָלָ֥ה מִן־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Alternate translation: “and he leaves Egypt”

1:16	t8f5			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	In the UST, the phrase and **the king said**, is combined with “spoke” from [verse 15](../01/15.md) (ULT) because the verb for “say” is used twice before he speaks. Having two speech verbs may be strange in some languages. If it would be unnatural to say that the king spoke or said words twice, you may leave one off.

1:18	o97u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	עֲשִׂיתֶ֖ן	1	This **you** is plural. The king is speaking to the two midwives. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

1:19	cxu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֤רְןָ הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹת֙	1	Here, **midwives said** means that a midwife spoke representing the thoughts of the group.

1:19	wl8h			הַֽ⁠מְיַלְּדֹת֙	1	These were women who helped a woman give birth to a baby. See how you translated this in [Exodus 1:15](../01/15.md).

1:20	h133		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַ⁠יִּ֧רֶב & וַ⁠יַּֽעַצְמ֖וּ מְאֹֽד	1	These words mean similar things and are used together to emphasize their numeric growth.

It describes the result of the midwives fearing God with a general statement. If it would be more natural in your language, you could rearrange verses 20-21 so that the reason (verses 21) comes before both the general and specific results.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. However, it could be translated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “And Pharaoh commanded all of his people to throw every baby boy into the river, but to let every girl live.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
1:22	stag		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	תַּשְׁלִיכֻ֔⁠הוּ & תְּחַיּֽוּ⁠ן	1	The uses of the word **you** here refer to all the Egyptians.

This is because many of the participants play very minor roles and because this part of the story is focusing on Moses’ life.\n\n### Moses’ heritage\n\nIn the first part of this chapter, Pharaoh’s daughter recognizes Moses as being a Hebrew, but in the last part of this chapter, the Midianites believe him to be an Egyptian. \n\n### Ironic situations\n\n* While Pharaoh tried to diminish the power of the Israelites by killing all of their baby boys, God used Pharaoh’s own daughter to save Moses.\n* Moses believes he is meant to be the rescuer of his people, but they reject him. Ultimately, Moses was correct, but the people rejected him at this point (see Acts 7).

2:1	riy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִ֖ישׁ & בַּת	1	These are new participants. They remain unnamed until [Exodus 6:20](../06/20.md) where they are identified as Amram and Jochebed. For now it is best to leave them unnamed in your language, if possible.

2:1	mp7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֖ח אֶת־בַּת־לֵוִֽי	1	Here, **took a daughter** is an idiom for marrying. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

2:3	wpb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וַ⁠תַּחְמְרָ֥⁠ה	1	This means that she applied a waterproof coating. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:3	ym3k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַ⁠חֵמָ֖ר	1	This is a sticky black substance made from oil. It can be used to keep out water. Alternate translation: “with tar” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:3	v825		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וּ⁠בַ⁠זָּ֑פֶת	1	This is a sticky brown or black substance that can be made from tree sap. It too can be used to keep out water. Alternate translation: “and with tar” or “and with resin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:3	y8gq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠סּ֖וּף	1	These **reeds** were a type of tall grass with wide blades that formed a flat surface when woven together. They grew in flat, wet areas. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:4	av8b			וַ⁠תֵּתַצַּ֥ב אֲחֹת֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠רָחֹ֑ק	1	This means she stood far enough away so that she would not be noticed, but close enough to see the ark. Use a word that expresses this sort of distance in your language.
2:4	uf14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מֵ⁠רָחֹ֑ק	1	This probably means somewhere in the reeds where she could see the basket, but no one would see her. If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **distance** in another way. Alternate translation: “not far away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:4	ruvb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֲחֹת֖⁠וֹ	1	Here, the actions of **his sister** show that she was older. If your language uses a different term for siblings based on their relative ages or the gender of the siblings or both, use one that means “a boy’s older sister.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
2:4	z1cy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠דֵעָ֕ה מַה־יֵּעָשֶׂ֖ה לֽ⁠וֹ	1	This is her purpose in being close by. Use a natural way in your language for indicating purpose.

2:5	m3i0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶד	1	**Came down** may be literal or figurative, as important places are often considered to be in a higher place. This means she came from her home, probably Pharaoh’s palace. If a perspective is required for Pharaoh’s daughter, you may choose go or come as works best in your language. “Come” is better as the scene is at the river and she comes to the scene location. However, you also need to consider your language’s way of introducing new participants. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:5	y26h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וַ⁠תֵּ֤רֶד בַּת־פַּרְעֹה֙	1	The **daughter of Pharaoh** is introduced here as a new participant. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

2:5	im0d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־יַ֣ד הַ⁠יְאֹ֑ר	1	Here, **hand** is a metaphor for side or, as relating to a river, shore. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could simply translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	bi7s			וְ⁠נַעֲרֹתֶ֥י⁠הָ	1	These were the young women whose job it was to be with her and make sure nothing bad happened to her.
2:5	am7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תִּקָּחֶֽ⁠הָ	1	It is not clear who is meant by **she** here, either Pharaoh’s daughter or the servant. It is likely that Pharaoh’s daughter remains the subject. Alternative translation: “and she took the ark from her slave” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:6	g9n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	The word **behold** signals the surprising information that follows. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
2:6	tyub		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תַּחְמֹ֣ל עָלָ֔י⁠ו	1	The text does not state exactly what caused her to have compassion on the baby. If a reason must be provided in your language, it should be connected to either his crying (this is the better option) or that he was a “good” baby ([verse 2](../02/02.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:6	jg0d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	מִ⁠יַּלְדֵ֥י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֖ים זֶֽה	1	This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. It seems to have been said loud enough for the baby’s sister to hear. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:7	x5ja			וְ⁠קָרָ֤אתִי לָ⁠ךְ֙ אִשָּׁ֣ה מֵינֶ֔קֶת מִ֖ן הָ⁠עִבְרִיֹּ֑ת	1	This is a suggestive question. The child’s sister is hopeful that Pharaoh’s daughter does not yet have a plan for the baby beyond saving his life. However, it is still a true question, for without Pharaoh’s daughter’s permission, the child’s sister will not be able to fetch the woman. If your language has a way of forming questions that are also suggestions, use it here.
2:7	d7aj			מֵינֶ֔קֶת & וְ⁠תֵינִ֥ק	1	Here, **nursing** or **to nurse** means to feed with milk from the breast.
2:7	tqq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	וְ⁠תֵינִ֥ק לָ֖⁠ךְ אֶת־הַ⁠יָּֽלֶד	1	This is the purpose of the sister’s proposal.

2:8	ab1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	לֵ֑כִי & וַ⁠תֵּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	The girl left Pharaoh’s daughter to go to the child’s mother. The girl was almost certainly on foot. Use verbs of motion that express this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:9	u554		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	לָ֣⁠הּ	1	The child’s mother is reintroduced as a participant. Use the natural form in your language for reintroducing a character. Alternative translation: “to the baby’s mother” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
2:9	mogg			שְׂכָרֵ֑⁠ךְ	1	This refers to payment that Pharaoh’s daughter would give to the mother in exchange for her service of nursing the baby.
2:9	hqsa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּקַּ֧ח & וַ⁠תְּנִיקֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	The mother’s acceptance of the deal is implied. You could make it explicit, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:10	zj8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יִגְדַּ֣ל הַ⁠יֶּ֗לֶד וַ⁠תְּבִאֵ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	**And the child grew older** marks an unspecified amount of time. He would have stayed with his mother at least until he was weaned (no longer feeding on his mother’s milk). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
2:10	j7n1			וַֽ⁠יְהִי־לָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠בֵ֑ן	1	Alternate translation: “and he became the adopted son of Pharaoh’s daughter”
2:10	h7to		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וַֽ⁠יְהִי־לָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠בֵ֑ן וַ⁠תִּקְרָ֤א שְׁמ⁠וֹ֙ מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	These events were likely simultaneous, because her act of naming him may have been what made him become **as a son to her**. Consider using a conjunction that does not make a great separation between these events. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
2:10	nh2m			מֹשֶׁ֔ה וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֥י מִן־הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם מְשִׁיתִֽ⁠הוּ	1	Translators may add a footnote that says, “The name Moses sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘draw out.’”
2:10	ityq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר כִּ֥י מִן־הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם מְשִׁיתִֽ⁠הוּ	1	**For** begins a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “because she said she drew him out of the water” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
2:11	tyol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ בַּ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠הֵ֗ם וַ⁠יִּגְדַּ֤ל מֹשֶׁה֙ וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֣א	1	A significant amount of time has passed; later texts state that Moses was 40 years old at this point. Alternative translation: “Many years later, once Moses was grown, he went out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
2:11	p7gx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ בַּ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠הֵ֗	1	This introduces a new event in the story. In your language, use a phrase that indicates a new event occurring after significant time has passed. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
2:11	uy39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֣א	1	The UST supplies a probable location that he **went out** from; it could also have been simply out from the Egyptian area or out to the work area or cities. Use go or come as appropriate in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:11	swn3			מַכֶּ֥ה אִישׁ־עִבְרִ֖י	1	Alternate translation: “hitting a Hebrew” or “beating a Hebrew”
2:12	m9bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	וַ⁠יִּ֤פֶן כֹּה֙ וָ⁠כֹ֔ה	1	These two opposite directions have the combined meaning of “everywhere.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “He looked all around” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
2:12	rmgn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּךְ֙	1	The context makes clear that Moses struck the Egyptian hard enough or repeatedly until Moses killed him. Consider using a word that indicates a deadly blow. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:13	qn45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּצֵא֙	1	See how you translated this in [Exodus 2:11](../02/11.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
2:13	wqrm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֔י	1	The ordinal number here could mean “the next day” (UST) or simply on some day following the events of the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
2:13	rgn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֛ה	1	Here, **behold** shows that Moses was surprised by what he saw. You can use a word in your language that will give this meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
2:13	i4d6			לָֽ⁠רָשָׁ֔ע	1	Based on Moses’ question, this means the aggressor or the man wrongfully attacking his neighbor. Alternate translation: “the man who was guilty of starting the fight”
2:14	qb2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י שָֽׂמְ⁠ךָ֞ לְ⁠אִ֨ישׁ שַׂ֤ר וְ⁠שֹׁפֵט֙ עָלֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	The man is not asking a question, he is using this question to rebuke Moses for intervening in the fight. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are not our leader and have no right to judge us!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:14	k6s5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	הַ⁠לְ⁠הָרְגֵ֨⁠נִי֙ אַתָּ֣ה אֹמֵ֔ר כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָרַ֖גְתָּ אֶת־הַ⁠מִּצְרִ֑י	1	The man used a question here to be sarcastic. Alternate translation: “We know that you killed an Egyptian yesterday. You had better not kill me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
2:14	l62d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠לְ⁠הָרְגֵ֨⁠נִי֙ אַתָּ֣ה אֹמֵ֔ר כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָרַ֖גְתָּ אֶת־הַ⁠מִּצְרִ֑י	1	Again, the man asks a question that is intended to make a statement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Do you think you could kill me without anyone finding out? We know what you did to the Egyptian” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:14	d2ja			הַ⁠לְ⁠הָרְגֵ֨⁠נִי֙ אַתָּ֣ה אֹמֵ֔ר	1	Alternate translation: “Are you planning to kill me” or “Are you threatening to kill me”
2:14	lyqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-aside	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר	1	**Certainly the thing is known** was likely something Moses said to himself, that is, he thought it to himself rather than speaking to the men in front of him. If this would be confusing in your language, you might introduce it as a thought. Alternate translation: “and thought” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
2:14	vfw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר אָכֵ֖ן נוֹדַ֥ע הַ⁠דָּבָֽר	1	It may be clearer to present what was likely a thought Moses had as an indirect quotation. Alternative translation (as indirect quotation): “because he thought that everyone knew what he had done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
2:15	yutr			וַ⁠יְבַקֵּ֖שׁ לַ⁠הֲרֹ֣ג אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֑ה	1	Pharaoh most likely delegated this task. Alternative translation: “and he sought to have Moses killed” (note that the passive form will not work in every language)
2:15	l5rc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י	1	His **face** means his presence. Alternate translation: “from” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:15	otsl			וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב & וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב	1	In Hebrew, these are the same verb. In English, they could be translated as “settle,” which can mean to dwell in a certain place, but it can also mean to lower one’s body into a seated position. This could mean: (1) Moses lived in Midian. He sat by this well one day. This may have been the well for the town he lived in. (2) Moses lived in Midian. His home was by this well. (3) Moses was a wanderer. He was in Midian and sat by this well when the next event occurred.

3:intro	n6ze				0	# Exodus 03 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is one conversation in which Yahweh begins to commission and send Moses to rescue the Israelites.\n\nThis chapter records one of the most important events in the history of the Israelite people: the revelation of the name Yahweh at the burning bush. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### God’s holiness\n\nGod is so holy that people can not look upon him without dying. This is why Moses covered his eyes. It is also why he took off his shoes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Yahweh\n\nThe name Yahweh is the personal name of God, which he revealed to Moses. Yahweh is probably related to the phrase “I am” which he tells Moses in verse 14. Some translations use all capitals to set this apart: “I AM.” Great care must be taken in translating the phrase “I am that I am.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]])\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Participants\n\n“The angel of Yahweh,” “Yahweh,” and “God” all appear to be speaking to Moses and interacting with him from the burning bush. Furthermore, God says that his name is “I AM.” (See note above on Yahweh and I AM.) Yahweh and God are the same, while there is speculation about who the angel of Yahweh is.
3:1	gqvh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וּ⁠מֹשֶׁ֗ה הָיָ֥ה רֹעֶ֛ה	1	This phrase brings the story focus back to Midian and Moses. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

3:1	l7x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	כֹּהֵ֣ן מִדְיָ֑ן	1	This is a possessive of social relationship. **Jethro** is a **priest** who serves the Midianites. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

3:1	p27s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	הַ֥ר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	This is an associative possessive. This mountain was associated with God in some way. In [Exodus 3:12](../03/12.md) God tells Moses that he and the Israelites will serve him on this mountain. Later in the story, this promise is fulfilled, and it is where God makes his covenant with Israel and gives them the 10 Commandments. So it may have been called **the mountain of God** in retrospect (as Moses probably wrote this book sometime after the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness). However, it is possible that the mountain was already somehow associated with God’s presence or worship before Moses went there with the flock. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

He expected the bush to be burnt up completely by the fire. Consider using an interjection in your language that expresses that what follows is a surprise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:2	jmz0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֻכָּֽל	1	Here, **being consumed** means being eaten completely until gone. In the case of fire, this is a metonym for burning completely until gone. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “destroyed by the fire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

It’s not specified who Moses spoke to; he may have been alone or with a group of shepherds or his family. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them.

If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the reason before the commands, as in, “The place on which you are standing, it is holy ground, so you must not come close to here.

The UST continues the quotation from verse 5 rather than including an additional “he said.” This may be more natural in some languages. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate the direct quotation with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:6	l5sy			אָבִ֔י⁠ךָ	1	This could mean (1) “your father,” if it means “your father,” then it refers to Moses’ own father (2) “your ancestor,” if it means “your ancestor,” then the phrases following it clarify who “your father” refers to: it refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In most cases, it will be best to translate it as “your father,” i.e. Amram, Moses’ father.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]] and [Exodus 33:20](../33/20.md))
3:7	nl33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה	1	After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues through the end of [verse 10](../03/10.md).

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:7	xoz0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	רָאֹ֥ה רָאִ֛יתִי	1	The Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. Here, “see” is repeated in Hebrew. This expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having **seen** how his people were suffering. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:7	tpk0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אֶת־עֳנִ֥י עַמִּ֖⁠י	1	There are two possessives here: (1) “affliction of … people”: This is an event-related possessive where the people are the objects of affliction. They are treated badly as slaves. (2) “my people”: This one is more difficult as it involves both ownership and the possessive of social relationship. God views his people as his possession, and he is also in relationship with them as their God because they are descended from Abraham, though at this time they may not know God as theirs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

They agree with “people” as a collective noun in [3:6](../03/06.md). Some languages may have to use plural pronouns. Others may have to match the pronoun’s gender to the grammatical gender of the word for “people” in their language. If necessary, change “him” to “them” or change “his” to “hers” or “its” (depending on grammatical gender of “people.”) Alternate translation: “those who oppress them … their anguish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
3:7	hkcj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1	This is an event-related possessive where the people (as a group: **his**) are the subjects of **anguish.** Your translation should express that they are deeply distressed. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:7	ui28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו	1	It is implied that they are deeply distressed because they are treated badly as slaves.

3:8	djbz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד מִצְרַ֗יִם	1	This is a possessive where the Egyptians are the subject of **the hand**, which means power.

Within each of those, **good** and **wide** are in parallel with each other, and **milk** and **honey**are in parallel with each other. Each of these levels is meant to reinforce and expand upon one another. These are not examples of synonymous parallelism, and each part of the statement should be translated.

3:9	a2kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism		0	This verse parallels [verse 7](../03/07.md). Yahweh is restating that the Israelite’s plight has gotten his attention. This creates emphasis and connection to what Yahweh will do with what Moses will do as Yahweh’s appointed leader. If this repetition would confuse your readers consider a paragraph break at the start of this verse to separate the two parallel statements or use some other strategy of emphasis and connection that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
3:9	tp2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	הִנֵּ֛ה	1	This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “certainly.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
3:9	uup9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	צַעֲקַ֥ת בְּנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בָּ֣אָה אֵלָ֑⁠י	1	Here, **the cry** is spoken of as if it were a person who is capable of moving on his own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “I have heard the cries of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:9	gwou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	רָאִ֨יתִי֙ אֶת־הַ⁠לַּ֔חַץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר מִצְרַ֖יִם לֹחֲצִ֥ים אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **oppression** in another way. Alternate translation: “I have seen how the Egyptians are oppressing them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	y4m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה	1	**And now** functions as a discourse marker expressing logical conclusion. “So then,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:11	y8cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י אָנֹ֔כִי כִּ֥י אֵלֵ֖ךְ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה וְ⁠כִ֥י אוֹצִ֛יא אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִ⁠מִּצְרָֽיִם	1	Moses uses this question to tell God that he, Moses, is not the right person for the task. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:12	xugf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	תַּֽעַבְדוּ⁠ן֙	1	If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
3:13	lqms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	הִנֵּ֨ה אָנֹכִ֣י בָא֮ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵל֒ וְ⁠אָמַרְתִּ֣י לָ⁠הֶ֔ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י אֲבוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֖ם שְׁלָחַ֣⁠נִי אֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם וְ⁠אָֽמְרוּ־לִ֣⁠י מַה־שְּׁמ֔⁠וֹ	1	Moses presents God with a hypothetical situation here. The three events (**go, say, say**) are part of one hypothetical event. You should translate this in a way that makes it clear that this is a future, not-yet-real event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
3:13	jq42			הִנֵּ֨ה	1	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. In this case, Moses uses it to introduce what he views as a probable future occurrence. Alternative translation: “Now”
3:13	e03n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	בָא֮	1	In your language, use **go** or “come” as makes most sense for Moses’ hypothetical action of going from the mountain to where the Israelites are. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
3:13	m9uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֱלֹהֵ֥י אֲבוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֖ם שְׁלָחַ֣⁠נִי אֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	This is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation inside a quotation. However, you may also choose to translate it as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “that the God of their fathers has sent me to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:13	ru0a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֱלֹהֵ֥י אֲבוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Here, **fathers** figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “The God of your ancestors” or “The God whom your ancestors worshiped” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:13	bkei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	מָ֥ה אֹמַ֖ר אֲלֵ⁠הֶֽם	1	Moses is asking God what he should do as a result of the hypothetical situation he presented. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:14	cli8			אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽהְיֶ֑ה	1	This is God’s response to Moses’ question about God’s name. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “God said to Moses, ‘Tell them that God says his name is “I AM THAT I AM.”’”
3:14	b6vk			אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽהְיֶ֑ה	1	This could mean: (1) this whole sentence is God’s name or (2) God is not telling his name but something about himself. By saying this, God is teaching that he is eternal; he has always lived and always will live.
3:14	s62u			אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה & אֶֽהְיֶ֑ה & אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה	1	Languages that do not have an equivalent to the verb “am” may need to render this as “I LIVE” or “I EXIST.”
3:14	t745			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	This indicates that God is still speaking. It may make more sense to omit this in some languages.
3:14	vigc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֶֽהְיֶ֖ה שְׁלָחַ֥⁠נִי אֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	This is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation inside a quotation. However, you may also choose to translate it as an indirect quotation, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:15	ubw7			וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ ע֨וֹד אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה	1	As God is still speaking, it may make more sense to omit this in some languages.
3:15	i6lg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה	1	After this phrase, a direct quotation begins that continues until [the end of chapter 3 at verse 22](../03/22.md). This section contains four levels of quotations as God tells Moses to tell the Israelite elders a specific message from God. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:15	l962		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	יְהוָ֞ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אֱלֹהֵ֨י אַבְרָהָ֜ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֛ק וֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹ֖ב שְׁלָחַ֣⁠נִי אֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם זֶה־שְּׁמִ֣⁠י לְ⁠עֹלָ֔ם וְ⁠זֶ֥ה זִכְרִ֖⁠י לְ⁠דֹ֥ר דֹּֽר	1	This is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. It may be possible to translate it as an indirect quotation, but you will need to be careful to correctly change the pronoun persons. Alternative translation: “You must tell the Israelites that Yahweh, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, sent you to them. This is his name forever, and this is his memorial from generation to generation.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:15	d91k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, **fathers** figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “the God of your ancestors” or “the God whom your ancestors worshiped” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:15	ixcb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	לְ⁠דֹ֥ר דֹּֽר	1	The repetition of **generation** is indicating “to each and every generation” which figuratively means “for all people at all times.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
3:16	ec3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	יְהוָ֞ה	1	# General Information:\n\nThis begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of [verse 17](../03/17.md). It contains a third-level quotation that begins at “I have certainly” and also continues to the end of verse 17. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. The closing marks for both the second and third-level quotations should not occur until the end of verse 17. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:16	usas		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֱלֹהֵ֤י אֲבֹֽתֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	Here, **fathers** figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “the God of your ancestors” or “the God whom your ancestors worshiped” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:16	xqy9			אַבְרָהָ֛ם יִצְחָ֥ק וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were three of the Israelites’ ancestors. They all worshiped the same God.
3:16	dvsz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	פָּקֹ֤ד פָּקַ֨דְתִּי֙	1	This begins a third-level quotation that continues until the end of [verse 17](../03/17.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation that is within a quotation. The closing marks for both the second-level and third-level quotations should not occur until the end of verse 17. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:16	efhh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פָּקֹ֤ד פָּקַ֨דְתִּי֙	1	The word translated **attended** often means God is coming to take action. Translate this phrase in a way that communicates God’s focused, caring observation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:16	p258		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פָּקֹ֤ד פָּקַ֨דְתִּי֙	1	Here, **attended** is repeated in Hebrew. The Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. This expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having **attended to** how his people were suffering. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:16	fv77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The word **you** refers to the people of Israel. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
3:16	q4en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֶ⁠עָשׂ֥וּי	1	The focus of this passive is the mistreatment being **done to** the Israelites, not on who is doing it. In fact, **in Egypt** further dissociates the actors from this sentence. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:16	johw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠מִצְרָֽיִם	1	The phrase **in Egypt** is a metonym for the Egyptian oppressors. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “by the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:17	eloj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks		0	If you are using direct quotations, at the end of this verse you should have three closing markers. In English, it looks like ’ ” ’ (without spaces). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:17	c54k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אַעֲלֶ֣ה אֶתְ⁠כֶם֮ מֵ⁠עֳנִ֣י מִצְרַיִם֒ אֶל־אֶ֤רֶץ הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִי֙ וְ⁠הַ֣⁠חִתִּ֔י וְ⁠הָֽ⁠אֱמֹרִי֙ וְ⁠הַ⁠פְּרִזִּ֔י וְ⁠הַ⁠חִוִּ֖י וְ⁠הַ⁠יְבוּסִ֑י אֶל־אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1	This is a fourth-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer three levels. Alternatively, it can be translated as an indirect quotation, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:17	r8mg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַעֲלֶ֣ה	1	Regardless of the geographic realities, to **bring up** does not primarily have a literal meaning. Rather, it means to bring the Israelites into a better situation. God promised to bring them up from their low status as slaves to a place where they would be the masters of a good land. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:17	x1o0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מֵ⁠עֳנִ֣י	1	See how you translated **affliction** in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “from being afflicted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:17	wyvt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1	Here, **milk** is a metonym for domestic animals and the food products obtained from them; **honey** is a metonym for the food obtained from growing plants. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. The next note explains further. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:17	pwn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1	God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. See how you translated this in [Exodus 3:8](../03/08.md). Alternate translation: “a land that is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops” or “a land where milk and honey flow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:17	za9l			זָבַ֥ת	1	Alternate translation: “full of” or “with an abundance of”
3:17	rtr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חָלָ֖ב	1	Since milk comes from cows and goats, this represents food produced by livestock. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “food from livestock” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:17	msf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1	Since honey is produced from flowers, this represents food from crops. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “food from crops” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:18	cy2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠שָׁמְע֖וּ לְ⁠קֹלֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	**Listen** often means “hear and do/obey.” If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language. Alternative translation: “And they will pay attention to your voice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:18	j24k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לְ⁠קֹלֶ֑⁠ךָ & אַתָּה֩	1	Here, **your** and **you** refers to Moses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:18	w742		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠קֹלֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	This phrase means the elders will listen to the message Moses brings from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “to your message” or “to my message which you tell them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
3:18	r74o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠זִקְנֵ֨י יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל	1	This is a possessive of social relationship. Alternative translation: “elders in charge of the Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:18	eep7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵ֜ל	1	**Israel** is a collective noun that refers to all the Israelites. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternative translation: “the Israelites” or “the Israelite people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
3:18	ot9r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִצְרַ֗יִם	1	Here, **Egypt** refers to the Egyptian nation. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:18	idp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וַ⁠אֲמַרְתֶּ֤ם	1	# General Information:\n\nIf your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
3:18	i47o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	עָלֵ֔י⁠נוּ & נֵֽלֲכָה & וְ⁠נִזְבְּחָ֖ה	1	These instances of **us** are exclusive; they include Moses, the elders, and all the Israelites, but exclude the king of Egypt. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:18	d85b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	שְׁלֹ֤שֶׁת	1	Alternate translation: “3” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
3:19	qf46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹ֖א בְּ⁠יָ֥ד חֲזָקָֽה	1	The word **hand** is a metonym for the power of the owner of the hand. There are two further difficulties: (1) Whose hand (power) is being referred to, (2) does the negative mean “not unless” or “not even?” Possible meanings include: (1) “only if he sees that he has no power to do anything else,” where the **hand** belongs to Pharaoh (2) “only if I force him to let you go,” where the **hand** belongs to Yahweh, taking “not unless” for the negative (3) “not even if I force him to let you go,” where the **hand** belongs to Yahweh, taking “not even” for the negative (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:20	nuzx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠שָׁלַחְתִּ֤י	1	God says this will be a result of the king of Egypt’s stubbornness. Alternate translation: “Therefore, I will send out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:20	yds5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠שָׁלַחְתִּ֤י אֶת־יָדִ⁠י֙	1	Here, **hand** refers to God’s power. Alternate translation: “I will use my strength” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:20	dzsp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	**Egypt** refers to both the land and the people group, and then, by extension, to Pharaoh as well. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:20	c9a3			מִצְרַ֔יִם & בְּ⁠קִרְבּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Here, **him** refers to Egypt as a collective.
3:20	g0i9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	נִפְלְאֹתַ֔⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **wonders** in another way.

3:20	sqmt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי־כֵ֖ן	1	Here the sequential nature of these happenings is emphasized. Consider using a stronger sequential connective term than usual here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
3:20	ay53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְשַׁלַּ֥ח	1	Here, **he** refers to the Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:20	awxs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶֽם	1	Here, **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
3:21	btwc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	חֵ֥ן & בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	**In the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings. **Favor** means those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites (Hebrews) leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them (because they want them to leave so badly due to the Egyptians suffering under God’s judgment). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:21	hfrr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	This is a part-whole possessive. Also, if your language uses a specific form of the possessive for things one cannot lose, it would be appropriate to use that form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:21	s45u			הָֽ⁠עָם־הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה	1	Alternate translation: “you”
3:21	uz3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	תֵֽלֵכ֔וּ⁠ן & תֵלְכ֖וּ	1	If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
3:21	wymx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	תֵֽלֵכ֔וּ⁠ן & תֵלְכ֖וּ	1	Alternate translation: “leave” or “go out” or “come out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
3:21	j9qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֥א & רֵיקָֽם	1	The double negative, **not … emptily** is used to mean “full.” If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “[go] with many things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
3:21	kt7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	לֹ֥א תֵלְכ֖וּ רֵיקָֽם	1	Here Yahweh uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “you will go with your hands full of good things” or “you will go with many valuable things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
3:22	w2av			וּ⁠מִ⁠גָּרַ֣ת בֵּיתָ֔⁠הּ	1	The word, **sojourning** means living somewhere other than one’s native land, usually temporarily. It is unclear both who the sojourning (visiting) women are and in whose house they are sojourning, leaving several possibilities. Most translations which make a decision about who they are identify both the temporary resident and her host home as Egyptian. This makes sense as the Israelites will be plundering the Egyptians. If it is possible to leave this ambiguous in your translation, that would be best.
3:22	fmfu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וְ⁠שַׂמְתֶּ֗ם עַל־בְּנֵי⁠כֶם֙ וְ⁠עַל־בְּנֹ֣תֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וְ⁠נִצַּלְתֶּ֖ם	1	Each of these is a plural **you.** If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
3:22	h38j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	מִצְרָֽיִם	1	After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh’s word which started in [verse 15](../03/15.md) ends. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])* Yahweh’s instructions to Moses are complex, and there are up to four levels of quotations in this chapter. Translators will need to decide if some of these need to become indirect quotations (if that is possible in their language) and take great care to use the proper quotation markings in the proper locations.\n\n### Order of events\n\n* The order of events is not always clear. In [4:14](../04/14.md) Yahweh tells Moses that Aaron is coming to meet him, but Yahweh telling Aaron to go meet Moses in the wilderness is not recorded until [4:27](../04/27.md).\n* The timing of the events in [4:18](../18/.md)\\-[4:27](../04/27.md), especially verses 18-19 and 27 in relation to the rest of the events of the chapter, is unclear.\n\n### Thus says Yahweh\n\nThe first of over 400 occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh occurs in [4:22](../04/22.md). It occurs ten times in the book of Exodus; nine of these are between chapters 4–11. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your leader that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the leader, that would be a good phrase to consider.\n\n### Yahweh’s attempt to kill someone\n\nThe encounter recorded from [4:24](../04/24.md) to [4:26](../04/26.md) is one of the strangest and most difficult passages in the entire book. Difficulties include:\n\n* To whom do the pronouns refer? Masculine pronouns are used throughout the section, but there are two possible antecedents, Moses (who is not named in the narrative) and Zipporah’s son (who was presumably also Moses’ son, but this is how he is referred to in this text. For why, see below on why Yahweh did this). Most commentators believe the pronouns refer to Moses.\n* Circumcision is described in fairly graphic detail. Different cultures will need to approach this differently. Some may have terms for circumcision, while others may be comfortable translating mostly literally, and others will need to use euphemisms or other strategies to translate. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n* The meaning of the phrase **a bridegroom of blood** (ULT) is unknown.\n* Why did Yahweh attack Moses? Many commentators conclude that Moses had neglected to circumcise one of his sons because it displeased Zipporah, and Yahweh was holding Moses responsible before he returned to lead the Israelites (who should have been circumcised). When Zipporah repented by circumcising the son herself and touching the foreskin to Moses’ feet, Yahweh relents. These conclusions should help inform translation but should not be made explicit in the text.\n\n## Study Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Children of God\n\nThis chapter introduces the concept that Israel, the people group, is the chosen people of God and God’s firstborn son. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/elect]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/firstborn]])\n\n### Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart\n\nScholars are divided over how to understand this statement. There is debate over how Pharaoh has an active or passive role in the hardening of his own heart. Translators should simply follow the text. In Exodus 4-14 there are ten statements that Yahweh hardens Pharaoh’s heart, and ten statements that Pharaoh hardens his own heart. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:1	j4yg			וַ⁠יַּ֤עַן מֹשֶׁה֙ וַ⁠יֹּ֔אמֶר	1	Here, **answered and said** is a Hebrew expression which does not convey any extra information. Unless your language naturally uses a similar structure, it is better to translate one verb and omit the other. Alternate translation: “Moses answered”
4:1	b3xv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	וְ⁠הֵן֙ לֹֽא־יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ לִ֔⁠י וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִשְׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י כִּ֣י יֹֽאמְר֔וּ לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהוָֽה	1	This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation.There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:1	pq8x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י	1	See [3:18](../03/18.md). Alternate translation: “to what I say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:1	neto		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהוָֽה	1	This is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you could translate it as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh has not appeared to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:1	fu2x			וְ⁠הֵן֙	1	This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “Listen to me.”
4:2	qmvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֵלָ֛י⁠ו & וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	Here, **him** and **he** refer to Moses. Alternate translation: “to Moses … And Moses said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:3	zycd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פָּנָֽי⁠ו	1	Here, “face” figuratively represents the snake itself. Alternative translation: “from the snake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:4	g6bk			וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: “and pick it up by the tail” or “and grasp it by the tail”
4:4	bzmp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	שְׁלַח֙ יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ	1	This direct quotation is interrupted by Moses obeying Yahweh. This is probably a tightly ordered sequence of events where Yahweh paused and then continued speaking immediately after Moses obeyed. The quote resumes in [verse 5](../04/05.md), and there is more discussion there about how to translate the quotation resumption. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
4:4	m86n			וַ⁠יְהִ֥י לְ⁠מַטֶּ֖ה	1	Alternate translation: “and it turned into a rod” or “and it changed into a staff”
4:5	l4tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	לְמַ֣עַן יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ כִּֽי־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֖ק וֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1	This continues the direct quotation from the first part of [verse 4](../04/04.md). It may be more natural to reorganize verses four and five to keep the quote together. If you rearrange like this, Moses picking up the snake/staff should come after the full quotation. However, it is better to do something similar to the UST, which restates that Yahweh is speaking and provides some implied directives from Yahweh to make a complete sentence. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:5	m4fk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לְמַ֣עַן יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ כִּֽי־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֖ק וֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1	This quote is not a complete sentence; the UST provides a clarification. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:5	zbfr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ & אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, **them** and **their** refer either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is a better option. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:5	oqi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **you** refers to Moses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

4:6	ep52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	This word, **behold**, is used to create an exclamation, showing surprise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
4:6	pw7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠שָּֽׁלֶג	1	The word **like** (ULT) or “as” (UST) here is used to compare how Moses’ hand looked. You may not have a word for snow in your language. If so, consider an alternative that describes something very white. You may need to make the whiteness explicit. Alternate translation: “that made it look white like wool” or “that made it look white like the sand on the beach” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
4:7	prr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	This word is used to create an exclamation, showing surprise. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way that makes explicit that the signs are meant to be proof that God sent Moses. Alternative translation: “and are not convinced that God has appeared to you by seeing the first sign, then they will be convinced by seeing the second sign.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
4:8	gxlg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ & יִשְׁמְע֔וּ & וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ	1	Here, **they** refers either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is the better option, but be sure to do the same as you did in [verse 5](../04/05.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:8	lsb3			לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֣ינוּ & וְ⁠הֶֽאֱמִ֔ינוּ	1	Alternate translation: “they do not acknowledge … then they will acknowledge” or “they do not accept … then they will accept”
4:9	q82r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַאֲמִ֡ינוּ & יִשְׁמְעוּ⁠ן֙	1	Here, **they** refers either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is the better option, but be sure to do the same as you did in [verse 5](../04/05.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:9	jsvb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠קֹלֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	See [3:18](../03/18.md). Alternate translation: “to what you say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:10	t8i9			בִּ֣י	1	This word is used by a speaker to beg a superior to allow him to speak. Alternate translation: “Please”
4:10	w12a			לֹא֩ אִ֨ישׁ דְּבָרִ֜ים אָנֹ֗כִי גַּ֤ם מִ⁠תְּמוֹל֙ גַּ֣ם מִ⁠שִּׁלְשֹׁ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: “I have never been an excellent speaker, not now, not before”
4:10	opes			אִ֨ישׁ דְּבָרִ֜ים	1	This expression means “a man who uses words well,” in other words, an eloquent man who can speak well and convincingly.
4:10	pk0l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	גַּ֤ם מִ⁠תְּמוֹל֙ גַּ֣ם מִ⁠שִּׁלְשֹׁ֔ם	1	These phrases simply mean “in the past.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
4:10	wsl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עַבְדֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	Moses refers to himself as God’s servant to lower his status before God (and perhaps by doing so to make his argument of inability stronger). If this is confusing in your language, you can make who he means plain. Alternate translation: “me, your servant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
4:10	bv64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כְבַד־פֶּ֛ה וּ⁠כְבַ֥ד לָשׁ֖וֹן	1	These phrases mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize that he is not a good speaker. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “not good at public speaking”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:10	zm3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לָשׁ֖וֹן	1	Here, **tongue** refers to Moses’ ability to speak. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “speech” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:11	ks2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י שָׂ֣ם פֶּה֮ לָֽ⁠אָדָם֒	1	Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the Creator who makes it possible for people to speak. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Is it not I, Yahweh, who created the human mouth and the ability to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:11	e1y6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יָשׂ֣וּם אִלֵּ֔ם א֣וֹ חֵרֵ֔שׁ א֥וֹ פִקֵּ֖חַ א֣וֹ עִוֵּ֑ר	1	Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he is the one who decides if people can speak and hear, and if they can see. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “make people able to speak or hear or to see or to be blind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:11	uq7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֥א אָנֹכִ֖י יְהוָֽה	1	Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he alone makes these decisions. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, am the one who does this!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:12	kkr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אָנֹכִי֙ אֶֽהְיֶ֣ה עִם־פִּ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **mouth** refers to Moses’ ability to speak. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “I will give you the ability to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:13	brer			בִּ֣י	1	This word is used by a speaker to beg a superior to allow him to speak. See what you did in [verse 10](../04/10.md). Alternate translation: “Please”
4:13	s8nl			שְֽׁלַֽח־נָ֖א בְּ⁠יַד־תִּשְׁלָֽח	1	In translating this phrase, it is important to make clear that Moses is asking Yahweh to send someone else. Here he is not accepting Yahweh’s commission.
4:13	y4a7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠יַד	1	This phrase means “by a person.” The figure is of a person taking Yahweh’s message in his hand to the Israelites and Pharaoh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:14	uy2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר־אַ֨ף יְהוָ֜ה	1	This means that Yahweh is angry. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Yahweh became angry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:14	ifax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Here, **he** refers to Yahweh. Alternate translation: “and Yahweh said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:14	okko		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֨א אַהֲרֹ֤ן אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ הַ⁠לֵּוִ֔י	1	Yahweh uses this rhetorical question to suggest an alternative to Moses. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternative translation: “I know you have a brother, Aaron the Levite.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:14	e0js		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Aaron is older than Moses. If your language uses a different term for the sibling relationship based on gender and age order, choose the appropriate one. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
4:14	y5ed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	דַבֵּ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר	1	In Hebrew, the word **speak** is repeated. This means he speaks well. English cannot convey this by doubling, so the meaning of the repetition was translated in the ULT in this case. If your language can say something like “speaking speaks” to mean “speaks well,” consider it; otherwise, translate the meaning similarly to the ULT or UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:14	c51y			הִנֵּה	1	Here, **behold** is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. If your language has a term that functions in that way (“Listen!” or “Look!” or “Pay Attention!”), use it here.
4:14	ettp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	יֹצֵ֣א	1	Yahweh says Aaron is coming from Egypt to Midian to find Moses. He is probably on foot. Depending on the language, the required form of go or come may vary. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
4:14	tfsa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠שָׂמַ֥ח	1	Aaron will be glad because he sees Moses. Consider a conjunction or other form that expresses result, as in the UST or alternative translation: “and because he sees you, he will have joy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:14	ew4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠לִבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **heart** refers to inner thoughts and emotions. If the heart is not a body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s thoughts and emotions, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:15	u97f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֖ים	1	Words here are spoken of as if they were something that can be physically placed in a person’s mouth. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the message that he is to repeat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:15	q9cf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֗י אֶֽהְיֶ֤ה עִם־פִּ֨י⁠ךָ֙ וְ⁠עִם־פִּ֔י⁠הוּ	1	The word **mouth** here represents Moses’ and Aaron’s choice of words. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “And I will be with you as you speak and with him as he speaks” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:15	v57x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם & תַּעֲשֽׂוּ⁠ן	1	These refer to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form if you have one or, if not, use a plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
4:16	mnsp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	לְ⁠פֶ֔ה	1	This phrase compares Aaron to a mouth because he will be the one to actually vocalize to the Israelites and Pharaoh what Moses tells him to say. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the one to say what you tell him to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
4:16	gn5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	תִּֽהְיֶה־לּ֥⁠וֹ לֵֽ⁠אלֹהִֽים	1	The word **like** here means Moses would represent the same authority to Aaron as God did to Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “you will speak to Aaron with the same authority with which I speak to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
4:17	hm47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠מַּטֶּ֥ה הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה	1	Yahweh assumes that Moses will know that by **this staff**, he means the one that Moses said he had in his hand in [verse 2](../04/02.md) and with which God told him to do a miracle in [verses 3-4](../04/03.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:18	j2ix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	יֶ֣תֶר	1	Jethro is reintroduced as a participant in the narrative here. Use the natural form in your language for reintroducing a character.(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
4:18	cbop		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּ֨לֶךְ	1	Because the setting has shifted back to Jethro’s home, some languages may need to use “come” here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
4:18	b6mf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	חֹֽתְנ֗⁠וֹ	1	This refers to the father of Moses’ wife. If your language uses a different term for the husband’s or wife’s father use the one for wife’s father. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
4:18	wlit		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1	Here, **he** refers to Moses. Alternate translation: “and Moses said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:18	g1h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ל⁠וֹ֙	1	Here, **him** refers to Jethro. Alternate translation: “to Jethro” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:18	urt0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַחַ֣⁠י	1	Here the term **brothers** refers more broadly to all of Moses’ people group, those he is related to. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “my relatives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:18	gq2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֶרְאֶ֖ה הַ⁠עוֹדָ֣⁠ם חַיִּ֑ים	1	Later in the Bible we are told that Moses was in Midian for 40 years. Moses’ request may have been literal or an idiom that meant he wanted to know how they were doing. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:18	yay3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	לֵ֥ךְ לְ⁠שָׁלֽוֹם	1	This is a phrase of assent and blessing. It may be necessary for some languages to explicitly add, “Yes,” to the beginning of Jethro’s response. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
4:19	wwr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֤ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֙	1	The timing and situation for Yahweh speaking to Moses here is not specified. Some conjecture that it was part of the narrative of the encounter with Yahweh from the previous verses but placed after his request to Jethro for an unknown reason. Another speculation is that Moses delayed returning to Egypt (either by his own choice, Yahweh’s instructions, or someone else delaying him) and Yahweh came and told him again (the UST explicitly offers this optional translation). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
4:19	clfj			הַֽ⁠מְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת־נַפְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	This means they were seeking to end his life, that is, to kill him.
4:20	fua6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	בָּנָ֗י⁠ו	1	Moses’ second son is not introduced until [18:4](../18/.04.md) but had already been born before they left Midian. It is not necessary to make this explicit here, if it would confuse your readers you could add a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:20	zi5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	It is clear from [verse 24](../04/24.md) and [25](../04/25.md) that Moses’ family went with him. If this is confusing in your language, you may need to change from **he** to “they” **returned**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
4:20	a1s5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	After the incident on the road in verses [24-26](../04/24.md). Moses’ family is not mentioned again until [18:2](../18/02.md), which says that Moses sent them back, so it may be better to make a translation similar to the UST, which only commits to the family starting on the way to Egypt. This option has the further benefit of allowing for the several events that happen before Moses gets to Egypt. The ULT’s **toward** is another way of giving space in the translation for the next several events. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
4:20	f26l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	The phrase **the staff of God** refers to the staff that God told Moses to take with him in [verse 17](../04/17.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:20	m4uj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	The book describes this staff as **the staff of God** because God appointed it as his instrument so that Moses could do miraculous works through it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Make sure your translation does not lead people to think the staff was a magic wand or shaman’s staff that had its own power or power from Moses or that the staff gave Moses the ability to command God. In every instance where miracles happened, first God told Moses to do something with the staff, then Moses obeyed, and then God caused a miracle. Alternate translation: “the staff that God had told him to bring because God intended to work powerfully through it when Moses stretched it out.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:21	lva8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	בְּ⁠לֶכְתְּ⁠ךָ֙	1	This begins a direct quotation that continues to the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It contains up to fourth-level quotations. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:21	oajf			רְאֵ֗ה	1	Most translations and interpretations of the verb **see** take it to mean something like “see that you do.”
4:21	paos		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כָּל־הַ⁠מֹּֽפְתִים֙ אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֣מְתִּי בְ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Here the miracles are spoken of as if they were items Moses could carry. In part, this may be because the three signs already given to Moses involved the use of his hand. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “all the wonders I have authorized you to perform” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:21	kdsb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה	1	This time, while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses is to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so he can see them. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:21	ovma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק	1	Referring to himself in the opening of this sentence serves to emphasize a contrast between what might normally be expected and what will actually happen. Translate this in a way that clearly contrasts the performance of miracles before Pharaoh (which might be expected to lead to him releasing the Israelites) with what Yahweh says Pharaoh will do. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:21	uvoh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	This means that God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart would be made stronger. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. Alternate translation: “But as for me, I will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:21	uudz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־הָ⁠עָֽם	1	Make it clear in your translation that this is a result of God hardening Pharaoh’s heart. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:22	ftde			כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	This is the first of hundreds of occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase, **Thus says Yahweh**, used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your rulers that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the rulers, that would be a good phrase to consider.
4:22	teyy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	This begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “that Yahweh says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:22	kud7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	בְּנִ֥⁠י בְכֹרִ֖⁠י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃	1	This is the beginning of a third-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. (If you chose to translate, “Thus says Yahweh,” as an indirect quote, this will be a second- level quotation.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:22	gr2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנִ֥⁠י	1	Yahweh expresses his affection for the Israelites by calling them his **son**. Some languages may need to change the metaphor here into a simile. See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:22	pt4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The word **Israel** here represents all the people of Israel as a group. It is important to keep the singular reference to Israel as son rather than change it to something like ‘the Israelites are my children,’ because God is making a particular contrast here between his son and Pharaoh’s son. Some languages may not be able to use “Israel” as a collective noun and may need to choose a translation like “the nation of Israel” or “the Israelite nation.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
4:22	nbn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The Israelite nation is often referred to simply by the name of the patriarch. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “The Israelites are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:23	syar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי	1	This is a fourth-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. (If you chose to translate “Thus says Yahweh” as an indirect quote, this will be a third-level quotation.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:23	yyuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וָ⁠אֹמַ֣ר אֵלֶ֗י⁠ךָ שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי וַ⁠תְּמָאֵ֖ן	1	The fourth-level quotation here may be a good one to translate as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “and I told you to let my son go that he may serve me. But you have refused” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
4:23	k7mh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנִ⁠י֙	1	Yahweh continues to metaphorically speak of Israel as **my son.** See how you translated it in the previous verse. Alternative translation: “the Israelite nation, which is like a son to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:23	u825		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי & לְ⁠שַׁלְּח֑⁠וֹ	1	The pronouns **he** and **him** agree with “son.” What you use may depend on how you translated son in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
4:23	ot2b			הִנֵּה֙	1	This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Know this”
4:23	re11			בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖	1	Here, **your son** refers to the actual son of Pharaoh.
4:23	ubcw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖ בְּכֹרֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	After this phrase, the three levels of direct quotations end, bringing a complete close to all quotations that started in verses [21](../04/21.md) and [22](../04/22.md). If you are using direct quotations, at the end of this verse you should have three closing markers: third level, second level and first level. In English, it looks like **” ’ ”** (without spaces). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:24	sp6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֥י	1	This introduces a new event. Mark the transition in a natural way in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
4:24	p820		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּפְגְּשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ & הֲמִיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, it is not clear who **him** refers to. Most commentators believe it refers to Moses, but it could refer to the son, though that is less likely. If it is necessary to choose for your translation, use Moses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:24	qeo5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְבַקֵּ֖שׁ	1	Here, **he** refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:25	m1la		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	צִפֹּרָ֜ה	1	**Zipporah** is the name of Moses’ wife. See how you translated it in [2:21](../02/21.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:25	sftg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	צִפֹּרָ֜ה	1	**Zipporah** is introduced here as a new character. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
4:25	a36h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	צֹ֗ר	1	This was a flake or a sharp piece of a hard gray rock that was used as a knife.. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:25	nkxn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עָרְלַ֣ת	1	The**foreskin** is the retractable fold of skin which covers and protects the end of the penis. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:25	l6sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	לְ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	It is possible that the word **feet** may have been a more respectful way to refer to the genital area of the body. However, that possibility is not high enough that you should translate it either literally as genitals or with another euphemism meaning genitals in your language. If you have a word that means primarily feet or legs, but could in some cases also euphemistically mean genitals, you may consider it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
4:25	b2t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽ⁠י	1	The meaning of this metaphor is unclear. It was probably a known saying in that culture. Alternate translation: “You are related to me by this blood” or “You are my husband because of blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:26	ceqk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּ֖רֶף	1	God **relented** as a result of Zipporah’s action. Consider a conjunction or other form that expresses result, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:26	o4zt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּ֖רֶף	1	Here, **he** refers to Yahweh. Alternate translation: “Yahweh relented” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:26	k136		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	As in [4:24](../04/24.md), **him** could refer to either Moses or the son, but most commentators think it is still Moses. The UST uses “anyone” to preserve ambiguity. Alternative translation: “from Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:26	r8hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים	1	This is a unique quotation because Zipporah probably does not speak again; rather, the quotation refers back to her statement in [4:25](../04/25.md). Use a form from your language for quoting a portion of what someone previously said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
4:26	abmg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים לַ⁠מּוּלֹֽת	1	It is not clear if the quotation includes **because of the circumcision** or if that is a comment explaining the quotation. Translations are divided in where they end the quotation, but most exclude **because of the circumcision**, and it is best to follow that unless a locally respected translation includes it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:27	xk6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1	You may want to add a word that marks the beginning of a new part of the story, as the UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
4:27	qxpc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אַהֲרֹ֔ן	1	**Aaron** is introduced as a new participant. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
4:27	wy4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠הַ֥ר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	See how you translated this in [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:27	tfn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּשַּׁק	1	This was a traditional way of greeting which showed love. You can make this explicit, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
4:28	ad9x			שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ & צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ	1	These are a bit awkward to translate in English, so the UST adds more information. Other languages may not have the same difficulty.
4:28	b429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ & צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ	1	Here, the pronoun **he** refers to Yahweh, and **him** refers to Moses. Alternative translation: “Yahweh sent Moses … Yahweh commanded Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:29	y8o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ	1	This begins a new event which you may need to mark in your translation with a transitional word like the UST’s “When.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
4:30	bm2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י הָ⁠עָֽם	1	Here, **before the eyes** means he did the signs so they could see them. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “in their sight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:30	x1v3			הָ⁠עָֽם	1	Context suggests that **people** refers to the leaders gathered in [4:29](../04/29.md).
4:31	glp2			הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1	Context suggests that **people** refers to the leaders gathered in [4:29](../04/29.md).
4:31	q1er			פָקַ֨ד & בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	Alternate translation: “saw the Israelites” or “was concerned about the Israelites”
4:31	g83a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַֽ⁠יִּקְּד֖וּ וַ⁠יִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוּֽוּ	1	This action was an expression of thankful worship. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternative translations: “they bowed their heads in awe” or “they bowed down low in reverence.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
5:intro	kea2				0	# Exodus 05 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- v. 1-5: Moses gives Pharaoh Yahweh’s message\n- v. 6-21: Pharaoh makes the Israelites work harder\n- v. 22-23: Moses asks Yahweh why things went badly

Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternative translation: “After that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
5:1	q9kn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וְ⁠אַחַ֗ר בָּ֚אוּ מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֔ן וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֖וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	It is unclear how long Moses and Aaron waited before they went to see Pharaoh. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
5:1	cudx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	בָּ֚אוּ	1	In this instance, depending on how they have to set scenes, some languages may need to use “came in.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
5:1	tsnv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	Pharaoh is reintroduced as a participant in the narrative for the first time since chapter two. Use the natural form in your language for reintroducing a character. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
5:1	jarm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל שַׁלַּח֙ אֶת־עַמִּ֔⁠י וְ⁠יָחֹ֥גּוּ לִ֖⁠י בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּֽר	1	This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. There is a second-level quotation fully contained within this portion which is addressed elsewhere. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
5:1	lu3i			כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1	This quotation formula is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
5:1	u2vt			וְ⁠יָחֹ֥גּוּ	1	This is a celebration to worship Yahweh. Alternative translation: “so they can worship me with eating and drinking”
5:2	v4c1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	The result here is exactly as God has said; therefore, a contrastive transition word is reasonable but not required, given the immediate human context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:2	lqwt			מִ֤י יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶשְׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	This is not a rhetorical question, though Pharaoh may have spoken with contempt. Pharaoh would have considered himself a god. The Egyptians had several gods, and most people groups were assumed to have their own gods. Therefore, Pharaoh had truly not heard of Yahweh (who has just revealed his name to Moses).
5:2	wpff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל & יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	Here the nation is spoken of as an individual. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternative translation: “the nation of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
5:2	c653		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ	1	Here, **his voice** represent the words God spoke. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “to what he says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:2	ma6b			וְ⁠גַ֥ם	1	This functions to strengthen Pharaoh’s statement about his decision. Alternative translation: “and most definitely”
5:3	dt39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ	1	It may not make sense in all languages for multiple people to speak. Since Aaron was appointed as Moses’ spokesman, consider the alternative translation: “Aaron replied” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
5:3	y9ip			אֱלֹהֵ֥י הָ⁠עִבְרִ֖ים	1	This term, **The God of the Hebrews**, is also used for Yahweh, the Israelites’ God.
5:3	kclj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	עָלֵ֑י⁠נוּ נֵ֣לֲכָה & וְ⁠נִזְבְּחָה֙ & יִפְגָּעֵ֔⁠נוּ	1	Here, **us** (or “we” in UST) refers to the Hebrew people (the Israelites). It excludes Pharaoh and his people. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:3	gfs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֶ⁠חָֽרֶב	1	Here, **sword** represents war or an attack by enemies. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “cause our enemies to attack us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:4	kl1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֚⁠מָּה מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֔ן תַּפְרִ֥יעוּ אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֖ם מִ⁠מַּֽעֲשָׂ֑י⁠ו	1	Pharaoh uses this rhetorical question to express his anger toward Moses and Aaron for taking the Israelites away from their work. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Stop distracting the people from doing their work!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:4	fiw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	לְכ֖וּ לְ⁠סִבְלֹתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	This **your** could refer to Moses and Aaron, or it could mean “all you Israelite people.” The second meaning is more likely. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
5:5	xm4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	It is unusual for the same speaker to be reintroduced like this. Some translations omit the repetition, but there is another option. This statement may be more connected to the next couple of verses, so it might be appropriate to make a minor break before this verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:5	nqbe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-aside	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֔ה הֵן־רַבִּ֥ים עַתָּ֖ה עַ֣ם הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠הִשְׁבַּתֶּ֥ם אֹתָ֖⁠ם מִ⁠סִּבְלֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	This statement by Pharaoh may have been him commenting to himself, or he may have only thought this statement silently; either way, it led to his next actions. If this would be confusing in your language, consider stating it in a way that clarifies that his statement or thoughts here impacted his next actions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
5:5	todi			הֵן	1	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say.
5:5	c53k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וְ⁠הִשְׁבַּתֶּ֥ם	1	Here, **you** means Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form if you have one, or if not, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
5:6	ar9m			וַ⁠יְצַ֥ו פַּרְעֹ֖ה & אֶת־הַ⁠נֹּגְשִׂ֣ים בָּ⁠עָ֔ם וְ⁠אֶת־שֹׁטְרָ֖י⁠ו לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	Pharaoh may have sent a messenger or messengers to the taskmasters and officers or spoken to one or a few representatives of them at his court rather than speaking to them directly. Alternative translation: “And … Pharaoh gave an order to the taskmasters among the people and officers. He said,”
5:6	zd4m			הַ⁠נֹּגְשִׂ֣ים	1	**Taskmasters** were Egyptians whose job it was to force the Israelites to do hard work. These are probably the same as the “overseers” of labor gangs from [Exodus 1:11](../01/11.md), but here the term is harsher. Alternative translation: “oppressors”
5:6	gsdx			שֹׁטְרָ֖י⁠ו	1	**Officers** were probably Israelite slaves who were in charge of the other Israelites but who answered to the Egyptian taskmasters.
5:6	dxih			לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	Here, **saying** is a way of introducing a direct quotation in Hebrew; most translations can omit it without harm.
5:7	k6io		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	לֹ֣א תֹאסִפ֞וּ⁠ן	1	This command was given to multiple people; if your language distinguishes between singular and plural forms when giving commands, make sure this is a plural form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
5:7	p9nx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּ⁠תְמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֑ם	1	This is a Hebrew idiom meaning “in the past.” If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

Rather, he had commanded his servants to take straw that belonged to Pharaoh and give it to the Israelites. Now he told his servants to stop providing straw.

By explicitly using a pronoun with a command, he is emphasizing who will go get straw. If possible, translate this in a way that emphasizes the contrast between **I** and **you.** See the previous verse. Alternative translation: “Rather, it is you yourselves who must go get straw from wherever you might find it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

5:18	z6wt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	לָ⁠כֶ֑ם & תִּתֵּֽנּוּ	1	Here, **you** means all the Israelites or the officers as representatives of all the Israelites.

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “you have caused Pharaoh and his servants to hate us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:21	d592		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חֶ֥רֶב בְּ⁠יָדָ֖⁠ם	1	Here, **a sword into their hand** is a metonym for “a reason in their mind.” The Israelites are afraid that the Egyptians will feel that they are doing the right thing if they kill the Israelites, because Moses and Aaron are making demands to the king and because the Egyptians view the Israelites as lazy and dangerous. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “them a reason to think they would be right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:22	g4d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֥⁠מָּה זֶּ֖ה שְׁלַחְתָּֽ⁠נִי	1	This question shows how disappointed Moses was that the Egyptians were treating the Israelites even more harshly now.

6:intro	we5k				0	# Exodus 06 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- v. 1-13, 28-30: Yahweh repeats his commissioning of Moses after the bad events recorded in chapter 5\n- v. 14-27: Genealogy of Moses and Aaron\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Repetition of events:\n\nMost of the content of this chapter is very similar to the events and dialogue in chapters 3-4. For consistency, translators should consult the decisions they made there while keeping in mind that this narrative is not exactly the same. Also, verses 10-12 and verses 28-30 are very similar to each other. These events are probably a recommissioning of Moses. After his first encounter with Pharaoh went very poorly and the Israelites seem to reject God, Yahweh reminds Moses of his promises and power.\n\n### Referring to God\n\nA name for God (**Yahweh**) and a title for God (**El Shaddai**) are mentioned in this chapter ([6:2](../06/02.md)\\-[6:3](../06/03.md)). The precise meaning of El Shaddai is not known, but most scholars think it means something like “almighty.” Translators who have worked on Genesis may find confusing the statement that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not know Yahweh as the name of God.\n\n### Other possible translation difficulties:\n\nWith little explanation, a large portion of the chapter is devoted to the genealogy of Moses and Aaron. Some of the people in the genealogy lived much longer than is normal for humans today. If translators are not familiar with the lengths of people’s lives in the early days of the world (as recorded in Genesis, especially chapter 5), this may cause confusion.\n\n## Study Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Promised Land\n\nAccording to the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham, Egypt is not the home of the Hebrew people. Their home is the Promised Land in Canaan. The people are to return home to their land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### God and his people\n\nIn verse 7, note the mention of a very important biblical theme of God being “your God” and the special relationship that his people have with him.

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
6:1	lu95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	עַתָּ֣ה	1	This refers to future events starting very soon. Alternative translation: “Starting soon” or “Very soon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
6:1	ece6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ & וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה	1	Here, **hand** is a metonym for power. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “by a strong power … and by a strong power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:1	utnn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ & וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה	1	It is not clear in the text whose **hand** is referred to here. The options include: (1) Both refer to God’s hand (forcing Pharaoh’s actions) (2) Both refer to Pharaoh’s hand (forcing the Israelites out) (3) They don’t refer to the same person’s hand; the first refers to God’s and the second to Pharaoh’s. The UST has followed (1), which is the most common interpretation. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: (1) “by my strong hand … and by my strong hand” (2) “by his strong hand … and by his strong hand” (3) “by my strong hand … and by his strong hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

God says the same thing twice, in similar ways, for emphasis. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let my people leave the land” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase intensifies the first by portraying Pharaoh as not merely letting the Israelites go, but as forcing them to leave the land. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let them go, in fact, I will force him to force them to leave his land” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

Before this verse, Yahweh was answering Moses’ question more directly. At the beginning of this verse, Yahweh is reintroduced as “God” because he begins to make a clarifying statement about himself and his relationship with the Israelites and their ancestors as well as his plans for the Israelites. Much of this section repeats what Yahweh has already told Moses. You may want to consider a section break before this verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
6:3	l81y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	בְּ⁠אֵ֣ל שַׁדָּ֑י	1	**El Shaddai** is a title for God that many scholars think means “almighty.” You will need to decide if you will transliterate the term into your language or translate the meaning.

6:3	e36z			וּ⁠שְׁמִ֣⁠י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	This statement is very difficult to understand as God’s name, Yahweh, is used throughout Genesis, including by Abraham and others. There are many theories about what it means; the view followed by the UST is that now God is revealing to the Israelites a fuller meaning of his divine name than what Abraham and others knew. Alternate translation: “but my name Yahweh was not understood by them”
6:4	zxvc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	לָ⁠תֵ֥ת לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1	This is the content of the covenant promise from God to his people. Some languages may need to make this part a direct quotation. To do so, begin a new sentence. Alternate translation: “I said, ‘I will give you the land of Canaan’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
6:4	gkkc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֶ֥רֶץ מְגֻרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־גָּ֥רוּ בָֽ⁠הּ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “the land they lived in as temporary residents” or “the land that was not their home but where they lived as foreigners” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:5	l3yc			נַאֲקַת֙	1	Here, **groaning** means making sad sounds because of pain and suffering.
6:5	aiey			וָ⁠אֶזְכֹּ֖ר אֶת־בְּרִיתִֽ⁠י	1	**I have remembered my covenant** means God is going to take action. Alternative translation: “I will keep my promise”
6:6	rgh0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לָ⁠כֵ֞ן	1	God is now telling Moses to deliver a message to the Israelites of what God is going to do because of everything that he said in verses 2-5. The reason-result relationship is strongly marked here, so translations should make sure to use a connector that marks verse 6-8 as a result of verses 2-5. Alternate translation: “Because of this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:6	yv14			לָ⁠כֵ֞ן אֱמֹ֥ר לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֘ל	1	This is a command from Yahweh to Moses. Alternate translation: “So Yahweh told Moses to say to the Israelites”
6:6	we3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֗ם & אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם & אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙	1	Here every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
6:6	oqnw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠תַּ֨חַת֙ סִבְלֹ֣ת מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	This refers to all the hard work the Egyptians made the Israelites do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the hard work the Egyptians force you to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
6:6	xyn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠זְר֣וֹעַ נְטוּיָ֔ה	1	Here, **arm** is a figurative way of referring to Yahweh’s power, influence, and capacity for action. **Outstretched** means that he is using that power. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “by my great strength” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:6	efx1			וּ⁠בִ⁠שְׁפָטִ֖ים	1	Here, the term **judgments** refers to the plagues that God is about to send to harm Egypt and the Egyptians. Each plague is a response to Pharaoh’s stubbornness. Alternate translation: “and by [greatly] harming the Egyptians”
6:7	o3lb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֥ם & לָ⁠כֶ֖ם & וִֽ⁠ידַעְתֶּ֗ם & אֱלֹ֣הֵי⁠כֶ֔ם & אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Here every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites.

6:7	xsdh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠תַּ֖חַת סִבְל֥וֹת מִצְרָֽיִם	1	This refers to all the hard work the Egyptians forced upon the Israelites. See what you did in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “from the hard work the Egyptians force you to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
6:8	h9ho		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙ & לָ⁠כֶ֛ם	1	Here every occurrence of **you** refers to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
6:8	g9ru		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	נָשָׂ֨אתִי֙ אֶת־יָדִ֔⁠י	1	This is an action that signifies making an oath. Raising the hand may not have the same meaning in your culture, so you may need to use a different symbolic oath-taking action in your translation or simply translate the meaning. Alternate translation: “I promised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
6:8	i3vj			מוֹרָשָׁ֖ה	1	This means the Israelites will own the land. Alternate translation: “as your own land”
6:9	aalj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹ֤א שָֽׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה מִ⁠קֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֲבֹדָ֖ה קָשָֽׁה	1	In some languages it will be necessary to put the reason for the people not listening before the result. Alternate translation: “but because of shortness of spirit and because of hard service, they did not listen to Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:9	eph2			מִ⁠קֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ	1	Here, the people’s **spirit** is spoken of as something that could be measured. By calling it “short,” the author is saying they did not have very much motivation or hope. Alternate translation: “because they had no hope”
6:10	tpw4			לֵּ⁠אמֹֽר	1	This is used to mark the beginning of a direct quotation. It can be omitted if it is unnatural.
6:11	fxf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וִֽ⁠ישַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ	1	This statement tells Moses what to discuss with Pharaoh. Some languages may need to covey this information as a direct quotation. Be careful to change the third-person pronouns to second-person pronouns if you do this. Alternate translation: “and say, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
6:12	h7o0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָ֖ה	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. There may also be a hint of impudence in Moses’ attitude that is conveyed by the words **before the face of Yahweh**. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in the presence of Yahweh” or “boldly to Yahweh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:12	iiui			הֵ֤ן	1	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”
6:12	k7hl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Moses asked this question in hopes that God would change his mind about using Moses. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Since the Israelites did not listen to me, neither will Pharaoh!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:12	lj51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	הֵ֤ן בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֣וּ אֵלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֵיךְ֙ יִשְׁמָעֵ֣⁠נִי פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Moses is presenting a reasoned argument: since this, then probably that. Use a natural way of expressing such arguments in your language. Alternate translation: “Since the sons of Israel have not listened to me, why would you think Pharaoh would listen to me?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:12	k3br		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י עֲרַ֥ל שְׂפָתָֽיִם	1	This is a metaphor that means that Moses was not a good speaker. It is somewhat crude; your translation of this phrase could convey that Moses spoke impolitely. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “And I do not speak well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:13	janr			וַ⁠יְצַוֵּ⁠ם֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְ⁠אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה	1	This phrase is somewhat difficult to translate. Here, **command** could also be translated as “charge” or “commission.” Another difficulty is knowing to whom the command is directed: is it to Moses and Aaron or are they to give the command to Pharaoh and the Israelites; thus **to** could be translated as “for” or “regarding.” Alternate translations: “and he charged them regarding the sons of Israel and regarding Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a command for the sons of Israel and for Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a commission to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh”
6:14	hh3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	Verses 14-27 are background information. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
6:14	h195		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רָאשֵׁ֣י	1	Here, **heads** refers to the original leaders of the clan.

Alternate translation: “Behold, I am not a good speaker. Pharaoh will certainly not listen to me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:30	y4g2			הֵ֤ן	1	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”
6:30	vzhq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם	1	This is a metaphor that means that Moses thought he was not a good speaker.

It is unknown how they were able to do this, but since it was not from Yahweh, they were probably done under some evil power. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])\n\n### Pharaoh’s hard heart\n\nPharaoh’s heart is often described as hard, strong, or heavy in this chapter. This means that he was not willing to obey Yahweh’s instructions.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter Include:\n\n- Moses as God to Pharaoh\n- A number of difficult terms: prophet, signs, wonders, miracles, sorcerers, magicians, magic, judgments, canals, reservoirs\n- The use of “heart” to refer to the seat of will and emotion\n- Up to third-level quotations
7:1	r18p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of [verse 5](../07/05.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
7:1	gy1t			רְאֵ֛ה	1	This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Listen carefully”
7:1	dn1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נְתַתִּ֥י⁠ךָ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לְ⁠פַרְעֹ֑ה	1	This means Moses would represent the same authority to Pharaoh as God did to Moses.

7:3	adsq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַקְשֶׁ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	This means God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **hard**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being strong vs. **hard** here.

If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:8	pwph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה	1	This verse marks the beginning of new sections, both major and minor. The major story of the plagues and Exodus itself unfolds from here until after Pharaoh’s army is defeated at the Red Sea. The next minor event is the miracle of the rods becoming snakes. Either by using particular forms that your language uses to mark transitions or by making a section break and heading, this transition should be marked for readers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
7:8	p2kf			לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST.

The second level may either end after **Pharaoh** or at the end of the verse. If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
7:9	p3xh			לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1	Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST.
7:9	ms5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם & לָ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	These pronouns are plural, referring to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
7:9	ogk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה	1	Although **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses and Aaron are to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so that Pharaoh can see them. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:10	ehm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹ֛ה וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו	1	This time, while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Aaron actually does this right in front of Pharaoh and his servants so they could watch what happens. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternative translation: “where Pharaoh and his servants could see it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:10	kv93			עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו	1	Here, **his servants** does not refer common servants but probably refers to important advisors that would be in the king’s court.
7:11	mqde			לַֽ⁠חֲכָמִ֖ים וְ⁠לַֽ⁠מְכַשְּׁפִ֑ים & חַרְטֻמֵּ֥י	1	Here, **magicians** probably describes both **wise men and sorcerers** rather than being a third group. See translationWords articles for each term.

7:12	prnp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מַטֵּֽה & מַטֹּתָֽ⁠ם	1	It may be necessary in some languages to translate the word **staff** as “snake,” since it had turned into one. This may be true if it would not make sense in the target language to say (because it is not living) that a staff swallowed or ate something. It may also may not make sense in some languages to speak of the snakes as staffs once they have been transformed. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:13	g42f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַק֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note that this is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn, as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:13	wekf			כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1	Because Yahweh’s prediction precedes this event, some languages may need to place the reference to that prediction before the statement that it was fulfilled. See UST.
7:14	d27r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כָּבֵ֖ד לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	Now Yahweh speaks of Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude as if Pharaoh’s **heart** were **heavy**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being strong vs **heavy** here. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh is defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:14	qiyx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1	A new scene begins here, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. Alternatively, you could translate it as an indirect quotation as in the UST. If you do this, take care to adjust the pronoun person (second/third) as appropriate. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:16	cwox			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	Here, **behold** is used to draw attention to the information that follows. In some languages, it will not be translated.
7:17	j1ev			כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	This quotation formula is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
7:17	mywj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	בְּ⁠זֹ֣את	1	This begins a third-level quotation that continues until the end of verse 18. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. It is possible that the third-level quotation actually ends before or after **Behold,** in which case, in the rest of the quote **I** refers to Moses, not Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:17	jjm3			הִנֵּ֨ה	1	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Look at this”
7:18	bsjn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠בָאַ֣שׁ הַ⁠יְאֹ֑ר	1	His warning,**the river will stink**, will happen because the fish die. Alternate translation: “and because of that the river will stink” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:18	nx0q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	לִ⁠שְׁתּ֥וֹת מַ֖יִם	1	This phrase introduces a purpose clause. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternative translation: “in order to find water to drink” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
7:18	rgl0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠נִלְא֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	Here, **themselves** refers back to the subject (**the Egyptians**) to indicated that the Egyptians are the object of the verb as well.

Alternate translation: “And the Egyptians will exhaust the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
7:18	grwh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	מִן־הַ⁠יְאֹֽר	1	After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh’s commands ends. Depending on your decisions about the embedded quotation levels, you may have up to three levels of quotations that need to be closed here. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with closing quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation and quotations within quotations.

You should translate the list in such a way that the locations of the blood are not limited to these specific places, but to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

7:24	m6zn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָל־מִצְרַ֛יִם	1	The word **all** here is a generalization that means “many.” At the least, the upper class would have sent their slaves to dig for them. However, it does indicate that all the Egyptians who wished to drink water had to dig or had to have dug for them.

The narrative will then record who will raise his hand or staff or both. The instruction and the action do not always match exactly. God may say raise your hand, and the narrative may say that Moses raised his staff. These are not conflicting reports. Translators should understand that the hand and the staff are always understood together. They are one unit, and they can both be mentioned, or they can be mentioned separately. In each case, Moses or Aaron raises his hand with the staff in it. This fact is merely expressed differently.

8:9	khfd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	הִתְפָּאֵ֣ר עָלַ⁠י֒	1	Moses speaks with false humility here. He is ironically pointing out Pharaoh’s powerlessness before Yahweh. Alternate translation: “You can choose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
8:9	g0lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	לְ⁠ךָ֗ וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ וּֽ⁠לְ⁠עַמְּ⁠ךָ֔ & מִמְּ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠מִ⁠בָּתֶּ֑י⁠ךָ	1	These lists mean “for everyone” and “from everywhere” (in Egypt). This makes clear that Moses will ask for a complete end of the plague. You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:10	ofw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְמַ֣עַן תֵּדַ֔ע כִּי־אֵ֖ין כַּ⁠יהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	This knowledge is the goal of Yahweh’s granting a respite from the frogs. In some languages you may need to place this at the end of [verse 11](../08/11.md), after Moses says the frogs will leave. Use a natural way in your language for indicating purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
8:10	d1wp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אֱלֹהֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	Here, **our** refers to the Israelites’ God, excluding Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
8:11	zwqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	מִמְּ⁠ךָ֙ וּ⁠מִ⁠בָּ֣תֶּ֔י⁠ךָ וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֲבָדֶ֖י⁠ךָ וּ⁠מֵ⁠עַמֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	This list means “from everywhere and everyone” (in Egypt). This shows that the end of the plague will be as complete as was its extent. You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:12	jjv2			שָׂ֥ם	1	Alternate translation: “Yahweh had set”
8:12	nxyi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֥א מֹשֶׁ֛ה וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֖ן	1	A minor scene shift occurs here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:13	rwe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	מִן־הַ⁠בָּתִּ֥ים מִן־הַ⁠חֲצֵרֹ֖ת וּ⁠מִן־הַ⁠שָּׂדֹֽת	1	This list means “from everywhere” (in Egypt). This makes clear that there was a complete end of the plague. You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:14	a03n			חֳמָרִ֣ם חֳמָרִ֑ם	1	Literally, the Hebrew says “piles piles.” Repetition is used in Hebrew to emphasize how many or how big the piles of frogs were.
8:15	lv2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הַכְבֵּד֙ אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if he made his own **heart heavy**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:14](../07/14.md), but note there that the state of Pharaoh’s heart is reported, whereas here Pharaoh makes his own heart heavy. Alternate translation: “and Pharaoh determined to be defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:15	b47h			כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1	Alternate translation: “just as Yahweh had said Pharaoh would do”
8:16	cikq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָה֮	1	A new scene begins here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. This is the start of the third plague sequence. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:16	s5gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָה֮ אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֒ אֱמֹר֙ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֔ן	1	**Say to Aaron** starts a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. However, it may be helpful to translate one of the parts as an indirect quotation so that you do not have to have two levels of quotations here. See the UST. Alternate translation: “And Yahweh told Moses to tell Aaron” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
8:16	joxz			נְטֵ֣ה אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠הַ֖ךְ	1	This is one action or motion, but it is described with the two verbs that occur throughout this section of plague judgment.
8:16	kpr5			מַטְּ⁠ךָ֔	1	This refers to Aaron’s staff. See note in the [introduction to chapter 8](../08/intro.md) regarding the hand and staff.
8:16	w5el		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לְ⁠כִנִּ֖ם	1	We do not know exactly what this word means. It is probably a tiny (as in dust-particle size), biting insect. You should choose a different insect here than the one in the next plague ([8:21](../08/21.md)-8:31). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:17	l9wj			וַ⁠יֵּט֩ אַהֲרֹ֨ן אֶת־יָד֤⁠וֹ בְ⁠מַטֵּ֨⁠הוּ֙ וַ⁠יַּךְ֙ אֶת־עֲפַ֣ר הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	Again, this is one action or motion, but it is described with the two verbs, **stretched** and **struck**, that occur throughout this section of plague judgment. See how you translated it in the [previous verse](../08/16.md).
8:17	l784			יָד֤⁠וֹ בְ⁠מַטֵּ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	See note in the [introduction to chapter 8](../08/intro.md) regarding the hand and staff.
8:17	nhgt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠כִּנָּ֔ם & כִנִּ֖ים	1	Again, we do not know what this term refers to for certain, so see how you translated it in [8:16](../08/16.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:17	grs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָּ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	Here **man** includes women and children. Alternate translation: “people” or “mankind” or “humans” See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
8:17	grg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־עֲפַ֥ר הָ⁠אָ֛רֶץ & בְּ⁠כָל־אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם	1	This extraordinary statement with the repeated **all** is used to emphasize the extent and severity of the plague. If this would be unnatural in your language use a natural way to communicate that. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
8:18	wga0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠חַרְטֻמִּ֧ים בְּ⁠לָטֵי⁠הֶ֛ם	1	See how you translated these in [7:11](../07/11.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

8:18	mnj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָּ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	Here **man** includes women and children. Alternate translation: “people” or “mankind” or “humans” See UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
8:19	kcs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַֽ⁠חַרְטֻמִּים֙	1	See how you translated this term in [7:11](../07/11.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:19	lk2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֶצְבַּ֥ע אֱלֹהִ֖ים הִ֑וא	1	The words “finger of God” represent the power of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is the powerful work of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
8:19	z1w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַ֤ק לֵב־פַּרְעֹה֙	1	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:19	rp3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	Here, **them** may refer to the magicians or to Aaron and Moses. Alternate translation: “to the magicians’ warning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:19	gjgg			כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה	1	Some languages will need to place this before the thing that Yahweh predicted, as in the UST.
8:20	j5n8			וְ⁠הִתְיַצֵּב֙ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Alternate translation: “and present yourself to Pharaoh”
8:20	frfn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1	A new scene begins here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. This is the beginning of the fourth plague sequence. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:20	syv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:20	vnym			הִנֵּ֖ה	1	**Behold** is used to draw attention to important information that is next. In some languages and translation styles, it will make the most sense to omit this, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully”
8:20	uypa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	This phrase opens a direct quote that continues until the end of [verse 23](../08/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. However, you may also consider making the opening portion an indirect quote so that you do not have a quote inside of a quote for the next verses. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
8:20	eqd2			כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	This quotation formula is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
8:20	a7l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	שַׁלַּ֥ח	1	This phrase opens a second-level direct quotation which continues until the end of [verse 23](../08/23.md), unless you made **thus says Yahweh** an indirect quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
8:20	fgl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֻֽ⁠נִי	1	This is the purpose of the people being let go. Use a natural way in your language for indicating purpose. Alternate translation: “so they can serve me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
8:21	hitq			הִנְ⁠נִי֩	1	The expression **behold me!** is used to draw attention to important information that is next. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully”
8:21	hwcl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הֶ⁠עָרֹ֑ב & הֶ֣⁠עָרֹ֔ב	1	Here, **the swarm** is a collective singular noun that refers to a great number of flying, biting insects traveling in a group. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “swarms of flies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
8:21	l5z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הֶ⁠עָרֹ֑ב & הֶ֣⁠עָרֹ֔ב	1	Here, **the swarm** probably refers to the common large flies that bother humans and livestock. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:21	foli		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	בְּ⁠ךָ֜ וּ⁠בַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֧י⁠ךָ וּֽ⁠בְ⁠עַמְּ⁠ךָ֛ וּ⁠בְ⁠בָתֶּ֖י⁠ךָ & בָּתֵּ֤י מִצְרַ֨יִם֙ & וְ⁠גַ֥ם הָ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה	1	This long list means “everywhere in Egypt.” It is presented in this way for rhetorical effect, that is, to convince Pharaoh of how bad this plague will be so he will obey. You should translate the list in such a way that the flies’ location is not limited to these specific places but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:22	mv8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠בִלְתִּ֥י הֱיֽוֹת־שָׁ֖ם עָרֹ֑ב	1	# General Information:\n\nThis is the goal of Yahweh treating the land of Goshen differently. Alternate translation: “by keeping the swarm from there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
8:22	apum		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	עָרֹ֑ב	1	This is a collective singular noun that refers to a great number of swarming, biting insects. See how you translated this in [8:21](../08/21.md). Alternate translation: “swarms of flies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
8:22	qb9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עָרֹ֑ב	1	These are probably the common large flies that bother humans and livestock. See how you translated this in [8:21](../08/21.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

In some languages you may need to put this phrase the beginning of the verse. Use a natural way in your language for indicating purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
8:22	a28h			אֲנִ֥י יְהוָ֖ה בְּ⁠קֶ֥רֶב הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Here, **am** could be connecting **I** and **Yahweh** or it could be connecting **I, Yahweh** and **in the middle of the land**. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, am in the middle of the land”
8:23	oxr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	פְדֻ֔ת	1	This is a noun derived from a verb meaning “to buy back.” Very broadly, it can mean “to save or rescue.” If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **redemption**, you can express the same idea in another way. See the next note regarding textual variants for more information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:23	tf4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	פְדֻ֔ת	1	Many translations follow the Septuagint here, which uses the word “division.” A minor change to the Hebrew would also produce the word translated “treat differently” in the [previous verse](../08/22.md). Alternate translation: “a division” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
8:23	u4gs			עַמִּ֖⁠י	1	Yahweh’s people, that is, the Israelites. Alternate translation: “the Israelites”
8:23	rg2c			עַמֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	Pharaoh’s people, that is, the Egyptians. Alternate translation: “the Egyptians”
8:23	tb24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	לְ⁠מָחָ֥ר יִהְיֶ֖ה הָ⁠אֹ֥ת הַ⁠זֶּֽה׃	1	After this phrase, the three levels of direct quotations of Yahweh that started in [8:20](../08/20.md) ends. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with closing first-level, second-level, and third-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of quotations. You may not have three levels if you made any level an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
8:24	gw3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֤עַשׂ יְהוָה֙ כֵּ֔ן	1	The UST supplies a brief sentence filling in the gap between Yahweh’s command to Moses and the onset of the plague. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly to make the progression of events clear. Alternate translation: “Moses obeyed the instructions Yahweh gave him, and Pharaoh responded as Yahweh had said he would. And Yahweh did so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:24	lk5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יַּ֤עַשׂ יְהוָה֙ כֵּ֔ן	1	There is a minor scene change here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:24	ut0f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עָרֹ֣ב	1	There are probably the common large flies that bother humans and livestock. See how you translated this in [8:21](../08/21.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:24	dg0k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֹא֙	1	Some languages may need to translate this as “going” rather than “coming.” Alternate translation: “and … went” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
8:24	tmcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	בֵּ֥יתָ⁠ה פַרְעֹ֖ה וּ⁠בֵ֣ית עֲבָדָ֑י⁠ו	1	This means “to everyone everywhere” (in Egypt), as made explicit in the next statement. This makes clear that the insects were throughout the land. You should translate this in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:24	nd6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י הֶ⁠עָרֹֽב	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The swarms of flies devastated the land” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:24	ngue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י הֶ⁠עָרֹֽב	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of the insects. Alternate translation: “because the insects were everywhere” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

8:25	gj2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	לֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Here, **your** is plural. It could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) if your team decides it means Moses and Aaron; otherwise use a plural form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
8:26	e9wk			תּוֹעֲבַ֣ת מִצְרַ֔יִם & תּוֹעֲבַ֥ת מִצְרַ֛יִם	1	We do not know what about their sacrificing was an **abomination** to the Egyptians. The same term is used in Genesis 43:32 and 46:34 to describe the Egyptians’ feelings about eating with Hebrews and about the Hebrew profession of shepherding, respectively. Translators should attempt to convey the strong negative feelings that would be provoked in the Egyptians without speculating as to the cause.
8:26	idkt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נִזְבַּ֖ח & אֱלֹהֵ֑י⁠נוּ & נִזְבַּ֞ח & יִסְקְלֻֽ⁠נוּ	1	Here, **we**, **our,** and **us** should all be translated as exclusive (if your language makes that distinction).

8:26	i7dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִסְקְלֻֽ⁠נוּ	1	Moses asks this question to show Pharaoh that the Egyptians would not allow the Israelites to worship Yahweh by making a sacrifice repugnant to them. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “they will certainly stone us!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:26	gy7d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	The express **before their eyes** is a figurative way of saying “where they can see.” If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in their sight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:27	ju3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נֵלֵ֖ךְ & וְ⁠זָבַ֨חְנוּ֙ & אֱלֹהֵ֔י⁠נוּ & אֵלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	Here, **we**, **our,** and **us** should all be translated as exclusive (if your language makes that distinction). Pharaoh and his people are not included. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
8:28	qxes		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙ & אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶם֙ & תַרְחִ֖יקוּ	1	If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
8:28	mla2			אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙	1	Alternate translation: “the Israelites”
8:28	hnud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הַרְחֵ֥ק & תַרְחִ֖יקוּ	1	In Hebrew, **far** is repeated to emphasize (with **not**) that they are absolutely not to go too far. If your language does not use repeating words like this, express the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:29	h94t			הִנֵּ֨ה	1	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation. Alternate translation: “Know this”
8:29	jirm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הֶ⁠עָרֹ֗ב	1	These are probably the common large flies that bother humans and livestock. See how you translated this in [8:21](../08/21.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:29	yvcl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מִ⁠פַּרְעֹ֛ה & פַּרְעֹה֙	1	Moses may be using the third person to refer to Pharaoh to show respect, because the king appears to be relenting. If use of the third person is not a way of showing respect in your culture or is not a valid way of addressing an individual at all, you may need to change the form. Alternate translation: “from you … you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
8:29	la3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	מִ⁠פַּרְעֹ֛ה מֵ⁠עֲבָדָ֥י⁠ו וּ⁠מֵ⁠עַמּ֖⁠וֹ	1	This list means “from everywhere and everyone” (in Egypt). This shows that the end of the plague will be as complete as its extent. You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:29	bf85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אַל־יֹסֵ֤ף פַּרְעֹה֙ הָתֵ֔ל לְ⁠בִלְתִּי֙ שַׁלַּ֣ח אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “you must begin to deal truthfully with us and let our people go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
8:29	hh4q			רַ֗ק אַל־יֹסֵ֤ף פַּרְעֹה֙ הָתֵ֔ל	1	Alternate translation: “But you must not deceive us” or “But you must not lie to us”
8:30	tull		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֥א מֹשֶׁ֖ה	1	There is a minor scene shift here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:31	rj50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הֶ⁠עָרֹ֔ב	1	These are probably the common large flies that bother humans and livestock. See how you translated this in [8:21](../08/21.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

This makes clear that there was a complete end of the plague. You should translate the list in such a way that it does not convey limitation to these specifics but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:31	mb4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לֹ֥א נִשְׁאַ֖ר אֶחָֽד	1	This extreme statement emphasizes how thoroughly Yahweh removed the insects from the land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that emphasizes thoroughness or complete lack of the swarm. Alternate translation: “There was not a single one of these insects left in the whole land” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
8:32	sb5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּכְבֵּ֤ד פַּרְעֹה֙ אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if he made his own **heart heavy**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [8:15](../08/15.md). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh determined to be defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

9:1	se3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוָה֙	1	# General Information:\n\nA new scene begins here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. This is the beginning of the fifth plague sequence. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
9:1	p1oj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues to the end of [9:4](../09/04.md) and contains two additional levels of quotes. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
9:1	fo4o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠דִבַּרְתָּ֣ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֔ים	1	You may want to translate the second-level quotation beginning with **Thus says Yahweh** as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “and say to him that Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
9:1	w0lg			כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1	This quotation formula is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
9:1	x4bd			עַמִּ֖⁠י	1	Alternate translation: “the Israelites”
9:2	l7ld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כִּ֛י אִם־מָאֵ֥ן אַתָּ֖ה לְ⁠שַׁלֵּ֑חַ וְ⁠עוֹדְ⁠ךָ֖ מַחֲזִ֥יק בָּֽ⁠ם	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “If you continue refusing to let them go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
9:3	fltr			הִנֵּ֨ה	1	The word **behold** is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternate translation: “look out”
9:3	ume2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַד־יְהוָ֜ה הוֹיָ֗ה בְּ⁠מִקְנְ⁠ךָ֙	1	Here, **hand** represents Yahweh’s power to afflict their animals with disease. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “Then the power of Yahweh will afflict your livestock” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:3	cjt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יַד־יְהוָ֜ה	1	This is part of the reported speech that Yahweh wants Moses to say to Pharaoh. Therefore, you could change the third person **the hand of Yahweh** to first person if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “My hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
9:3	tn3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	בְּ⁠מִקְנְ⁠ךָ֙	1	While the word **your** here is not plural, the next verse shows that it refers to all the people of Egypt who owned cattle. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, you may want to use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
9:3	v8ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	בַּ⁠סּוּסִ֤ים בַּֽ⁠חֲמֹרִים֙ בַּ⁠גְּמַלִּ֔ים בַּ⁠בָּקָ֖ר וּ⁠בַ⁠צֹּ֑אן	1	This long list is meant to reinforce the universal effects of the coming plague. It is presented in this way for rhetorical effect, that is, to convince Pharaoh of how bad this plague will be so he will obey. You should translate the list in such a way that it is not limiting but is understood to imply universality. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
9:3	m1fk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בַּ⁠בָּקָ֖ר & וּ⁠בַ⁠צֹּ֑אן	1	These (**cattle** and **flock**) are collective singular nouns which refer to groups of animals. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “on your bulls and cows and on your sheep and goats” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
9:3	f5sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כָּבֵ֥ד	1	Here the plague is spoken of as if it weighed a lot. This means it would be very bad. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “severe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:4	x12r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יְהוָ֔ה	1	This is part of the reported speech that Yahweh wants Moses to say to Pharaoh. Therefore, you could change the third person **Yahweh** to first person if it would be clearer in your language. You should do the same as you did in the [previous verse](../09/04.md). Alternate translation: “I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
9:4	lp3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Here, **Israel** refers to the Israelites. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the Israelite people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:4	u60c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Here, **Israel** is used as a collective singular noun. If your language would not refer to a group of people in this way, you may need to translate it as plural. Alternate translation: “the Israelite people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
9:4	fs25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִקְנֵ֣ה מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	Here, **Egypt** refers to the Egyptians.

9:5	vqz2			וַ⁠יָּ֥שֶׂם יְהוָ֖ה מוֹעֵ֣ד	1	Alternate translation: “And Yahweh made an appointed time”
9:5	w8gk			לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	This marks the beginning of a direct quotation. It can be omitted in translation if your language does not use a similar form. However, in this sentence it is the only verb related to speech, so you may need to translate it similarly to the way the UST does.
9:5	pxb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יְהוָ֛ה	1	Yahweh is speaking here. Therefore, you could change the third person **Yahweh** to first person if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
9:6	gt3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַשׂ יְהוָ֜ה	1	It is implied that Moses went and spoke to Pharaoh as directed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Moses did as Yahweh had commanded. And Yahweh did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:6	cx5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כֹּ֖ל מִקְנֵ֣ה	1	This is exaggerated to emphasize the seriousness of the event. There were still some animals alive that were afflicted by later plagues. However, it may be best to translate this with the word “all.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
9:6	gy7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	Here, **Egypt** refers to the Egyptians. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the Egyptian peoples’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:6	i0bl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	וּ⁠מִ⁠מִּקְנֵ֥ה בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לֹא־מֵ֥ת אֶחָֽד	1	Here the author uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “But every single one of the Israelites’ livestock lived” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
9:7	md84			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֗ה	1	Again, **behold** is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternate translation: “and listen”

If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “every single one of the Israelites’ livestock was alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
9:7	kkuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	Here, **Israel** refers to the Israelites. Alternate translation: “of the Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:7	sfor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	Here, **Israel** is a collective singular noun. If your language would not refer to a group of people in this way, you may need to translate it as plural. Alternate translation: “the Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
9:7	j51j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּכְבַּד֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **heavy**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:14](../07/14.md). Alternate translation: “But Pharaoh was defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:8	brm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָה֮	1	A new scene begins here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. This is the start of the sixth plague scene. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
9:8	luhg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	לָ⁠כֶם֙ & חָפְנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	**You** and **your** refer to both Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use dual form (if you have one) or plural forms (if not) here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
9:8	ydar			קְח֤וּ לָ⁠כֶם֙ מְלֹ֣א חָפְנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: “Each of you fill both your hands with”
9:8	u5wn			פִּ֖יחַ כִּבְשָׁ֑ן	1	Alternate translation: “ash from a furnace” or “ash produced by a furnace”
9:8	gk7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	פִּ֖יחַ	1	Here, **ash** is singular. For some languages you may need to make it plural as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
9:8	gu1v			הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יְמָ⁠ה	1	Alternate translation: “toward the sky”
9:8	p795		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י פַרְעֹֽה	1	The phrase **before the eyes of Pharaoh** means in his sight.

9:11	k9uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠שְּׁחִ֑ין	1	Here, **the face of** means the presence of or perhaps pain from the boils. Alternate translation: “because of the boils” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:11	lpmq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠שְּׁחִ֑ין & הַ⁠שְּׁחִ֔ין	1	To have **boils** means to have a condition where the skin is red, hot, and painful, the skin breaks open, and puss and blood come out. See how you translated this in [9:9](../09/09.md). However, this time only **boils** is used, without the description (“bursting blisters”) that is in the previous two verses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
9:12	p5m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְחַזֵּ֤ק יְהוָה֙ אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	This phrase means that it was God who made him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](../04/21.md). Alternate translation: “But Yahweh caused Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:13	ifs8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יְהוָה֙ אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	A new scene begins here. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. This is the beginning of the seventh plague sequence. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. However, it may be useful to translate this short quote frame as an indirect quotation, as the UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
9:13	hsl6			כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1	This quotation formula is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
9:14	z68b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֣י	1	Here it is implied that Pharaoh will again not let God’s people go. **For** is expressing the result, that is, God’s response to Pharaoh’s disobedience to the command immediately preceding. You may need to insert this as in the UST or choose a contrastive conjunction. Alternate translation: “Otherwise,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
9:14	n6wq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲנִ֨י שֹׁלֵ֜חַ אֶת־כָּל־מַגֵּפֹתַ⁠י֙ אֶֽל־לִבְּ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, **to your heart** is a synecdoche that means that even Pharaoh will be hurt by the plagues. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am about to send all my plagues against you personally” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
9:15	f056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	כִּ֤י עַתָּה֙ שָׁלַ֣חְתִּי אֶת־יָדִ֔⁠י וָ⁠אַ֥ךְ אוֹתְ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠אֶֽת־עַמְּ⁠ךָ֖ בַּ⁠דָּ֑בֶר וַ⁠תִּכָּחֵ֖ד מִן־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	This verse presents two things that God could have done but did not do to the Egyptians. This is to set up the reason he gives in the [next verse](../09/16.md). Be sure that it is clear in your translation that these are hypothetical past events. See the note regarding Yahweh’s stated goals in the next verse. Some languages may need to reverse the order of these verses to put Yahweh’s goals before his non-action. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
9:15	a3l8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שָׁלַ֣חְתִּי אֶת־יָדִ֔⁠י וָ⁠אַ֥ךְ אוֹתְ⁠ךָ֛	1	Here, **my hand** refers to God’s power. Alternate translation: “I could have used my power to attack you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “and caused you and your people to suffer from a plague” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:16	kwks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	וְ⁠אוּלָ֗ם בַּ⁠עֲב֥וּר זֹאת֙ הֶעֱמַדְתִּ֔י⁠ךָ בַּ⁠עֲב֖וּר הַרְאֹתְ⁠ךָ֣ אֶת־כֹּחִ֑⁠י וּ⁠לְמַ֛עַן סַפֵּ֥ר שְׁמִ֖⁠י בְּ⁠כָל־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ׃	1	The statements from **to show** to the end of the verse are Yahweh’s stated goals, and thus, his reasons for not yet destroying Egypt and Pharaoh. You will need to translate, **However, for this reason I appointed you: in order** in a way that connects with the [previous verse](../09/15.md) in an action-goal manner. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
9:16	nec7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠לְמַ֛עַן סַפֵּ֥ר שְׁמִ֖⁠י בְּ⁠כָל־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Here, **my name** represents Yahweh’s reputation. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “and so that people everywhere will know who I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:17	h3ed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עוֹדְ⁠ךָ֖ מִסְתּוֹלֵ֣ל בְּ⁠עַמִּ֑⁠י	1	Pharaoh’s opposition to letting the Israelites go to worship Yahweh is spoken of as if he were raising himself up as a barrier to them. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “You are still blocking my people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:17	sdav		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	מִסְתּוֹלֵ֣ל	1	Here, Pharaoh is both the subject and object of the sentence. Translate this in a way that conveys that (1) Pharaoh is making Pharaoh (himself) proud and (2) this is metaphorically expressed as Pharaoh making Pharaoh (himself) the obstacle in the Israelites’ way to freedom (as discussed in the previous note.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
9:17	r1wv			מִסְתּוֹלֵ֣ל	1	Here, **you** is Pharaoh.
9:17	zfhb			בְּ⁠עַמִּ֑⁠י	1	Here, **my people** are the Israelites.

However, the next two verses make it clear that Pharaoh’s servants heard and understood this warning to be for them as well. In this sense Pharaoh represents the Egyptians. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:19	eo52			וְ⁠יָרַ֧ד עֲלֵ⁠הֶ֛ם הַ⁠בָּרָ֖ד	1	Alternate translation: “and the balls of ice will drop on”
9:19	x4ja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כָּל־הָ⁠אָדָ֨ם	1	Here, **man** means humans and includes men, women, and children. Alternate translation: “everyone” or “anyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
9:19	itlv			וְ⁠הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֜ה	1	Here, **and beast** includes domestic and wild animals.
9:19	f80e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וָ⁠מֵֽתוּ	1	The people and animals **will die** because they will be fatally injured by the hail. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the hail will kill them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

9:20	p3nz			הַ⁠יָּרֵא֙ אֶת־דְּבַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה מֵֽ⁠עַבְדֵ֖י פַּרְעֹ֑ה	1	Here, **the word of Yahweh** refers to Yahweh’s warning, more broadly it means they believed that Yahweh would do what he threatened. Alternate translation: “Those of Pharaoh’s servants who feared Yahweh’s warning”
9:21	dvwv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־שָׂ֛ם לִבּ֖⁠וֹ אֶל	1	Here, **set his heart** means he believed or thought something was true.

Alternate translation: “but whoever did not respect” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:21	bzqy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דְּבַ֣ר יְהוָ֑ה	1	Here, **the word of Yahweh** refers to Yahweh’s warning, more broadly it means they did not believe that Yahweh would do what he threatened. Alternate translation: “Yahweh’s warning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

9:27	sh1x			חָטָ֣אתִי	1	Some commentators suggest translating **sinned** more literally, that is “missed the mark,” because Pharaoh is probably not admitting a moral failure, but instead, admitting that he misjudged.
9:27	joxy			הַ⁠צַּדִּ֔יק & הָ⁠רְשָׁעִֽים	1	Many commentators suggest that Pharaoh is using these terms in a narrow, legal sense and only referring to this instance. That is, he is saying something like “I’ve lost this round in court.” See UST.
9:27	wag1			וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י	1	Here, **my people** refers to the Egyptians.
9:28	r0cs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	וְ⁠לֹ֥א תֹסִפ֖וּ⁠ן לַ⁠עֲמֹֽד	1	Here Pharaoh uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “really, I will let you go”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
9:29	ajz3			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָי⁠ו֙ מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	Alternate translation: “And Moses said to Pharaoh”

9:30	tn94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה וַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	This phrase is shifted to the beginning of the sentence to mark focus on Pharaoh and his servants because, despite Yahweh demonstrating his power, they are not yet afraid of him. If your language has a form or discourse feature that draws contrastive focus to participants, use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
9:30	srx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י יְהוָ֥ה	1	Here, **face** means presence or power. Alternate translation: “of Yahweh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:31	pcwg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	0		This and the next verse give background information so that the destruction caused by the later plagues can be understood by the reader.

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 9:29](../09/29.md). Alternate translation: “lifted up his hands toward Yahweh and prayed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
9:34	ke5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּכְבֵּ֥ד לִבּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if he made his own **heart heavy**. This time his servants do the same. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [8:15](../08/15.md). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh determined to be defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:34	nz0e			וַ⁠יֹּ֣סֶף לַ⁠חֲטֹ֑א	1	This statement is from the author’s perspective. Therefore, unlike in [9:27](../09/27.md), **sin** should be translated with the word your language uses for “sin.”
9:34	ooed			וַ⁠יַּכְבֵּ֥ד לִבּ֖⁠וֹ ה֥וּא וַ⁠עֲבָדָֽי⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: “and he caused his heart to be heavy. His servants did also” or “and he caused his heart to be heavy. His servants did the same”
9:35	yxt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יֶּחֱזַק֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**. If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:35	x0kn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָ֖ה בְּ⁠יַד־מֹשֶֽׁה	1	This is similar to [9:12](../09/12.md). In this case, what Yahweh said is figuratively spoken of as if it were something that could be held in someone’s hand. This means that Moses delivered a message from Yahweh that Pharaoh would be stubborn. It is not clear if this message was given to the Israelites or if this refers to Moses’ statement to Pharaoh in [9:30](../09/30.md). If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “just as Yahweh had told Moses to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:intro	s5g1				0	# Exodus 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe text does not specify, but some time seems to have passed between chapters nine and ten (see 9:31-32 and 10:5).\n- v. 1-20: Eighth plague: locusts\n - v. 16-20: Pharaoh seems to repent, but it does not last\n- v. 21-29: Ninth plague: darkness

Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their **hearts** were **heavy.** If the **heart** is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](../04/21.md), but note that the metaphor is slightly different here. Alternate translation: “for I have caused Pharaoh and his servants to be stubborn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:2	zg4c			הִתְעַלַּ֨לְתִּי֙ בְּ⁠מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	Alternate translation: “I mocked Egypt”
10:3	pm8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו	1	After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues until near the end of [10:6](../10/06.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
10:3	u3mq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֔ים	1	It may be helpful to turn the introductory quotation into an indirect quotation so that you do not have to use quotes within quotes. Alternate translation: “and told him that Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, said thus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
10:3	vze4			כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙	1	This quotation formula is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.
10:3	cicf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַד־מָתַ֣י מֵאַ֔נְתָּ לֵ⁠עָנֹ֖ת מִ⁠פָּנָ֑⁠י	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of Yahweh. Particularly, it means the presence of his judgment (the plagues). Alternate translation: “Until when will you refuse to be humble when I judge you” or “Until when will you refuse to be humble before me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:4	ge67			הִנְ⁠נִ֨י	1	Here, **behold me** adds emphasis to what is said next. Alternate translation: “beware”
10:4	uwtp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אַרְבֶּ֖ה	1	Here, **locust** is a singular noun referring to the group as one. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “locusts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
10:5	zu5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וְ⁠לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠רְאֹ֣ת אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	These parallel statements have a similar meaning. They are used to emphasize the great number of locusts that are coming. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
10:5	rdav			וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	Alternate translation: “And it will cover the land from sight”
10:5	oj3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ & וְ⁠אָכַ֣ל & וְ⁠אָכַל֙	1	Here the pronoun **it** agrees in number with the collective singular “locust” in the previous verse. Insects are often referred to without gender in English, but you will need to use whatever number, gender, or noun class is required in your language to agree with the word for “locust” that you used in the [previous verse](../10/04.md). See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

Either way, the entire phrase is meant to emphasize an extremely long time, with the intended meaning being “never.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
10:6	ma0o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּ֥פֶן	1	[Verse 3](../10/03.md) says that Aaron came in to see the king with Moses. It is implied that he left with him as well. You may make this explicit if it would help your readers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:7	xn8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַד־מָתַי֙ יִהְיֶ֨ה זֶ֥ה לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ לְ⁠מוֹקֵ֔שׁ	1	Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to show Pharaoh that he is stubbornly causing the destruction of Egypt. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We must not let this man continue to cause trouble for us!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
10:7	jqbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	Here, **men** may be literal or it may refer to the Israelites, including the women and children. In [verse 10](../10/10.md) the king rejects the idea of letting the women and children go, and in [verse 11](../10/11.md) he specifically says that the men can go. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
10:7	xdm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠טֶ֣רֶם תֵּדַ֔ע כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם	1	Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to bring Pharaoh to recognize what he refuses to see. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should realize that Egypt is destroyed!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
10:7	c6pr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that these plagues have destroyed Egypt” or “that their God has destroyed Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:8	bu1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יּוּשַׁ֞ב אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֤ה וְ⁠אֶֽת־אַהֲרֹן֙ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And a servant brought Moses and Aaron back to Pharaoh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:8	fzsv			מִ֥י וָ⁠מִ֖י	1	Alternate translation: “Who all”
10:9	fnnl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נֵלֵ֑ךְ & נֵלֵ֔ךְ	1	**We** means the Israelites and does not include Pharaoh or the Egyptians. Use an exclusive form here if your language has this distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
10:10	hjc9			יְהִ֨י כֵ֤ן יְהוָה֙ עִמָּ⁠כֶ֔ם כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר אֲשַׁלַּ֥ח אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠אֶֽת־טַפְּ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	**May Yahweh be with you** is usually a blessing but is almost certainly not a blessing here. It likely means something like “It will take Yahweh’s power to make me let you and your children go,” or “May Yahweh be as favorable to you as I am to the idea of letting your children go.” Pharaoh is saying that it will take Yahweh to make him do what Moses wants, but he does not think that will happen. Alternate translation: “It will be clear that Yahweh is with you if I let you and your children go”
10:10	w8x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רְא֕וּ כִּ֥י רָעָ֖ה נֶ֥גֶד פְּנֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	The phrase **for evil is before your faces** could either be a warning from Pharaoh that Moses’ actions will lead to evil for the Israelites, or it could mean that Pharaoh thinks the Israelites plan something that he considers evil. **Faces** is a metonym for the whole person. Alternate translations: “I see that you plan evil” or “Be careful! Your actions will have bad consequences” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:11	pkm4			הַ⁠גְּבָרִים֙	1	This interjection clarifies who may go. Alternate translation: “the leaders”

10:16	ty9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶֽם	1	Here, **you** and **your** are plural. These could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to all the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
10:17	tsve			שָׂ֣א	1	Alternate translation: “take away”
10:17	ttog			אַ֣ךְ הַ⁠פַּ֔עַם & רַ֖ק	1	Pharaoh could either be desperate and using **just this once … only** to attempt to make his request as small as possible to increase the chances of it being granted, or he could be still too proud to admit guilt beyond this single incident (which is probably his bold statement about Yahweh being with the Israelites in [10:10](../10/10.md)). The former seems more likely given that he terms this plague “this death.” If your culture has a way of making a request seem as small as possible, you may want to use it to translate Pharaoh’s request.
10:17	kd6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Here, **your** is plural. This could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to all the Israelites.

10:21	m38s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִצְרָ֑יִם וְ⁠יָמֵ֖שׁ חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	This is a somewhat puzzling construction which describes the darkness. Most English translations take it as a passive, which restated actively means, “people will feel the darkness,” meaning metaphorically what is expressed in different ways in the UST and the alternate translation here. Another option is to view the Hebrew verb form as causative and translate as such: “and the darkness will cause people to feel,” meaning people will have to feel where they are going because they will not be able to see. A final option would be a personification of darkness such that the darkness gropes around, filling in every place in the land. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Egypt, an extremely oppressive darkness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

11:intro	pu3u				0	# Exodus 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\r\n\nChapter 11 is a transition point in the book. The previous nine plagues (in their three sequences of three) have come to an end and the last plague, the death of the firstborn, is about to occur, along with the Passover and the Exodus itself. It is difficult to know if the events in chapter 11 all are recorded in the order in which they happened. For translation, you should follow the order of the text if it will not confuse your readers.\n\nIt may be helpful to think that after the end of chapter 10, Yahweh spoke to Moses immediately, before he actually left Pharaoh’s presence (v. [1](../11/01.md)-[2](../11/02.md)). [Verse 3](../11/03.md) is a comment suggesting that the Egyptians will be willing to do as the Israelites are told to ask them to do in [v. 2](../11/02.md). In verses [4](../11/04.md)-[7](../11/07.md) Moses gives Pharaoh and his officials a message from Yahweh that Yahweh is giving to Moses right at that moment. At the end of [v. 8](../11/08.md) Moses leaves Pharaoh’s presence (completing the interaction from the [end of ch. 10](../10/28.md)). [Verse 9](../11/09.md) may either be Yahweh telling Moses what is going to happen, or it could be part of the summary that occurs in [v. 10](../11/10.md). Verse 10 summarizes what has happened in chs. 5-10 (especially the plagues in chs. 7-10) in preparation for the great last plague.
11:1	hrom		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה	1	After this phrase, a direct quote begins that continues until the end of [11:2](../11/02.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. There may be other quotations in this chapter; they will be marked by the same punctuation, but they will not have their own notes unless there is something unique about them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
11:1	eqeb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	כְּ⁠שַׁ֨לְּח֔⁠וֹ & יְגָרֵ֥שׁ	1	These verbs (**lets go** and **drive away**) are meant to immediately follow one another. When you translate, make sure they are almost simultaneous in time; the letting go happens and then immediately the driving away happens. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
11:1	iocd			כָּלָ֕ה גָּרֵ֛שׁ יְגָרֵ֥שׁ	1	The wording here is very forceful. Use strong words, forms, or phrasing when you are translating.
11:1	i87h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם & אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Each occurrence of the word **you** in this verse is plural and refers to Moses and the rest of the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
11:2	t14c			נָ֖א	1	Here, **now** conveys urgency, indicating that Moses should speak soon, without delaying for other things. If you have a way of giving a command that shows that it is important for someone to do it quickly, it would be better to translate in that way than in a way that means “now” in a time sense (versus earlier or later).
11:2	nlsk			בְּ⁠אָזְנֵ֣י הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1	Alternate translation: “so the people hear you” or “when all the people are listening”
11:2	jl6w			כְּלֵי־כֶ֖סֶף וּ⁠כְלֵ֥י זָהָֽב	1	These could be any sort of thing made from silver or gold (for instance: utensils, cups, pitchers, plates, candleholders), not just jewelry.

11:3	hng9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	חֵ֥ן הָ⁠עָ֖ם בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם	1	Here, **in the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings or opinion. **Favor** means those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them. (Because the Egyptians have suffered under God’s judgment, the Egyptians want so badly to see them leave). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. See how you translated this in [3:21](../03/21.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

First, two extremes are mentioned: the highest of society (**Pharaoh, who sits on his throne**) and the lowest (**the slave girl who is behind the mill**). Then the animals (**beasts**) are added making it a three-item list of parts of society and even the economy to show the totality of the coming judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
11:5	hr1x			אֲשֶׁ֖ר אַחַ֣ר הָ⁠רֵחָ֑יִם	1	Alternate translation: “who is grinding at the handmill” or “who is behind the handmill grinding grain”

11:7	b60a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹ֤א יֶֽחֱרַץ & לְשֹׁנ֔⁠וֹ	1	This means to make an unfriendly noise. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “will not growl” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
11:7	t61i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	תֵּֽדְע֔וּ⁠ן	1	Here, **you** is plural. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

11:8	hoft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠הִשְׁתַּֽחֲוּוּ־לִ֣⁠י	1	This does not mean to bow for worshiping. **They will bow to** Moses to beg him to leave. They will do this to show how desperate they will be for Moses and the Israelites to go. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
11:8	l678		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הִשְׁתַּֽחֲוּוּ־לִ֣⁠י	1	**They will bow to** Moses to beg him to leave. They will do this to show how desperate they will be for Moses and the Israelites to go. If this action would not mean the same thing in your culture, you may need to make the reason they are bowing explicit. Alternate translation: “and they will bow down to me to beg” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:8	njx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָ֣ם אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠רַגְלֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Here, the people are figuratively pictured as below Moses, which means they are his followers. The reference to **feet** also can mean they go the same place he goes, again, meaning “follower.” If your language uses a similar image to mean follower, you can translate the image; if not, you may use another image from your culture or translate the meaning. Alternate translation: “and all the people who are following you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:8	ria5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי־כֵ֖ן אֵצֵ֑א	1	This means that Moses and the Israelites will leave Egypt.

11:8	milu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בָּ⁠חֳרִי־אָֽף	1	This is an idiom meaning that Moses is angry. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “enraged” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

11:10	um4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְחַזֵּ֤ק יְהוָה֙ אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	This means God made him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his **heart** were **strong**.

12:intro	fd2f				0	# Exodus 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe events of this chapter are known as the Passover. They are remembered in the celebration of Passover. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])\n1. Instruction v. 1-28\n   * v. 1-20: Yahweh gives instructions\n      * v. 1-11: how to eat this Passover\n      * v. 12-13: description of the plague\n      * v. 14-20: directions for future celebration of Passover\n    * v. 21-28: Moses repeats Yahweh’s instructions to Israelites\n2. Narrative v. 29-42: Passover and Exodus\n3. Instruction v. 43-49: which foreigners may eat Passover\n4. Summary Narrative v. 50-51\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Unleavened bread\n\nThe concept of unleavened bread is introduced in this chapter. Its significance stems from its connection to the events in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/unleavenedbread]])\n\n### Ethnic segregation\n\nThe Hebrew people were to be separate from the rest of the world. Because of this, they separated themselves from other people groups. At this time, these foreigners were looked upon as unholy. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n## Potential Translation Issues:\n\n### Passover\n\n### Pronoun usage\n\nIn the long quotation (verses 3-20) that Yahweh tells Moses and Aaron to convey to the Israelites, he speaks of them in the third person (“they must”) in [verses 3](../12/03.md)–4 and [verses 7](../12/07.md)–8 and to them in the second person (“you must”) for all the rest of the instruction. Some languages may need to keep the pronoun person consistent throughout the quotation.\n\n### You plural\n\nIn this chapter, almost every occurrence of “you” or “your” is plural. Each one refers to all the Israelites. Those that are not will be marked. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form throughout unless otherwise noted. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

It marks when Yahweh rescued the Israelites from the Egyptians. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
12:3	lv6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	דַּבְּר֗וּ	1	The command here is to both Moses and Aaron. If your language uses a different form if two are people addressed, use a dual form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

Alternate translation: “the father of each household must take a lamb for his household, one per household”
12:3	d1f5			שֶׂ֥ה לַ⁠בָּֽיִת	1	Alternate translation: “one lamb per house”
12:3	qzct			שֶׂ֥ה & שֶׂ֥ה	1	The word **lamb** literally means “of the flock,” and it could also be translated as a sheep or a goat. Here, the ULT uses **lamb** (a young sheep), because [verse 5](../12/05.md) specifies that it must be one year old. “Kid” (a young goat) would be equally valid as verse 5 also says that it could be either a sheep or a goat. You may translate it as either sheep or goat, whichever would be most familiar.
12:4	xzn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אִם־יִמְעַ֣ט הַ⁠בַּיִת֮ מִ⁠הְיֹ֣ת מִ⁠שֶּׂה֒	1	This means that there are not enough people in the family to eat an entire lamb. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If there are not enough people in the household to eat an entire lamb” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:4	o258			וּ⁠שְׁכֵנ֛⁠וֹ הַ⁠קָּרֹ֥ב אֶל־בֵּית֖⁠וֹ בְּ⁠מִכְסַ֣ת נְפָשֹׁ֑ת	1	The phrase **by the number of people** helps to clarify which sort of **neighbor near to his house** the Israelite should choose. They should count their own household and another household and try to have a group that is the right number to eat an entire lamb. Alternate translation: “and his neighbor who lives near him and whose family is the right size to share a lamb with”
12:4	fu2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אִ֚ישׁ	1	Here **man** refers to each person, whether man, woman, or child. Alternate translation: “each family member” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

12:8	uxn6			מְרֹרִ֖ים	1	These are edible but strong-tasting leaves, seeds, and other parts of plants.
12:9	ny3a			אַל־תֹּאכְל֤וּ מִמֶּ֨⁠נּוּ֙ נָ֔א	1	Alternate translation: “Do not eat the lamb or goat uncooked”
12:11	ks7d			חֲגֻרִ֔ים	1	Here, **belts** are strips of leather or fabric for tying around the waist.
12:11	nzw2			וַ⁠אֲכַלְתֶּ֤ם אֹת⁠וֹ֙ בְּ⁠חִפָּז֔וֹן	1	Alternate translation: “And you must eat it quickly”
12:11	r789		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פֶּ֥סַח ה֖וּא לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1	**It** refers to eating the animal on the tenth day of the month. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “This observance is Yahweh’s Passover” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:12	sa5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־אֱלֹהֵ֥י מִצְרַ֛יִם אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה שְׁפָטִ֖ים	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you can express the same idea in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:13	tywz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠מַשְׁחִ֔ית	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **destruction**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to destroy you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
12:13	bnoe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִֽהְיֶ֨ה בָ⁠כֶ֥ם נֶ֨גֶף֙	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and I will not put the plague on you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:13	ox3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם	1	Yahweh is going to strike the people and animals who live in **the land of Egypt**. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “on everything living in the land of Egypt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
12:14	fa9q			וְ⁠הָיָה֩ הַ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֤ה	1	Verses 14-[20](../12/20.md) are instructions for the Israelites’ future celebration of the Passover. If your language makes a distinction between near and far future events or between near and general commands, you may need to make clear that these verses primarily have a later application.
12:14	usns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	הַ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֤ה	1	Here, **this day** means the tenth day of the first month of every year. On this day every year, they must celebrate the Passover. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
12:15	xsb9			אַ֚ךְ	1	Alternate translation: “Surely” or “Indeed”

Alternate translation: “he must be sent away” (2) the person is no longer an Israelite. Alternate translation: “he will no longer be considered to be one of the people of Israel” (3) the person must die. Alternate translation: “he must be killed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

By whom that person will be cut off is not specified; it could be the Israelites or Yahweh. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The following alternate translations express those: (1) “the people of Israel must send him away” or (2) “I will no longer consider him to be one of the people of Israel” or (3) “the people of Israel must kill him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:15	eqzu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִ⁠יִּשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	**Israel** is a collective noun referring to the nation or people group. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “from the Israelites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
12:16	bzj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בַ⁠יּ֤וֹם הָ⁠רִאשׁוֹן֙ מִקְרָא־קֹ֔דֶשׁ וּ⁠בַ⁠יּוֹם֙ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִקְרָא־קֹ֖דֶשׁ יִהְיֶ֣ה לָ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:16	l7pj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כָּל־מְלָאכָה֙ לֹא־יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה בָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:17	r3qj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	צִבְאוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	The term **hosts** refers to a large group of people, often organized into groups for war.

The fourteenth day is near the beginning of April on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
12:18	uss3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths	י֣וֹם הָ⁠אֶחָ֧ד וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֛ים לַ⁠חֹ֖דֶשׁ	1	This is near the middle of April on Western calendars.

12:19	aej1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שְׂאֹ֕ר לֹ֥א יִמָּצֵ֖א בְּ⁠בָתֵּי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	This means there should not be any yeast in their houses. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Note that the UST more accurately conveys the meaning here, as the alternate translation in this note could be understood to mean that you must simply hide the yeast very well. Alternate translation: “Yahweh must not find any yeast in your houses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:19	vy72		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נִכְרְתָ֞ה הַ⁠נֶּ֤פֶשׁ הַ⁠הִוא֙ מֵ⁠עֲדַ֣ת יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	See how you translated **cut off** in [Exodus 12:15](../12/15.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If this plant is unknown, you can use a descriptor phrase. Alternate translation: “part of a plant with small branches and many leaves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:22	c1cf			אֶל־הַ⁠מַּשְׁקוֹף֙ וְ⁠אֶל־שְׁתֵּ֣י הַ⁠מְּזוּזֹ֔ת	1	Alternate translation: “on the sides and top of the way into the house.” See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 12:7](../12/07.md).

12:24	bzm0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	לְ⁠ךָ֥ וּ⁠לְ⁠בָנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **you** and **your** are singular but they refer to the whole nation. If the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of “you” in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
12:24	ch73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וּ⁠לְ⁠בָנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **sons** includes everyone. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the layers of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “to you what this ritual means to you,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
12:27	t779		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶת־בָּתֵּ֣י⁠נוּ הִצִּ֑יל	1	This means that Yahweh spared the Israelites’ firstborn sons.

12:28	r5cj			כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֧ה יְהוָ֛ה אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֥ה וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֖ן כֵּ֥ן עָשֽׂוּ	1	Alternate translation: “everything that Yahweh told Moses and Aaron to do”
12:29	rvg9				0	The next few verses are the climax of this part of Exodus. A number of literary features mark it out. First, it is specially introduced with **and so it happened,** which is used to mark major breaks in the narrative. Second, it uses repetition: **firstborn** is repeated four times in verse 29 so that the reader cannot possibly miss what is happening. **Night** is repeated in verse 29, 30, and 31. **Got up/get up** is repeated in verse 30 and 31. In verses 31 and 32 “also” occurs five times (it is translated as “both” once in the ULT). Third, the places of both **Pharaoh** and **the captive** are elaborated on to slow the pace and create a vivid mental image for the reader. In verse 30 there is the listing of sorts of people who got up; note the use of the double negative for emphasis. Your translation should attempt to use the same or similar literary features of your own language that slow down the pace, create vivid imagery, and emphasize that this is a climax point.

It both speaks of extreme parts of society and then makes this into a list by including the animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on the throne and the firstborn of the captive who was in the house of the pit and the firstborn of everyone in between was struck; even all the firstborn of the beasts were struck” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
12:29	uj6u			בְּכוֹר֮ & מִ⁠בְּכֹ֤ר & בְּכ֣וֹר & בְּכ֥וֹר	1	In these usages, **firstborn** always refers to the oldest male offspring. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 11:5](../11/05.md).

Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians saw the Israelites leaving Egypt, they gladly helped them (because they wanted them to leave so badly due to the Egyptians suffering under God’s judgment). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. See how you translated this in [3:21](../03/21.md).

Aviv is during the last part of March and the first part of April on Western calendars. You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])

13:18	c4tw			וַ⁠חֲמֻשִׁ֛ים	1	The meaning of this term (**by fives**) is uncertain. Many English translations opt for something like “prepared for battle,” because this seems to be the meaning in Numbers 32:17 and the related verses in Joshua 1:14 and 4:12. Because of what the previous verse said about war, it may mean that they went out in formation—like an army would march—but perhaps not armed. Alternate translation: “And … in formation like an army”

14:intro	jq4u				0	# Exodus 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis whole chapter is the record of an important event in the history of Israel known as the “parting of the sea of reeds (Red Sea).”\nThroughout this chapter and chapter 15, the word “sea” is used. Exodus 13:18 and 15:22 show that this is the sea of reeds (Red Sea). Since the text does not explicitly say that though, the ULT will only say “sea.” In your translation, it may help people to be more specific than the text if just using “sea” is confusing.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Pharaoh’s chariots\n\nThese chariots were a fighting force. Pharaoh took an army to kill the Hebrew people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nThe Israelites asked a few rhetorical questions of Moses.

15:intro	ni4b				0	# Exodus 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nVerses 1b-18 and 21b of chapter 15 are poetry. They are a song of praise to Yahweh because he defeated and destroyed the Egyptian army ([Exodus 14:26-28](../14/26.md)). Translating poetry should be done by someone who is a skilled poet in the target language. Because the forms of poetry are so different in different languages, a translation that is good poetry in the target language may seem very different from the original poem. The structure may look quite different. The poet will be well served by looking at the entire poem from multiple perspectives. He will need to know the meaning of the poem, the themes and discourse structure of the poem, and the feelings that the poem is supposed to create in the reader at each point (UST, tNotes). He will need to understand how that was accomplished by the original form and structure (ULT). Then he will need to compose the translated poem using forms and structures that have the same or similar meaning, themes, discourse elements, and feelings in his own language. Unlike in many other places, most notes in this chapter will not advise towards expressing meaning in non-figurative ways or combining parallel phrases as that advice would be too simplistic for handling poetry.\n\n### Structure\n\nThis song follows a basic AB structure which is given to us in verse 1b-c and 21b-c:\n\n* A - praise to Yahweh - he is magnificent (expressed in various words)\n* B - because he defeats our enemies\n\nThe song can be divided into three major sections, each of which is patterned as: AB(a)b. Each section starts with an AB portion which is characterized by fewer verbal forms (especially the A portion). The section then elaborates on each. Note that there are other possible analyses of the structure of the poem.\n\nHere is an outline of the structure according to this model:\n\n* Section 1 (see alternate breakdown below):\n* 1b: A “Let me sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphantly triumphed;”\n* 1c: B “the horse and the one riding it he threw into the sea.”\n* 2-3: a\n* 4-5: b\n* Section 2:\n* 6a: A\n* 6b: B\n* 7a: a “And in the abundance of your majesty”\n* 7a-10: b “you overthrow those who rise up against you … ”\n* Section 3:\n* 11: A\n* 12: B\n* 13a: a (possibly) “In your covenant loyalty”\n* 13a-17: b\n* 18: finale\n\nAlternate breakdown of section 1: it is possible to view 1b-c as the introduction and divide verse 2 such that:\n\n* 2a: A “Yah is my strength and my song”\n* 2b: B “and he has become my salvation”\n* 2c-3: a\n* 4-5: b\n\n### Themes:\n\nThere are several images and themes that are throughout the song as well as some that are throughout an individual section.\n\n* “High” versus “low”: Yahweh is high, while his enemies are low.\n* The following words are all related to the idea of being high or rising up: **triumph** ([v1](../15/01.md)), **exalt** ([v2](../15/02.md)), **majestic** ([v6](../15/06.md), [v11](../15/11.md)), **majesty** ([v7](../15/07.md)), and **the mountain of** \\[Yahweh’s\\] **possession** ([v17](../15/17.md)). In the last case, Yahweh’s people are brought to a high place with him.\n* In contrast, his enemies are low. Note in [verse 7](../15/07.md), Yahweh overthrows those who **rise up against** \\[him\\]. Ideas of being low are as follows: **sank** ([v4](../15/04.md), [v10](../15/19.md)), **deeps** ([v5](../15/05.md)), **descended into the depths** ([v5](../15/05.md)), **melted away** ([v15](../15/15.md)), and **fall on them** ([v16](../15/16.md)).\n* The strength of Yahweh in [verses 2](../15/02.md), [6](../15/06.md), and [13](../15/13.md).\n* The effectiveness of Yahweh’s hand versus the enemy’s hand. Yahweh’s hand (and arm) is effective in [verses 6](../15/06.md), [12](../15/12.md), [16](../15/16.md), and [17](../15/17.md) but the enemy’s hand is ineffective despite his boasting in [verse 9](../15/09.md).\n* There is parallel imagery near the end of each section. The enemy is compared three times by simile to a heavy, inert object. In [verses 5](../15/05.md) and [16](../15/16.md) that is a **stone**, in [verse 10](../15/10.md) that is **lead**.\n* More parallel imagery occurs at the end of sections one ([v5](../15/05.md)) and two ([v10](../15/10.md)): that of the enemy sinking in the water and being covered by it.\n* In sections two and three the water ([v8](../15/08.md)) and the other peoples ([v16](../15/16.md)) are made still by Yahweh.\n* Section two begins and ends with **majestic** ([v6](../15/06.md), [v10](../15/10.md)) and that word is picked up in the beginning of section three ([v11](../15/11.md)).\n* In section two ([v9](../15/09.md)), the enemies seek to **dispossess** (or disinherit) the Israelites; in section three ([v16](../15/16.md)), the Israelites come to live in the land of Yahweh’s **possession** (or inheritance).\n* In [verse 11](../15/11.md), three themes for the third section are introduced. These are each expanded on in that section.\n* **Holiness** occurs again in [verses 13](../15/13.md) and [16](../15/16.md)\n* **Fear** is vividly described in [verses 14-16](../15/14.md) (shake, terror, panic, trembling, melted away, dread)\n* Yahweh **does miracles** to protect and build a home for his people\n* [Verses 14-16a](../15/14.md) are a chiasm, a complex parallel structure where concepts are repeated in reverse order:\n* A: 14a: peoples (nations) *become* afraid\n* B: 14b: *inhabitants* of Philistia are afraid\n* C: 15a: *rulers* of Edom are afraid\n* C’: 15b: *rulers* of Moab are afraid\n* B’: 15c: *inhabitants* of Canaan are afraid\n* A’: 16a: people *become* afraid\n* In section three, there is another parallel structure:\n* [v13](../15/13.md): you led this people => [v16](../15/16.md): your people pass by\n* v13: this people you redeemed => v16: this people you acquired (or purchased or ransomed)\n* v13: you led them to the home => [v17](../15/17.md): you will bring them … \\[to\\] the place … you made\n* v13: of your holiness => v17: the Holy Place\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Israelite’s discontent\n\nIn [verse 24](../15/24.md) the word **murmur** is introduced for the first time. This is a very strong term for “grumble” or “complain” that is used to describe the Israelites’ attitude throughout their time in the wilderness. It occurs several times in Exodus and Numbers.\n\n### Yahweh’s laws\n\nIn verses [24-26](../15/24.md), there is an introductory revelation of the requirement that Israel keep the covenant by obeying the law of Moses.

15:9	lu0e			תּוֹרִישֵׁ֖⁠מוֹ יָדִֽ⁠י	1	The meaning of this phrase is unclear. The word translated **dispossess** could also mean “possess” or “inherit.” What seems clear is that the Egyptians plan to use their power to prevent the Israelites from possessing good things. Whether this is a reference back to **plunder** earlier in the verse or to recapturing them as slaves or to taking over the Israelites’ place in the land of Goshen or to keeping them from reaching the promised land (of Yahweh’s possession, see [verse 17](../15/17.md) regarding where Yahweh will bring his people) or something else is not so clear. It could also refer to taking away their life and breath. **Dispossess** was chosen rather than another term because the verb is in a causative form here. Alternate translation: “my hand will possess them” or “my hand will inherit them” or “my hand will kill them”
15:9	sm77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תּוֹרִישֵׁ֖⁠מוֹ יָדִֽ⁠י	1	Here **hand** is used figuratively of the Egyptians’ power (that is, their military strength).

16:intro	nkd7				0	# Exodus 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis entire chapter is the story of the Israelites complaining about food and Yahweh providing food. Verses 22-30 introduce the Sabbath.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Complaints\n\nAfter complaining about the water, the Israelites complained that they had less food than in Egypt. This is intended to show their ungratefulness and their sinful view of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Prohibition against storing food\n\nThe people were not allowed to store the food, called manna, that Yahweh provided to them. This is because they were to trust in Yahweh to provide for their needs every day. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])\n\n### Sabbath\n\nThis is the first recorded celebration of the Sabbath rest. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Bread as food\n\nYahweh speaks of the food that he will send as if it were bread. The manna he gave them was perhaps not literally bread. The Israelites would eat this food every day, just as they had eaten bread every day before this. Alternate translations: “food” or “food like bread” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/bread]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Chronology\n\n[Verses 34](../../exo/16/34.md)-36 are written from a much later perspective. Translators will need to find a way to show that this portion gives background information from a much later point (at least 40 years).\n\n### Box of the Covenant\n\nRelated to the chronology issue, although the covenant has not yet been made, it is referenced in [Exodus 16:34](../../exo/16/34.md). This is probably an editorial comment made after these events. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### Wilderness of Sin\n\nSin is the name of a part of the Sinai Wilderness. It is the description of a place, and it has nothing to do with sinning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
16:1	gw67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	סִ֔ין	1	The word **Sin** here is the Hebrew name of the wilderness. It is not the English word “sin.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])

16:3	g1n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יַד־יְהוָה֙	1	The phrase **the hand of Yahweh** represents Yahweh’s action.

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

So by complaining against them, the people were really complaining against Yahweh. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Your complaints are not really against us; they are against Yahweh, because we are his servants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Amalek’s, Yahweh’s, or Moses’? (2) What is the hand on (or against)? Yahweh’s throne or banner? (3) What is the meaning of the Hebrew preposition meaning on, against, or above?

18:intro	t8g2				0	# Exodus 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- v. 1-12: Jethro visits Moses and hears all that Yahweh has done\n- v. 13-27: Jethro observes Moses and advises him to set up a subsidiarity leadership structure; Moses does so\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Leadership lessons\n\nJethro taught Moses an important leadership lesson in this chapter. Many scholars look at this chapter for important leadership lessons. Moses delegated some of his responsibilities to other godly men so that he would not become worn out by all the demands made of him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties\n\n### Order of events\n\nThe timing of the events in [verse 2](../18/02.md) is not clear and, whatever their timing, may be difficult to translate. The question: Is Jethro’s **taking** Zipporah related to the past event of Moses sending her back to him at some otherwise unmentioned point in time, or is Jethro’s **taking** related to his coming to meet Moses in [verse 5](../18/05.md).\n\n### Verse 11\n\n[Verse 11](../18/11.md) is difficult in the original and requires interpretation.\n\n### God and Yahweh\n\nIn this chapter, God, who is named Yahweh in much of the rest of the book, is mostly referred to as God instead of by his name as is usual. Translations should not suggest that they are not different beings.\n\n### Kinship: Father-in-law\n\nJethro is the father of Moses’ wife. Some languages may make a distinction between that and a woman’s father-in-law. If that is the case, note it in verses: 1-2, 5-8, 12, 14-15, 17, 24, and 27. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])\n\n### Participant reference\n\nJethro is often referred to simply as the father-in-law of Moses in this chapter. He is also named explicitly (referred to by name) an unusually high number of times (it would be more usual to have more pronouns referring to him). Frequent use of his name is likely to emphasize his familial ties and authority (or honored status). Some languages may need to alter the way he is referred to for naturalness or to convey the same sense of familial ties and authority (or honored status).
18:1	nl86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	חֹתֵ֣ן מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	The label, **father-in-law of Moses** refers to the father of the wife of Moses. If your language uses a different term for a man’s father-in-law than for a woman’s father-in-law, choose the appropriate one here. Note the use of this term also in verses: 2, 5-8, 12, 14-15, 17, 24, and 27. Alternate translation: “the father of the wife of Moses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])

18:11	ljj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֥ר זָד֖וּ עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The most natural referent for **they** is **the gods**, who, perhaps through their agents (Pharaoh and the Egyptians), fought against Yahweh and oppressed the Israelites (**them**). This would connect back to [Exodus 12:12](../12/12.md) where Yahweh declares that he is bringing judgment on the gods of Egypt. You may need to make some part of this explicit. Alternate translation: “in which they proudly fought Yahweh by oppressing Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:12	voi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִֽים	1	Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of God. In this case it likely means that this was a worship event. Alternate translation: “in the presence of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “They told Moses about the difficult cases” or “When there were difficult cases, they told Moses about them so that he would judge them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

19:intro	ck7e				0	# Exodus 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter consist of a series of Moses going up Mount Sinai, talking to Yahweh, coming down, and talking to the people. He is being the intermediary, carrying messages between Yahweh and the people.\n- v. 1-2: Arrival at Sinai\n- v. 3-8: First cycle of Moses going up and down for instruction and response\n- v. 9-15: Second cycle, people get ready to hear God\n- v. 16-19: God speaks to the people from the mountain\n- v. 20-25: Third cycle\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “A kingdom of priests”\n\nThe function of the priests was to intercede for the people. The Levites were the only priests in Israel; this is a metaphor indicating that the nation was to intercede for the world as a whole. They were also to be holy, or set apart, from the rest of the world. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n### Revealing the law\n\nThe events of this chapter are concerned with preparing the people to receive the law of Moses. The people go through all of this to prepare themselves for the law, which shows the great importance of this event for Israel. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Boundaries between Yahweh and the people\n\nMoses is told to make the people holy in preparation for meeting Yahweh, then boundaries are set up to keep the people separate from Yahweh, and then the priests are told to make themselves holy. The theme of a holy separation is beginning to be developed that will become much of the law code.

This may be for poetic effect, as Yahweh’s statement here through [verse 6](../19/06.md) is somewhat artfully crafted. You may need to use a strategy other than parallelism to achieve a similar poetic effect in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
19:4	z9i6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	אַתֶּ֣ם רְאִיתֶ֔ם	1	The word **you** here refers to the Israelites. Yahweh is telling Moses what to tell the Israelites. If your language has a plural form of you, you would need it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

19:12	hhv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר הִשָּׁמְר֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֛ם	1	A second-level direct quotation begins with **watch**. It is not clear where this command that Moses is to give the Israelites ends. Most English translations end it in [verse 13](../19/13.md) before the last sentence. For that reason, it may be most helpful to translate the instruction as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “telling them to watch themselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

19:13	ezpm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	יַעֲל֥וּ	1	If you translate this with come or go, consider which would be the correct perspective for your language and the text context. Yahweh is speaking, so “come up” is valid; however, the people will be the ones moving, so “go up” is valid as well. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
19:15	bw2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	אַֽל־תִּגְּשׁ֖וּ אֶל־אִשָּֽׁה	1	This is a polite way of talking about sexual relations.

19:18	m1b5			יָרַ֥ד & יְהוָ֖ה	1	Alternate translation: “Yahweh came down”
19:18	a8p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠עֶ֣שֶׁן הַ⁠כִּבְשָׁ֔ן	1	This shows that it was a very large amount of smoke.

See how you translated “set bounds” in [Exodus 19:12](../19/12.md). If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “not to go beyond the boundary” or “not to go through the barrier” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
19:21	oht2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠נָפַ֥ל	1	Here, **fall** refers to dying. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant.

Alternate translation: “Do not build steps up to the altar and go up to it on those steps” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

21:intro	dnd3				0	# Exodus 21 General Notes\n\nThis chapter begins to give the Israelite civil case law, that is, the explanation of how to apply the principles condensed in the ten commandments.\n\n## Structure:\n\n- 1: Introduction\n- 2-6: Laws regarding male slaves\n- 7-11: Laws regarding female slaves\n- 12-17: Capital crimes\n- 18-36: Liability laws\n    * 18-27: Regarding human violence\n    * 28-36: Regarding damage done by or to animals\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Hypothetical situations\n\nThroughout the case law, a hypothetical situation is introduced with “when” or “if.” It is followed by a description of the situation; then there is the penalty or action to be taken in those situations. A hypothetical person may be introduced with “anyone” or “whoever.” Most verses for the next several chapters will have these hypothetical situations. See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]] Translators familiar with Hebrew may want to notice that, generally, major divisions are introduced by כִּי (ki) and minor divisions within a topic are introduced by אִם (’im).\n\n### Passive construction\n\nMany portions of these situations are written in the passive voice. Some languages may have to change all or some of these to active voice. See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]].\n\n### Daughters sold as servants\n\nThe section from [verses 7-11](../21/07.md) may be somewhat confusing because a daughter that is sold as a servant is seamlessly connected to her becoming someone’s wife. It seems the two things could be closely related.\n\n### Ransom payment\n\nIn [verse 30](../21/30.md) a man whose bull killed someone may evade the death penalty by paying a ransom price, but the conditions for that happening are not clear.

See the [introduction to chapter 21](../21/intro.md). You will need to translate these consistently in a manner that expresses that these situations have not happened. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
21:3	ln3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־בְּ⁠גַפּ֥⁠וֹ יָבֹ֖א בְּ⁠גַפּ֣⁠וֹ יֵצֵ֑א	1	What **by himself** means can be stated clearly. Some languages require that the additional condition, that he marries while a slave, be stated clearly.

21:6	vnjk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָ֣⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	The word for **God** at its most literal means “great ones.” Here it may have this basic meaning and refer to human judges or other leaders in Israel. It may also be a metonym and refer to the judges because they represent God to the people and have his authority. Texts other than the standard Hebrew text support this reading. See [Exodus 22:8-9](../22/08.md) for another example of this. Alternate translation: “the judges” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
21:6	z8x1			וְ⁠רָצַ֨ע & אֶת־אָזְנ⁠וֹ֙	1	Alternate translation: “and … will put a hole in his ear”

21:8	p8se			יְעָדָ֖⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: “has chosen her”
21:8	t2zf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הֶפְדָּ֑⁠הּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “then he must allow her father to buy her back” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:8	h7f7			בְּ⁠בִגְד⁠וֹ־בָֽ⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: “since he has deceived her”

Alternate translation: “he must give the first wife the same food, clothing, and marital rights she had before” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
21:10	np9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠עֹנָתָ֖⁠הּ	1	This term only occurs here in the Bible. It probably means things that a husband must do for his wife. Most commentators believe it specifically means having sexual relations with her, possibly so that she can bear children. Alternate translation: “or her right to intimacy” or “or her childbearing rights” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
21:12	gks4			מַכֵּ֥ה אִ֛ישׁ	1	Alternate translation: “Whoever attacks a man”
21:12	su6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must certainly execute that person” or “you must certainly kill that person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:13	h4ka			וַ⁠אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א צָדָ֔ה	1	Alternate translation: “But if he did not plan to do it” or “But if he did not do it on purpose”

Alternate translation: “I will choose a place to which he can run away to be safe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:14	st5h			בְ⁠עָרְמָ֑ה	1	Alternate translation: “after thinking carefully about it”
21:14	abx6			תִּקָּחֶ֖⁠נּוּ	1	The word “him” refers to the one who killed his neighbor.
21:14	mvpx			לָ⁠מֽוּת	1	Alternate translation: “to execute him”
21:15	y3hd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠מַכֵּ֥ה אָבִ֛י⁠ו וְ⁠אִמּ֖⁠וֹ מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “If anyone hits his father or mother, you must surely put him to death” or “You must surely kill anyone who hits his father or mother” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:15	qh2j			מ֥וֹת	1	Alternate translation: “certainly”
21:16	iu81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must kill that kidnapper” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:17	h8qf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠מְקַלֵּ֥ל אָבִ֛י⁠ו וְ⁠אִמּ֖⁠וֹ מ֥וֹת יוּמָֽת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You must surely kill anyone who curses his father or his mother” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

21:19	c7rv			יָק֞וּם	1	Alternate translation: “he gets better”
21:19	tv0z			וְ⁠נִקָּ֣ה	1	Alternate translation: “then … is innocent”
21:19	xg6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שִׁבְתּ֛⁠וֹ	1	This refers to a situation when someone cannot work to earn money. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the time he could not work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:19	ws14			וְ⁠רַפֹּ֥א יְרַפֵּֽא	1	Alternate translation: “and for his medical costs” or “and for his costs for healing”
21:20	te41			תַּ֣חַת יָד֑⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: “because of the injury” or “because the master hit him”

21:21	r65u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ֥י כַסְפּ֖⁠וֹ הֽוּא	1	A common view is that the loss of the valuable property, the slave, is itself a punishment. It may be that the master loses the slave for a time and also has to pay for his healing, or it may be that the slave dies after a few days. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that the servant was valuable to his master explicitly. Alternate translation: “because he has already lost his servant who was valuable to him” or “because he has already lost his servant’s work for a time and had to pay for his healing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:22	a6av			וְ⁠יָצְא֣וּ יְלָדֶ֔י⁠הָ וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִהְיֶ֖ה אָס֑וֹן	1	It is not clear in the passage what happens to the child. The text is simply as in the ULT. Some have taken it to mean that the child dies because of premature birth, and the **serious injury** only relates to the woman. In this case, a fine is imposed for the loss of the child. However, the text could also mean that the child is born safely. A fine is still imposed because of the great danger to the two lives. Then the next few verses give consequences for any injury either to mother or child.
21:22	w4p3			אָס֑וֹן	1	Alternate translation: “hurt”
21:22	cn4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עָנ֣וֹשׁ יֵעָנֵ֗שׁ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must certainly fine the guilty man” or “the guilty man must pay a fine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:22	v5ye			בִּ⁠פְלִלִֽים	1	Alternate translation: “what the judges decide”
21:23	ya82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נָתַתָּ֥ה נֶ֖פֶשׁ תַּ֥חַת נָֽפֶשׁ	1	This means that if someone is hurt, the person who caused the hurt must be hurt in the same way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you must take the killer’s life for the murdered person’s life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:24	c5bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֚יִן תַּ֣חַת עַ֔יִן	1	This means that if someone is hurt, the person who caused the hurt must be hurt in the same way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the striker’s eye for the injured person’s eye” (and repeated in like manner for each example throughout this and the next verse) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:26	i8cg			אִ֜ישׁ	1	Here, **man** refers to the owner of a slave.
21:26	bmc1			תַּ֥חַת	1	Alternate translation: “as payment for”
21:28	sp6w			יִגַּ֨ח שׁ֥וֹר	1	Alternate translation: “an ox injures with its horns”
21:28	qk3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	סָק֨וֹל יִסָּקֵ֜ל הַ⁠שּׁ֗וֹר	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must surely stone the ox to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:28	q2gv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֤א יֵאָכֵל֙ אֶת־בְּשָׂר֔⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and you must not eat its flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:29	zgll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הוּעַ֤ד בִּ⁠בְעָלָי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְרֶ֔⁠נּוּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state **its owner was warned** in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and someone warned its owner but he did not keep it in” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:29	x2y0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הוּעַ֤ד בִּ⁠בְעָלָי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְרֶ֔⁠נּוּ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the content of the warning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and its owner was warned that it gores but he did not keep it in” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:29	nzn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠גַם־בְּעָלָ֖י⁠ו יוּמָֽת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and you must also kill its owner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:30	t5rs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־כֹּ֖פֶר יוּשַׁ֣ת עָלָ֑י⁠ו וְ⁠נָתַן֙ פִּדְיֹ֣ן נַפְשׁ֔⁠וֹ כְּ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־יוּשַׁ֖ת עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The text does not specify who will impose a ransom on the ox’s owner. Since other texts indicate that justice is retributive and performed by the dead person’s family, that is one option. Another option is that the judges will impose it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express one of these explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:30	py37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אִם־כֹּ֖פֶר יוּשַׁ֣ת עָלָ֑י⁠ו & יוּשַׁ֖ת עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. However, you must make a decision regarding who is imposing the ransom or use an unspecified pronoun, if that is possible in your language (this second option would not make sense in English). Alternate translation: “If the judges impose a ransom on him … they impose on him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:31	kg25			יִגָּ֖ח & יִגָּ֑ח	1	Alternate translation: “it injures with its horns … it injures with its horns”
21:31	to8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **him** probably refers to the ox’s owner. Alternate translation: “to the owner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
21:32	qzv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	כֶּ֣סֶף׀ שְׁלֹשִׁ֣ים שְׁקָלִ֗ים	1	In ancient times, a silver shekel weighed about 11 grams or about a third of an ounce. You could try to express the equivalent in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. Instead, you could say something general like “30 silver coins” or give the equivalent weight or use the biblical term in the text and explain the weight in a footnote. Alternate translation: “330 grams of silver” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
21:32	qy0g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־עֶ֛בֶד יִגַּ֥ח הַ⁠שּׁ֖וֹר	1	Because they are to kill the ox, the slave must have died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If an ox kills a male servant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:32	wm9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הַ⁠שּׁ֖וֹר יִסָּקֵֽל	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you must kill the ox by stoning it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:33	fd4p			יִפְתַּ֨ח & בּ֗וֹר	1	Alternate translation: “uncovers a hole in the ground” or “takes a cover off a hole in the ground”
21:34	b48a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כֶּ֖סֶף יָשִׁ֣יב לִ⁠בְעָלָ֑י⁠ו	1	The owner must be paid for the loss of his animal. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he must pay the owner for the dead animal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:34	ip1n			יְשַׁלֵּ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: “must make restitution”
21:34	j8qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠מֵּ֖ת יִֽהְיֶה־לּֽ⁠וֹ	1	The one who paid for the loss of the animal will become the owner of the dead animal and can do what he wants with it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the dead animal will belong to the owner of the pit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:35	z9ug			וְ⁠חָצ֣וּ אֶת־כַּסְפּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: “and divide the money” or “and divide the money they receive”
21:36	fkx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	א֣וֹ נוֹדַ֗ע	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:36	v64b			נַגָּ֥ח הוּא֙ מִ⁠תְּמ֣וֹל שִׁלְשֹׁ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: “the ox had gored other animals before”
21:36	ix8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִשְׁמְרֶ֖⁠נּוּ בְּעָלָ֑י⁠ו	1	This means that the owner did not keep his ox safely where it could not wander to hurt other animals. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and its owner did not keep it inside a fence” or “and its owner did not tie it securely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:36	dcv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שַׁלֵּ֨ם יְשַׁלֵּ֥ם שׁוֹר֙ תַּ֣חַת הַ⁠שּׁ֔וֹר	1	The owner of the ox that killed must give an ox to the man who lost his ox. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the owner of the ox that killed must surely give a living ox to the owner of the ox that died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])

Their continued blessings were contingent upon their obedience to this covenant. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### God’s holiness\n\nBecause Yahweh is perfectly holy, he can only be approached in a certain way. Because of this, only Moses was allowed near Yahweh. This is also why Yahweh is described as a “devouring fire.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

Following this, you can view this verse as if Moses paused and gave these final instructions as he was leaving the elders behind, thus keeping a sequential structure.

25:intro	t23a				0	# Exodus 25 General Notes\n\n## Structure:\n\n* v. 1-7: Instructions for gifts the Israelites may give to help build the place where they will worship God\n* v. 8-9: Introductory building instructions\n* v. 10-22: Instructions for building the Box of the Testimony\n* v. 23-30: Instructions for building the table\n* v. 31-39: Instructions for building the lampstand\n* v. 40: Summary instruction\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n* The tent of meeting and Box of the Testimony are introduced in this chapter.\n* Translators will need to take special care in translating the concept of atonement.\n\n## Potential Translation Issues in this Chapter:\n\n* There are many unfamiliar items in this chapter. Fortunately they are mostly all physical items. Translators will have to try to understand what each item is and translate it into the closest equivalent in their culture. It may be helpful for translators to try to find images depicting some of the items the Israelites were to make.\n* There are some biblical weights and measurements that translators may not have encountered before.\n* From [verse 11](../25/11.md) until the end of chapter 30, almost every instruction regarding the construction of the tent of meeting and all the associated items are given with a singular form of “you,” as if Moses himself would make them. However, it is clear and made explicit in [chapter 31](../31/01.md) that certain skilled craftsmen will receive these instructions from Moses and make these items. In some languages you may need to change from second to third person throughout, following the pattern in [25:10](../25/10.md). There are a few exceptions which will have their own note. See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]].
25:2	ygtd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	דַּבֵּר֙	1	The beginning of this verse marks the start of a very long direct quote which continues until the end of [Exo 30:10](../30/10.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
25:2	tktu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	דַּבֵּר֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְ⁠יִקְחוּ־לִ֖⁠י תְּרוּמָ֑ה	1	In some languages you may have to make **and they shall take a contribution for me** a direct quote. Note that this will make it a second-level quotation and you will need to mark it with second-level quotation marking if your language uses them. Alternate translation: “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘You shall take a contribution for me.’ ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
25:2	r5yr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִדְּבֶ֣⁠נּוּ לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	This is an idiom that indicates a person’s desire to give an offering.

25:9	tc2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	תַּעֲשֽׂוּ	1	Since Moses does not construct these items himself, you may consider shifting the instructions to the third person if it would be clearer in your language.

If this sort of metal-working process is unknown to your people, you may simply describe it, or use a word meaning “make,” as the UST does. The UST approach is preferred, as the creation process is not in focus here, and it would be cumbersome to include the description in the text. You could use a word meaning “make,” and include the description in a footnote if you are including those and your team feels it is important to understand. Alternate translation: “You shall make four rings of gold by melting the gold and pouring it into molds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

It may, however, mean that at the end they should be one piece, so the gold should be heated to melting and the lid and cherubim joined together. Alternate translation: “You shall join the cherubim to the atonement lid on its two ends”
25:22	zu9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לְ⁠ךָ֮ & אִתְּ⁠ךָ֜ & אוֹתְ⁠ךָ֖	1	Here, **you** is singular and refers to Moses.

25:27	jdh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠בָתִּ֣ים	1	Here, **to house the poles** means that the rings will hold the poles.

It is likely that the **plates** were mostly flat dishes for holding the bread that would be on the table. The **pans** may have been shallow bowls or deep plates for holding incense, or they may have been something more like a ladle or spoon. The **pitchers** probably held wine to be poured into the **bowls** for the drink offerings. You will need to translate using the closest word for each such item in your culture.

This chapter is really one united whole; the outline below is one possible way of subdividing it.\nThe Consecration of the Priests\n- v. 1-3 Preparing items\n- v. 4-9 Preparing Aaron and his sons\n- v. 10-14 Sacrificing the bull to purify the altar\n- v. 15-34 Sacrificing the rams\n    * v. 15-18 The first ram wholly burned\n    * v. 19-28 The second ram used for consecrating and divided for eating\n    * v. 29-30 Priestly succession\n    * v. 31-34 More instructions regarding eating the second ram\n- v. 35-37 Instructions to do all this for seven days\n- v. 38-41 Instructions for perpetual offerings\n- v. 42-46 Yahweh’s affirmation\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Consecrating priests\n\nThis chapter records the process of consecrating priests. The priests were to be set apart from the rest of Israel because Yahweh is holy. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/consecrate]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Forms of you\n\nFor this chapter, it seems that the singular “you: that Yahweh has been using to give Moses general instructions for the last several chapters now actually refers to Moses himself. If you have been translating the instructions using a plural form of you or by shifting the instructions to the third person, you should switch back to a singular form referring directly to Moses for this chapter.\n\n### “I will live among the Israelites”\n\nAs God, Yahweh is everywhere and cannot be limited to a single space. This phrase indicates that he permanently remains within Israel in a special way while they have the ark.

You may need to shorten the sentences and make the alternate translation content separate sentences or mark it off with special punctuation.

29:6	n4bt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֶת־נֵ֥זֶר הַ⁠קֹּ֖דֶשׁ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **holiness**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the holy crown” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
29:7	rwuj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שֶׁ֣מֶן הַ⁠מִּשְׁחָ֔ה	1	See how you translated **oil of anointing** in [25:6](../25/06.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

29:9	jhwb			וּ⁠מִלֵּאתָ֥ יַֽד־אַהֲרֹ֖ן וְ⁠יַד־בָּנָֽי⁠ו	1	The phrase, **fill the hand** may be (1) a summary and reminder statement of the whole ordination process, (2) referring to the previous description, meaning that the priests have been ordained, or (3) referring to the following description, meaning that the priests are about to be ordained. It would probably be best to translate this in the way a mid-text summary reminder phrase would be spoken in your language, avoiding any indication that it refers only to the previous or following text.

If this form would not express that this item would become uniquely holy in your language you may need to find another way to express this idea. See how you translated this in [Exodus 29:37](../29/37.md). Alternate translation: “a most holy thing” or “extraordinarily holy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

30:14	uqt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כֹּ֗ל הָ⁠עֹבֵר֙ עַל־הַ⁠פְּקֻדִ֔ים	1	This is an idiom that suggests that the men were counted by walking past someone who was counting people as they walked by. It is the same phrase as in the [previous verse](../30/13.md). Alternate translation: “Everyone counted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
30:14	vhim		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠בֶּ֛ן עֶשְׂרִ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה	1	This is an idiom that refers to age. See the UST and how you translated the same idiom in [Exo 7:7](../07/07.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

30:15	ew8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	נַפְשֹׁתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	The plural form of you is used here. In many cases, since Yahweh is speaking to Moses about the people that will be counted, it may make more sense to change to the third person. However, Moses would be counted as well and would have to pay the ransom, so a form of you that could include Moses and all the other Israelite men would also be an appropriate translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
30:24	dv89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume	הִֽין	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the quantity in modern measurements.

32:intro	vv2w				0	# Exodus 32 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe events in verses 1-6 of this chapter occured while Moses spoke with God and therefore happened sometime during the events recorded between Exodus 24:15 and Exodus 31. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])\n\n- v. 1-6: The people ask Aaron to make them a god and he makes the golden calf\n- v. 7-29 - Yahweh and Moses’ reaction\n   * v. 11-14 - Moses intercedes for the people\n- v. 30-34 - Moses intercedes for the people\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 32:18.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Idolatry\n\nThe making of the golden calf was considered a form of idolatry. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

32:1	cfk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	Here, the word **saw** is used to indicate understanding or realization of a situation. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “And the people realized” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
32:1	lnau		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וַ⁠יִּקָּהֵ֨ל הָ⁠עָ֜ם	1	This means the people both decided to gather and were the ones gathering. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
32:1	k2i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֣וּם	1	**Arise** strengthens the force of the command following it. The people were demanding that Aaron make an idol for them. It did not necessarily mean that he should literally stand up. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
32:1	mrb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יֵֽלְכוּ֙ לְ⁠פָנֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	Here, **before our faces** means ahead of. The Israelites want idols to lead them. Alternate translation: “shall lead us” or “shall be our leader” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
32:1	wulk			כִּי־זֶ֣ה׀ מֹשֶׁ֣ה	1	People showed disrespect by putting the word **this** before his name, as if Moses were someone they did not know and could not trust. They were creating social distance between him and themselves. When translating, use a form in your language that communicates the same sense of disassociation between people.
32:2	p86s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הָבִ֖יאוּ	1	Here, **them** refers to the golden rings. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
32:3	ckg2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	This refers to all the people who rejected Moses as their leader and Yahweh as their God. Later parts of the text reveal that there were people still faithful to Moses and Yahweh and that the Israelites had a great deal more gold. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that means many or most. Alternate translation: “many people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

When the gold cooled and became hard, he removed the mold, and the hardened gold had the shape of a calf. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
32:4	cc7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ	1	The identity of the speakers, referred to as **they**, remains unknown. Alternate translation: “And someone said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
32:4	ence		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ & הֶעֱל֖וּ⁠ךָ	1	Because the speaker of this sentence is unknown and mentioned in the plural, it is possible that it is the people speaking. In that case, it would be possible for a translation to use the first person rather than second person here. Alternate translation: “These are our gods … brought us up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
32:4	n17v			אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	In the text, there only appears to be one “god” (the golden calf idol) presented to Israel. If it would be clearer to your audience, you may consider translating **these … gods** as singular. Alternate translation: “this is your god”
32:5	ztx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא אַהֲרֹ֔ן	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express what he saw explicitly. “Aaron saw what the people did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

32:5	p2df		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠פָנָ֑י⁠ו	1	Here, **it** is the golden bull-calf. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in front of the bull-calf idol” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
32:6	as6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	לְ⁠צַחֵֽק	1	This word may imply drunken and sexual sin (for a sexual implication see [Genesis 26:8](../GEN/26/08)). However, the only actions mentioned in the text are singing ([v. 18](../32/18.md)) and dancing ([v. 19](../32/19.md)), so translators should avoid using a term that is overly suggestive. Alternate translation: “to revel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
32:7	iajs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	to carouse in wild celebration	0	Here there is a scene shift back to the top of the mountain with Moses and Yahweh, which may need to be marked in a certain way in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
32:7	tcek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	שִׁחֵ֣ת	1	Here, **themselves** is used to indicate that the Israelites actions made the Israelites corrupt.

32:8	eua5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	סָ֣רוּ מַהֵ֗ר מִן־הַ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר צִוִּיתִ֔⁠ם	1	Here God speaks of the people disobeying what he commanded them as if he had told them to walk on a certain road, and they left that road. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “They have quickly stopped doing what I commanded them to do” or “They have quickly stopped obeying what I commanded them to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
32:8	tg9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר הֶֽעֱל֖וּ⁠ךָ מֵ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרָֽיִם	1	This is a second-level direct quotation.

32:8	sjj1			אֵ֤לֶּה אֱלֹהֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	In the text, there only appears to be one “god” (the golden calf idol) presented to Israel.

32:9	ffe2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֖רֶף	1	Yahweh speaks of the people being rebellious as if they had hard necks. The image comes from an animal that does not want to go the way his master is trying to direct him (not going in the way God commanded). If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “is a rebellious people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
32:9	my87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה & הֽוּא	1	The word **people** is a collective noun, so the pronouns referring to the people are singular.

32:10	fmk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּה֙	1	**So now** is used here to mark that Yahweh’s next statements are a result of what he has said in the previous verses. Alternate translation: “Therefore” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
32:10	sd9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִֽחַר־אַפִּ֥⁠י בָ⁠הֶ֖ם	1	This is an idiom meaning that Yahweh is angry.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, do not let your nose burn against your people whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: If you destroy your people, the Egyptians might say, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from on the face of the ground.’ (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

This imagery may not translate into your language, and you may need to use a different expression. Alternate translation: “Calm down, and please do not stay determined to do evil to your people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “Yahweh had written on both the sides of the tablets, on this side and on that side he had written.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
32:16	w3ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠לֻּחֹ֔ת מַעֲשֵׂ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים הֵ֑מָּה וְ⁠הַ⁠מִּכְתָּ֗ב מִכְתַּ֤ב אֱלֹהִים֙ ה֔וּא	1	These two sentences have an unusual structure that places emphasis on **tablets** and **writing**. If your language would emphasize these topics in a different way than moving them to the beginning of the sentence, follow your language’s natural usage for emphasis. Alternate translation: “And the tablets themselves were the work of God. And the writing itself was the writing of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
32:17	cua3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	יְהוֹשֻׁ֛עַ	1	Joshua was last mentioned in [Exodus 24:13](../24/13.md). The text does not say if he was on top of the mountain with Moses or if he waited for him part way up. Consider if your language will need to re-introduce Joshua in any way here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

It is not clear why a poetic form is used here. In some languages it may not be appropriate to convey this response in poetic form, in which case another form may be used. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

If it would be unclear to say that Moses heard **the sound of singing** in the third line after saying he didn’t hear the sound of singing twice before, something more like the more contrastive UST may be followed. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
32:18	fdg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ק֣וֹל עַנּ֔וֹת אָנֹכִ֖י שֹׁמֵֽעַ	1	If it is unclear to say that Moses hears **the sound of singing** after twice saying he didn’t hear that, you may want to make the type of singing explicit. Consider referring to your translation of the last word of [verse 6](../32/06.md) (to play in the ULT). Alternate translation: “the sound of playful singing I hear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the layers of quotations in this passage.

32:22	z2ch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַל־יִ֥חַר אַ֖ף	1	This is an idiom for anger. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Do not be angry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
32:22	vdy2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּ֥י בְ⁠רָ֖ע הֽוּא	1	This is probably an idiom that could mean (1) that the people are prone to evil or (2) that the people were in trouble (that is, they felt troubled because of not having contact with God). If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “that they are set on evil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
32:22	h6dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הֽוּא	1	Here, **it** is used because **people** is grammatically singular in Hebrew. Alternate translation: “they are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
32:23	zn68			זֶ֣ה׀ מֹשֶׁ֣ה הָ⁠אִ֗ישׁ	1	People showed disrespect by putting the word **this** before his name, as if Moses were someone they did not know and could not trust. They were creating social distance between him and themselves. When translating, use a form in your language that communicates the same sense of disassociation between people. See how you translated this in [verse 1](../32/01.md).

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, this can be stated as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: “So I told them that whoever had any gold should take it off” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
32:24	yy82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	הִתְפָּרָ֖קוּ	1	Aaron instructs people to take their own gold off. Alternate translation: “you take off your own” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

The translation should surprise an audience unfamiliar with the story. He states that the result of simply throwing gold in the fire is the apperance (by its own power or volition it seems) of the calf. This is a lie. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
32:25	ck1f			פָרֻ֖עַ	1	Alternate translation: “were behaving wildly” or “were not controlling themselves”

If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “that they were let loose, for Aaron had let them loose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
32:26	jis7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר מִ֥י לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה אֵלָ֑⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as an indirect quotation.

32:29	to5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִלְא֨וּ יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם	1	This seems to be an idiom for giving authority to someone. See how you translated this in [Exodus 28:41](../28/41.md). However, this usage is different from that text, as here it is not specified what authority they are given or what they are consecrated for other than **for Yahweh**. Alternate translation: “Consecrate yourselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
32:29	rkp6			מִלְא֨וּ יֶדְ⁠כֶ֤ם הַ⁠יּוֹם֙ לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה	1	Here it is unclear if **fill** should be rightly understood as in the past or as a new command. You may want to follow the decision of another translation your people are familiar with. Alternate translation: “You have filled your hand for Yahweh today”
32:29	c6fg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ֛י אִ֥ישׁ בִּ⁠בְנ֖⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְ⁠אָחִ֑י⁠ו	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the fact that they did this in obedience to God explicitly. Alternate translation: “For you have obeyed Yahweh, because each man was against his son and against his brother” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
32:29	l54l			וְ⁠לָ⁠תֵ֧ת עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֛ם הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם בְּרָכָֽה	1	This phrase is difficult to interpret. Several options depend on exactly how the conjunction, preposition, and verb combination are interpreted. The first difficulty is related to the difficulty with the previous verb: have they already been blessed or are they going to be blessed? (Alternate translation: “to have put a blessing on yourselves today”) The second difficulty is: should the clause connections be understood to say that the blessing is because of their actions, or more strongly, that a desire for blessing motivated them to take action? (Alternate translation: “and therefore a blessing is put on you today” or “so that a blessing may be put over you today”) The third difficulty is: while ultimately all blessing is from Yahweh, which is the subject here, Yahweh or the Levites? (Alternate translation: “and so Yahweh is putting a blessing on you today”) As with the previous clause, you may want to follow the decision of another translation your people are familiar with. Alternate translation: “, by that you brought blessing on yourselves”
32:30	kvj4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	חֲטָאתֶ֖ם חֲטָאָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה	1	Here, **sin** used as a verb and then repeated as a noun for emphasis.

However, if leaving out a conclusion would be misunderstood in your language you may need to rephrase it or add the implied conclusion. Alternate translation: “But now, if you forgive their sin, good!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
32:32	c72y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מְחֵ֣⁠נִי	1	Here, **me** refers to the name of Moses. Alternate translation: “erase my name from” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “However, because they sinned, one day I will come to punish them.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they were guilty along with Aaron of making the calf” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

33:intro	g5k3				0	# Exodus 33 General Notes\n\nThis chapter is largely about Moses continuing to negotiate for a closer relationship between Yahweh and himself and Yahweh and the people. There are a number of important theological issues addressed, especially Yahweh’s holiness and character. Several key terms appear.\n\n## Structure:\n- v. 1-6: Moses negotiating with Yahweh to go with Israel\n- v. 7-11: the temporary tent of meeting\n- v. 12-23: Moses negotiating with Yahweh to see his glory\n\n## Potential Translation Issues\n\nYahweh’s statement to Moses in verse 5 seems to have happened before the people’s reaction in verse 4, so in some languages you may need to reverse them.\n\nVerses 7-11 seem to be background, general information about a somewhat unspecified time period. Be sure this is clear in how you structure these verses. See the beginning of verse 7 in the UST. While the term in verses 7-11 is often used interchangeably with the Dwelling that will be built in chapters 35-39, it is a temporary and different tent. One distinguishing feature is that it is well outside the camp, while the Dwelling will be in the center of the camp.\n\nThe word **tent** in verses 7-11 refers either to this temporary “tent of meeting” that Moses set up or to the tents that the Israelites lived in. Pay attention throughout these verses to which tent is referred to.

33:4	qwuu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	jewelry	0	Yahweh’s statement to Moses in verse 5 seems to have happened before the people’s reaction in verse 4, so in some languages you may need to reverse them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
33:5	rn40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1	The word **had** places Yahweh’s statement back in time. It can be understood from context as Yahweh’s statement to Moses in verse 5 seems to have happened before the people’s reaction in verse 4. If you are reversing the order of the verses for your language, you should adjust the verbal sequencing in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

33:13	e6vv			מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֜ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֗י⁠ךָ & אֶמְצָא־חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **found favor in your eyes** is an idiom that means that God is pleased with Moses. You may also need to make the phrase active in form and change the abstract noun **favor** into another form. Finally, **in your eyes** is a metaphor representing his evaluation. See how you dealt with the multiple issues in the phrase **you have found favor in my eyes** in [Exodus 33:12](../33/12.md).
33:13	zi7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הוֹדִעֵ֤⁠נִי נָא֙ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Here, **ways** is a metaphor either: (1) for Yahweh’s plans or (2) for the holy life he requires. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: (1) “please cause me to know what you are going to do in the future” (2) “please cause me to know how people can do what pleases you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
33:13	gtv4			אֶמְצָא־חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	This instance of the phrase **find favor in your eyes** means in the future. Consider how to translate it in your language to convey an on-going situation. Alternate translation: “I can always find favor in your eyes”
33:13	o1ew			וּ⁠רְאֵ֕ה כִּ֥י עַמְּ⁠ךָ֖ הַ⁠גּ֥וֹי הַ⁠זֶּֽה׃	1	Moses is requesting that Yahweh would again **see**, perceive, consider, or recognize the Israelites as his special people. In this way, Moses would know that Yahweh had truly forgiven them.
33:14	gh8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פָּנַ֥⁠י יֵלֵ֖כוּ	1	Yahweh’s **face** represents his presence, which represents himself. Alternate translation: “I will go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

The first rhetorical question, “**And in what then will it be known that I have found favor in your eyes, I and your people?**” is used for emphasis and means, “There is only one way people will know that I and your people please you.” The second, “**Is it not in your going with us?**” is used to answer the first question and means “That way is your going with us.” It is possible that the rest of the verse is (1) a statement further clarifying how Yahweh’s favor is demonstrated (ULT, UST), (2) an extension of the second rhetorical question (“Is it not in your going with us so that I and your people shall be distinct from all of the people that are on the face of the earth?”), or (3) a separate rhetorical question making the same point (“And shall I and your people be distinct from all of the people that are on the face of the earth?”) Moses used these questions in order to emphasize that if Yahweh does not go with them, no one will know that Yahweh is pleased with Moses and the people. Use whatever forms would be natural in your language to present an argument like this. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
33:16	d36k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠בַ⁠מֶּ֣ה	1	This refers back to Moses’ hypothetical situation in the previous verse, that is, Yahweh not going with them. Use whatever connecting forms are necessary to make that clear. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

33:16	u82a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Here, **found favor** is an idiom that means that God is pleased with Moses. You may also need to make the phrase active in form and change the abstract noun **favor** into another form. Finally, **eyes** are a metonym for sight, and sight is a metaphor representing his evaluation. See how you dealt with the multiple issues in the phrase **you have found favor in my eyes** in [Exodus 33:12](../33/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

They stress Yahweh’s divine prerogative to do whatever he wants. The structure also parallels Yahweh’s I AM statements in [Exodus 3:14](../03/14.md). If this form of parallelism would be misunderstood in your language, consider another form that emphasizes that Yahweh is graciously kind to exactly those and only those to whom he chooses to show kindness, and he does so without outside influence.

There are a number of difficult terms and concepts.\n* The biblical metaphor of true worship as sexual fidelity appears in v. 14-16.\n* Several verses are repeated either exactly or closely from earlier chapters.\n* In v. 12-26 Yahweh appears to give a different 10 commandments from those in Exodus 20 (but also largely repeated from other earlier parts of Exodus), raising the question of what was actually written on the stone tablets in v. 28.\n* The concept of Moses’s shining face may be difficult in some cultures.\n\n### “He will bring the punishment for the fathers’ sin on their children”\n\nThis phrase does not mean that a child is necessarily punished for the sins of their parents.

34:7	hllt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	עָוֺ֛ן וָ⁠פֶ֖שַׁע וְ⁠חַטָּאָ֑ה	1	This list is meant to convey the idea of every kind of wrong. If a list like this would be misunderstood in your language you may need to use other terms or forms to make this point. Alternate translation: “every kind of sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
34:7	e2qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עָוֺ֛ן וָ⁠פֶ֖שַׁע וְ⁠חַטָּאָ֑ה & עֲוֺ֣ן	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **iniquity, transgression, and sin**, you can express the same ideas in another way., as modeled in the UST.

34:7	x397		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠נַקֵּה֙ לֹ֣א יְנַקֶּ֔ה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself. If this is confusing in your language, you may use the first person. Alternate translation: “But I will certainly not acquit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
34:7	ts1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠נַקֵּה֙ לֹ֣א יְנַקֶּ֔ה	1	Whom Yahweh will not acquit is not stated. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translations: “But he will certainly not clear the guilty” or “But he will certainly not say that the guilty are innocent” or “But he will certainly not free guilty people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
34:7	lyrg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עֲוֺ֣ן	1	Here, **iniquity** refers to the consequences or the punishment for iniquity. Alternate translation: “the punishment for the iniquity of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

This means that Yahweh makes the consequences of people’s sins affect their descendants. If your readers would not understand what this image means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “punishing the sons and the sons of the sons for the iniquity of the fathers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
34:7	c3tb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־בָּנִים֙ וְ⁠עַל־בְּנֵ֣י בָנִ֔ים	1	The references to **sons** and **sons of the sons** represents descendants. Alternate translation: “on their descendants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
34:7	d462		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁ֖ים וְ⁠עַל־רִבֵּעִֽים	1	Here, “generation” is implied after **third** and **fourth**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
34:7	pacu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁ֖ים וְ⁠עַל־רִבֵּעִֽים	1	Here, **third** and **fourth** means “several.” If this would not be understood and your language has a way of referring to an unspecified (but approximately 3-4) number, you may have to use it here. Alternate translation: “on a few generations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
34:8	c1qt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וַ⁠יִּשְׁתָּֽחוּ	1	Here, **himself** means that Moses did this action to his own body. Some languages may use a special form to indicate this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
34:8	mf8o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַ⁠יִּקֹּ֥ד אַ֖רְצָ⁠ה וַ⁠יִּשְׁתָּֽחוּ	1	These two verbs have very similar meanings and are often used together to express people’s physical and spiritual posture in worship. If such repetition would be misunderstood in your language, you may need to express the physical action and spiritual action explicitly. Alternate translation: “and bowed to the ground in worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
34:9	mh3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Here, **found favor** is an idiom that means that God is pleased with Moses. You may also need to make the phrase active in form and change the abstract noun **favor** into another form. Finally, **eyes** are a metonym for sight, and sight is a metaphor representing his evaluation. See how you dealt with the multiple issues in the phrase **I have found favor in your eyes** in [Exodus 33:12](../33/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
34:9	vhu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַם־קְשֵׁה־עֹ֨רֶף֙ ה֔וּא	1	Moses speaks of the people being rebellious as if they had **hard necks**. See how you translated this in [Exodus 32:9](../32/09.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
34:9	hw66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	לַ⁠עֲוֺנֵ֥⁠נוּ וּ⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתֵ֖⁠נוּ	1	The words **iniquity** and **sin** mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “all our sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
34:10	zwsm			your people	0	Starting in this verse, the covenant is largely repeated and consists of two parts: (1) what Yahweh will do, which is detailed in verses 10-11 (and briefly restated in verse 24) and (2) what is required of the Israelites, which is detailed in verses 12-26. For further context, see [Exodus 19:5 and following](../19/05.md), and [23:20-24:8](../23/20.md). Verses 12-26 are another list of ten commandments.
34:10	ps7o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כֹּרֵ֣ת בְּרִית֒	1	To **cut a covenant** means to make a covenant. The terminology refers to ancient rituals around making covenants, which is illustrated in Genesis 15. See the imagery and how you translated there. Alternate translation: “am about to make a covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
34:10	zdq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	עַמְּ⁠ךָ֙	1	Here, the **people** are referred to as belonging to Moses. This refers to his being their leader. Alternate translation: ”the people you lead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
34:10	itdx			כָל־הָ֠⁠עָם אֲשֶׁר־אַתָּ֨ה בְ⁠קִרְבּ֜⁠וֹ	1	This phrase is ambiguous and could refer to: (1) the nations that surrounded Israel or (2) the Israelites (who surrounded Moses). Attempt to maintain the ambiguity if you can; otherwise you may choose one, perhaps following another locally known translation’s choice.
34:10	bj1a			כִּֽי־נוֹרָ֣א ה֔וּא אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲנִ֖י עֹשֶׂ֥ה עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	This means that what Yahweh is doing causes people to be afraid. In this case, people will fear Yahweh when they see what he does. Alternate translation: “for what I am doing with you will cause fear”
34:10	s7uz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Here, **you** refers to Moses and the people of Israel. If your language makes a distinction, use a plural form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
34:11	xtkf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גֹרֵ֣שׁ מִ⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **from before your faces** means “ahead of you” or “on your behalf.” Yahweh is emphasizing who is doing the driving out. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

34:12	tnka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	לְ⁠יוֹשֵׁ֣ב & יִהְיֶ֥ה	1	# General Information:\n\nThe word **inhabitant** is a singular noun that refers to any individual inhabitant or group of inhabitants from the peoples mentioned in the previous verse. The pronoun **he** is agreeing with that singular noun. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “with the inhabitants of … they become” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
34:12	lxz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	פֶּן־יִהְיֶ֥ה לְ⁠מוֹקֵ֖שׁ בְּ⁠קִרְבֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	People who tempt others to sin are spoken of as if they were a **trap.** If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “lest those remaining people tempt you to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
34:13	wkbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כִּ֤י	1	This word marks a strong contrast with the previous verse. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a strong contrast.

You should use whatever form in your language would emphasize or focus on each item that they must destroy. Alternate translation, as separate sentences: “as for their altars, break them down! As for their stone pillars, smash them to pieces! As for their trees where they worship the goddess Asherah, cut them all down!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
34:13	gbp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	תִּכְרֹתֽוּ⁠ן	1	For some reason only this pronoun is singular, referring back the singular “inhabitant” in the previous verse.

34:14	fzjz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לֹ֥א תִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖ה	1	To **bow to another god** means to worship it. This imagery is throughout scripture and should be retained in translation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you shall not bow to worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

If his people worship other gods, he loses honor, because when his people do not honor him, other people also will not honor him. This is pictured in a metaphor of a jealous spouse who is concerned that his spouse be faithful to him. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. The UST makes this image explicit as a simile, which can be done occasionally but would probably be too long for repeated use in a translation. Alternate translation: “Yahweh jealously guards his reputation. He is a God jealous of his honor.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
34:14	s5sd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּ֤י יְהוָה֙ קַנָּ֣א שְׁמ֔⁠וֹ	1	Here, the word **name** represents God’s character. Alternate translation: “Yahweh is always jealous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

The pronouns **he** and **his** are agreeing with that singular noun. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. See how you translated this in [verse 12](../34/12.md). Alternate translation: “with the inhabitants of … and they invite … from their sacrifice” or “with the inhabitants of … and one of them invites … from his sacrifice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

Your language may have a specific way this sort of argument must be structured or phrased. One way to see this would be to repeat **lest** before every verb in verse 15-16. Alternate translation: “If you cut a covenant the inhabitant of the land, and if they then prostitute after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and if he then invites you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

It serves as a reminder of the command Yahweh is giving as he begins to expand on the “trap” he mentioned in verse 12. Your language may need to mark this repetition in a particular way. Alternate translation: “Remember: keep yourself lest you cut a covenant with the inhabitant of the land”
34:15	n4nt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תִּכְרֹ֥ת בְּרִ֖ית	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nSee how you translated this in [verse 12](../34/12.md). Alternate translation: “you make a covenant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
34:15	gtd8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠זָנ֣וּ׀ אַחֲרֵ֣י אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	In this metaphor, Yahweh speaks of people worshiping other gods as if they were prostitutes going to other men. This metaphor is most often used regarding the unfaithfulness of the Israelites. The metaphor is not quite as clear with the other nations because while Yahweh is the only true God, he is not in special covenant with the other nations as their god. However, since the worship is still impurely following false gods, the metaphor is used here. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. Alternate translation: “and they worship their gods” or “because they worship their gods like prostitutes who go to other men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
34:15	d1m0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠זָנ֣וּ׀ אַחֲרֵ֣י אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	This phrase may also be seen as a metonymy because sexual sin was a regular part of worshiping false gods. Alternate translation: “and they worship by fornicating with their gods’ cult prostitutes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
34:15	vijl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠קָרָ֣א לְ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, what the inhabitant will invite the Israelite to is not stated, but can be inferred from context. At the most basic level it is an invitation to eat food the Israelites were forbidden to eat. It is unclear how much more participation in worshiping false gods is implied. If your language requires that you specify what the Israelite is being invited into you may have to add some information. Alternate translation: “and he will invite you to eat from his sacrifice” or “and he will invite you to a feast to honor his gods” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
34:15	ygd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ מִ⁠זִּבְחֽ⁠וֹ	1	The first part of the sin Yahweh is warning against in this and the next verse is to **eat from his sacrifice**. This clause is the result of disobedience regarding the **covenant** and the logical conclusion of the series of hypothetical events Yahweh presents before this. Alternate translation: “as a result, you will eat from his sacrifice” or “then you will eat from his sacrifice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
34:15	hhbc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ מִ⁠זִּבְחֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **and you eat from his sacrifice** may represent any and all parts of the worship of the other nations’ false gods. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you feast to honor his gods” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
34:15	bj2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ מִ⁠זִּבְחֽ⁠וֹ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the consequence of eating food that is sacrificed to another god explicitly.

34:16	jaic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	you will eat some of his sacrifice	0	The string of hypothetical actions, each with its logical result continues throughout this verse.

34:16	d4ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠זָנ֣וּ בְנֹתָ֗י⁠ו אַחֲרֵי֙ אֱלֹ֣הֵי⁠הֶ֔ן	1	In this metaphor, Yahweh speaks of people worshiping other gods as if they were prostitutes going to other men. This metaphor is most often used regarding the unfaithfulness of the Israelites. The metaphor is not quite as clear with the other nations because while Yahweh is the only true God, he is not in special covenant with the other nations as their god. However, since the worship is still impurely following false gods, the metaphor is used here. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible.

The metaphor is clear here since it is referring to Israelite men who should be Yahweh worshipers. This is an important Biblical metaphor that should be kept in translation if at all possible. Alternate translation: “and cause your sons to worship their gods” or “and cause your sons to worship their gods like prostitutes who go to other men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Specifically it is the result of intermarriage with the pagans, which God has explicitly forbidden for this very reason. If your language marks the final consequence of a string of actions in a particular way it may be appropriate to use it here. Alternate translation: “and in the end, they will cause even your sons to prostitute after their gods” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

See how you translated **Aviv** in [Exodus 13:4](../13/04.md). You could convert the Hebrew day and month into an approximate date on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the date will be different every year and the translation will not be entirely accurate. So you may just want to give the number of the day and the name of the month on the Hebrew calendar, and say approximately what time of year that is on your calendar in a footnote.(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])

34:20	u2p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵרָא֥וּ פָנַ֖⁠י רֵיקָֽם	1	Here understatement is used to emphasize that the Israelites must bring a suitable offering to Yahweh. This portion of the verse is identical to the end of [Exodus 23:15](../23/15.md). If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement.

34:22	d13l			וְ⁠חַג֙ הָֽ⁠אָסִ֔יף	1	This festival celebrated the final harvesting of all the crops for the year. This festival was also known as the Festival of Shelters or the Festival of Booths. The idea came from the practice of the farmers living in temporary booths, or huts, out in the fields to guard the crop as it ripened. See Deuteronomy 16:13.

Starting in this chapter and even more so in chapter 36, the commands regarding the construction of the Dwelling complex are repeated, often word for word, from chapters 25-31. In many verses the only difference will be a change of verb form from instruction to completion. As much as possible, these parallels will be pointed out for the translators with links to the previous verses. Translators should refer back to the previously translated verses for consistency and because notes in this section may not cover everything that was covered in the initial instruction section.\n- Many items, materials, and processes for building the Dwelling may be unknown, but should have already been addressed in chapters 25-31.

The people of Israel did everything	0	This verse starts a short narrative of the Israelites bringing and presenting the items for the Dwelling to Moses for inspection. It is a summary of the construction and extended conclusion to the last few chapters. Your team may need to decide how to group verse 32, as it both closes the construction narrative and introduces this next section, which ends with a very similar summary statement in [verses 42-43](../39/42.md).

40:intro	fa6e				0	# Exodus 40 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- In this chapter, **just as Yahweh commanded Moses** is repeated seven times, as in the previous chapter, to show that Moses was obedient to every detail of Yahweh’s command.\n- This chapter is repetitive both internally and with other parts of the book. Verses 17-33 parallel verses 2-8 in an expanded way.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n- The **Dwelling** and **tent of meeting** are the same thing, but both appear next to each other many times in this chapter. The two interchangeable terms are brought together throughout this chapter in a poetic doubling to bring book to a close. If your readers would find this confusing, you may need to simplify to one or expand in explanation like in the UST.\n- This chapter says that Moses did all these things. Just like with Bezalel in earlier chapters, it would have been impossible for him to do all this personally. The people helped him set up the Dwelling. In many translations this will more clear if you make this explicit.\n- “the glory of Yahweh filled the Dwelling”: This phrase indicates that Yahweh began to dwell within the Dwelling, among Israel, in a special way. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])

40:2	gzk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	מִשְׁכַּ֖ן אֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵֽד	1	These refer to the same place. See how you translated the doubling in [39:32](../39/32.md). Alternate translation: “the Dwelling, that is the tent of meeting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
40:2	clkf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לַ⁠חֹ֑דֶשׁ	1	Here, the new or next year is omitted because it can be inferred from context. However, if that would be misunderstood by your readers (perhaps they would think it just meant ”next month” or something), you could add a phrase to make it clear that it is the first month of the year. This refers to exactly one year after God rescued his people from Egypt. See [Exodus 12:2](../12/02.md). Alternate translation: “month of the year” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

40:17	r6pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הוּקַ֖ם הַ⁠מִּשְׁכָּֽן	1	The use of the passive here indicates that the important thing is the completion of the task of setting up the tent on the specific date Yahweh had commanded.

40:38	bhi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּֽית־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	Here, **house** represents a people group, the Israelites, who were descended from Jacob, who was also named Israel. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use a metaphor from your language or translate the meaning. This is a common biblical metaphor, so you may want to check other places this occurs. The **house of Israel** is equivalent to “sons of Israel” or “Israelites.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
