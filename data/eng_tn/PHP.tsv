Final remarks\n    * Values (4:8–9)\n    * Contentment (4:10–20)\n    * Final Greetings (4:21–23)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Philippians?\n\nPaul wrote Philippians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome.\n\n### What is the book of Philippians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the believers in Philippi, a city in Macedonia. He wrote it to thank the Philippians for the gift they had sent him. He wanted to tell them how he was doing in prison and to encourage them to rejoice, even if they were suffering. He also wrote to them about a man named Epaphroditus, the one who brought the gift to Paul. While visiting Paul, Epaphroditus became ill, so Paul decided to send him back to Philippi. Paul encouraged the believers in Philippi to welcome him and to be kind to Epaphroditus when he returned.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philippians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Philippi,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Philippi.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the city of Philippi like?\n\nPhilip, the father of Alexander the Great, founded Philippi in the region of Macedonia. This meant that the citizens of Philippi were also considered citizens of Rome. The people of Philippi were proud of being citizens of Rome. But Paul tells the believers that it is much more important that they are citizens of heaven (3:20).\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The words “you” and “your” always refer to the believers in Philippi, except for one time in 4:3. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### Who were the “enemies of the cross of Christ” (3:18) in this letter?\n\nThe “enemies of the cross of Christ” were probably people who called themselves believers, but they did not obey God’s commands. They thought that freedom in Christ meant that believers could do whatever they desired, and God would not punish them (3:19).\n\n### Why were the words “joy” and “rejoice” frequently used in this letter?\n\nPaul was in prison when he wrote this letter (1:7). Even though he suffered, Paul said many times that he was joyful because God had been kind to him through Jesus Christ. He wanted to encourage his readers to have the same trust in Jesus Christ.\n\n### What does Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” or “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nThese kinds of expressions occur in 1:1, 8, 13, 14, 26, 27; 2:1, 5, 19, 24, 29; 3:1, 3, 9, 14; 4:1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 19, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Philippians?\n\nSome versions have “Amen” at the end of the final verse in the letter (4:23). The ULT, UST, and some modern versions include it, but many other versions do not. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
PHP	1	intro	kd3g	PHP_1_intro_kd3g		# Philippians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nPaul follows the normal practice of the time by beginning the letter with a statement of the names of the senders and the recipients. In that culture, the sender would then offer a good wish for the recipients. Paul does this in the form of a Christian blessing.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The day of Christ\n\nThis refers to the day when Christ returns. Paul often connected the return of Christ with motivating godly living. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This statement in verse 21 is a paradox: “to die is gain.” In verse 23 Paul explains why this is true. ([Philippians 1:21](../../php/01/21.md))

This includes gifts of money that they sent to Paul (See: [4:15–18](../04/15.md)). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this more explicitly. Alternate translation: “your participation with me in advancing the gospel” or “your partnership with me in working to spread the good news about Jesus”
PHP	1	5	vi1r	PHP_1_5_vi1r	ἀπὸ τῆς πρώτης ἡμέρας	The phrase **from the first day** refers to the time at which the Philippian believers first believed the gospel that Paul preached to them.

PHP	1	5	d8hi	PHP_1_5_d8hi	ἄχρι τοῦ νῦν	The phrase **until now** does not mean that the Philippian believers have now stopped partnering with Paul. Rather, it means that they are still partnering with Paul. Alternate translation: “that we are still sharing now”
PHP	1	6	s1l8	PHP_1_6_s1l8	πεποιθὼς αὐτὸ τοῦτο	The phrase **having been persuaded** indicates a reason that Paul thanks God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I thank God because I am confident of this very thing”

PHP	1	6	qhmh	PHP_1_6_qhmh	ὑμῖν	See how you translated the word **you** in [Philippians 1:2](../01/02.md).
PHP	1	6	p2a5	PHP_1_6_p2a5	ἐπιτελέσει	Here, **will perfect {it}** means that God would bring to completion the work which he began in the lives of the Philippian believers at their conversion and which he was continuing to do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this explicitly.
PHP	1	6	p5pu	PHP_1_6_p5pu	ἡμέρας Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	The phrase **the day of Jesus Christ** refers to the time in the future when Jesus Christ will return to judge the world and save those who believe in him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the time when Jesus Christ returns”
PHP	1	7	sowf	PHP_1_7_sowf	τὸ ἔχειν με ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμᾶς	The phrase, **I have you in my heart** is an idiom which expresses strong affection. If you have an equivalent expression which adequately communicates the meaning, you may use it here. If not, you could state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “I love you very much”
PHP	1	7	jn2s	PHP_1_7_jn2s	συνκοινωνούς μου τῆς χάριτος & ὄντας	Alternate translation: “sharing in grace with me”
PHP	1	7	df00	PHP_1_7_df00	χάριτος	Here, **grace** refers to the way that God kindly gives us good things that we do not deserve. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **grace** with a verb or adjective. In this context, Paul considers both his imprisonment and his ministry of defending and confirming the gospel to be gifts from God. Alternate translation: “of God’s gracious gift” or “in experiencing how kind God is”
PHP	1	7	o7ef	PHP_1_7_o7ef	δεσμοῖς μου	Paul refers to his imprisonment in Rome by using the phrase **my chains**. Paul was chained to a guard and the Philippian Christians would have understood that Paul was referring to his imprisonment when he used the phrase **my chains** because of the close association between **chains** and being in prison. If this association is not clear in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “my imprisonment”
PHP	1	7	wey7	PHP_1_7_wey7	καὶ ἐν τῇ ἀπολογίᾳ καὶ βεβαιώσει τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	The words translated **defense** and **confirmation** could be used to refer to defending and confirming in a court of law the truth of something against which a charge was made. These two words mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize that this is hard work. If your language has one word for these ideas, use that here and add emphasis another way. If there is a word or phrase that could be used with this legal sense but could also be used in the context of defending the gospel, consider using it here. Alternate translation: “and as I contend for the truth of the gospel” or “and as I labor to show people that the gospel is true”
PHP	1	8	xun1	PHP_1_8_xun1	ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	The Greek word translated as **inner parts** is a term which refers to body organs, particularly to the intestines, liver, lungs, and heart.

Alternate translation: “with the heart of Christ Jesus” or “with the affection of Christ Jesus”
PHP	1	8	bo0r	PHP_1_8_bo0r	ἐν σπλάγχνοις Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	Here, **the inner parts of Christ Jesus** could mean: (1) the same kind of love as Christ Jesus gives to people. (2) love that originates with Christ Jesus. Alternate translation: “with love that comes from Christ Jesus”
PHP	1	9	jlyu	PHP_1_9_jlyu	ἵνα ἡ ἀγάπη ὑμῶν ἔτι μᾶλλον καὶ μᾶλλον περισσεύῃ	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **love** with the verb form. Alternate translation: “that you will be able to love others more and more abundantly”
PHP	1	9	f4q5	PHP_1_9_f4q5	ὑμῶν	See how you translated the word **your** in [Philippians 1:5](../01/05.md).

PHP	1	10	e17g	PHP_1_10_e17g	εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν ὑμᾶς τὰ διαφέροντα	The word **{what}** here refers to that which a person does, and the word **excels** here refers to something that is best, according to God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that you may approve and choose to do what pleases God the most”
PHP	1	10	ybw6	PHP_1_10_ybw6	εἰς	Here, the phrase **so that** shows that what follows this phrase is the desired result of Paul’s prayer in verse nine. Consider using a connecting word or phrase that will clearly show that what follows it is the desired result of what Paul prayed in verse nine.
PHP	1	10	siv8	PHP_1_10_siv8	εἰλικρινεῖς καὶ ἀπρόσκοποι	The words **pure** and **blameless** have very similar meanings. Paul uses these two words together to emphasize the idea of moral purity. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these two words and translate them as one idea. Alternate translation: “completely innocent”
PHP	1	11	lu5n	PHP_1_11_lu5n	πεπληρωμένοι καρπὸν δικαιοσύνης τὸν	Here, the phrase **being filled with** is a metaphor meaning to be occupied in doing something. The phrase **the fruit of righteousness** is a metaphor which refers to what characterizes a person, namely what a person produces. This metaphor is a comparison between a good tree that produces good fruit and a person who is filled with righteousness and produces good actions as a result. So with these two metaphors, Paul is telling the Philippians to be occupied in doing righteous deeds. If this would be unclear in your language, you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “filling your lives with the righteous deeds that are” or “habitually doing the good works that are”
PHP	1	11	t3w4	PHP_1_11_t3w4	πεπληρωμένοι	The phrase **being filled with** is a passive form. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “letting God fill you with” or “continually producing”

Alternate translation: “that Christ Jesus produces in you” or “that Christ Jesus enables you to produce”
PHP	1	11	jwgb	PHP_1_11_jwgb	εἰς δόξαν καὶ ἔπαινον Θεοῦ	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **glory** and **praise** with verbs. Alternate translation: “which will cause people to glorify and praise God”
PHP	1	11	mfs6	PHP_1_11_mfs6	εἰς δόξαν καὶ ἔπαινον Θεοῦ	The words **glory** and **praise** mean very similar things here. They are used together to emphasize how much people will praise God. If you have one word for this in your language, you could use it here and show emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “which will cause people to greatly praise God” or “which will cause people to declare how great God is”
PHP	1	12	tu2t	PHP_1_12_tu2t	ἀδελφοί	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a spiritual sense to include both men and women who believe in Jesus. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters”
PHP	1	12	ygt3	PHP_1_12_ygt3	ἀδελφοί	Paul is using the term **brothers** here to refer to anyone who is a fellow believer in Jesus. If this is not clear in your language, you could express this plainly. Alternative translation, “my companions who believe in Jesus”
PHP	1	12	zy4g	PHP_1_12_zy4g	τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ	The phrase **the things concerning me** refers to Paul’s imprisonment. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the things I have suffered because I was put into prison for preaching about Jesus”
PHP	1	12	q288	PHP_1_12_q288	μᾶλλον εἰς προκοπὴν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου ἐλήλυθεν	The phrase **advancement of the gospel** refers to an increasing number of people hearing and believing the gospel. Alternate translation: “have actually caused more people to hear the gospel”
PHP	1	13	wi6n	PHP_1_13_wi6n	ὥστε	Here, the phrase **As a result** shows that what follows this phrase is the result of Paul’s circumstances which he began discussing in verse 12, namely, his imprisonment. Consider using a connecting word or phrase that will clearly show that what follows it is the result of Paul’s imprisonment.
PHP	1	13	h1ly	PHP_1_13_h1ly	δεσμούς μου	Paul again refers to his imprisonment in a figurative way by using the phrase **my chains**. See how you translated this phrase in [1:7](../01/07.md).
PHP	1	13	f8az	PHP_1_13_f8az	τοὺς δεσμούς μου & ἐν Χριστῷ	Here, the phrase **my chains in Christ** means that Paul is imprisoned because of his work for the cause of Christ. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “my chains for the sake of Christ” or “my chains because I teach people about Christ” or “my chains for the cause of Christ”
PHP	1	14	a1kh	PHP_1_14_a1kh	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	See how you translated **brothers** in the previous verse [1:12](../01/12.md).

Alternate translation: “trust the Lord more because of my chains” or “have received more courage from the Lord as a result of my imprisonment”
PHP	1	14	k4tm	PHP_1_14_k4tm	καὶ τοὺς πλείονας τῶν ἀδελφῶν ἐν Κυρίῳ πεποιθότας τοῖς δεσμοῖς μου	If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who or what caused the action. Alternate translation: “The Lord has encouraged most of the brothers because of my chains” or “My chains have given most of the brothers more trust in the Lord”
PHP	1	14	ecy8	PHP_1_14_ecy8	δεσμοῖς μου	Paul is referring to his imprisonment by mentioning one part of it: the chains that bound his feet and hands. If this is unclear in your language, you could mention the imprisonment directly. See how you translated the phrase **my chains** in [1:7](../01/07.md) and [1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: “because of my imprisonment”
PHP	1	14	v2wo	PHP_1_14_v2wo	τὸν λόγον	Here, **the word** refers to the message from God about Jesus. If it would be clearer in your language, consider stating this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the gospel” or “the good news” or “God’s message”
PHP	1	15	sa9n	PHP_1_15_sa9n	Some indeed even proclaim Christ	Beginning in this verse, and extending to the end of [1:17](../01/17.md), Paul uses a poetic device called chiasm that could be confusing in some languages. You may need to reorder certain things in [1:15–17](../01/15.md) if it would be more natural in your language. See the UST.
PHP	1	15	vw1s	PHP_1_15_vw1s	τινὲς μὲν καὶ & τὸν Χριστὸν κηρύσσουσιν	Alternate translation: “Some people are preaching the good news about Jesus”
PHP	1	15	z9y9	PHP_1_15_z9y9	διὰ φθόνον καὶ ἔριν	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **envy** and **strife** by using them in a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “because they are envious and seek their own evil purposes”
PHP	1	15	yh1c	PHP_1_15_yh1c	εὐδοκίαν	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **goodwill** by using it in a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “their desire that others would know Jesus Christ”
PHP	1	16	w0b8	PHP_1_16_w0b8	ἐξ ἀγάπης	Here the object of the word **love** is not specified. You can leave the object of **love** unspecified or, if it is needed in your language, you may specify the object of **love**. Here, the word **love** could refer to: (1) love for Paul. Alternate translation: “because of their love for me” (2) love for Christ. Alternate translation: “The ones who proclaim the good news because they love Christ” (3) love for multiple objects, such as Paul and Christ and those who have not yet heard or believed in the gospel. Alternate translation: “The ones who proclaim the good news because of their love for me, and Jesus, and those who do not believe”
PHP	1	16	ttr2	PHP_1_16_ttr2	κεῖμαι	You could state the phrase **I am appointed** in active form. Alternate translation: “God appointed me”
PHP	1	16	st7k	PHP_1_16_st7k	εἰς ἀπολογίαν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	Paul is speaking of the gospel as though it were a place or person that could be attacked.

You could also start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They hope to cause me trouble in my imprisonment by their preaching”
PHP	1	18	dc7l	PHP_1_18_dc7l	τί γάρ	The phrase **What then?** is a rhetorical question. If using a rhetorical question would be confusing in your language, consider expressing the meaning of this rhetorical question by changing it into a statement. Alternate translation: “But that does not matter!”
PHP	1	18	z5ia	PHP_1_18_z5ia	τί γάρ	In the rhetorical question **What then?**, Paul leaves out some words that might be necessary in some languages. If you want to use a rhetorical question here, you may want to add the words which are implied but not stated. This could be done in two ways: (1) as a rhetorical question which expects a negative answer. Alternate translation: “What does it matter what their motives are?” or “So what difference does it make?” (2) as a phrase that focuses on the result. Alternate translation: “What then is the result of this?”
PHP	1	18	sw24	PHP_1_18_sw24	Χριστὸς καταγγέλλεται	You can express the meaning of the passive form **is proclaimed** with an active form. Alternate translation: “we all proclaim Christ”
PHP	1	19	saze	PHP_1_19_saze	τοῦτό	Here, the word **this** refers to Paul’s current situation of being in prison and the things that accompanied it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “my imprisonment” or “my current condition in prison”
PHP	1	19	h9hf	PHP_1_19_h9hf	οἶδα γὰρ ὅτι τοῦτό μοι ἀποβήσεται εἰς σωτηρίαν	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning behind the abstract noun **deliverance** by using a verbal phrase. You could also say who does the action, if necessary. Alternate translation: “for I know that this will result in God delivering me”
PHP	1	19	zr2k	PHP_1_19_zr2k	ἐπιχορηγίας τοῦ Πνεύματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning behind the abstract noun **provision** by using a verbal phrase.

He says that if they live out what he has just told them, then when Christ returns, he can be proud of the fact that he did not work in vain among them. Consider the best way in your language to show this reason-result relationship. Alternate translation: “so that I will be able to boast on the day Christ returns that I did not run in vain or labor in vain”

Alternate translation: “I did not work so hard for nothing” or “I did not work hard with no lasting results”
PHP	2	16	m1z7	PHP_2_16_m1z7	οὐκ εἰς κενὸν ἔδραμον	Here Paul uses the word **run** metaphorically to mean “work.” Here Paul specifically means that he worked for the advancement of the gospel among the Philippians. Paul uses the word **run** to bring to the Philippians’ minds the image of a runner who is racing toward a finish line in order to win a prize.

Alternate translation: “or work hard for nothing, trying to help you believe in Christ and obey him”
PHP	2	17	p9km	PHP_2_17_p9km	ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ	**But even if** connects the idea of running and laboring for the advance of the gospel, which Paul discussed in [2:16](../02/16.md), with what he says in the rest of this verse. Consider how to translate this phrase in your language in a way that shows this connection.
PHP	2	17	j2ov	PHP_2_17_j2ov	σπένδομαι ἐπὶ τῇ θυσίᾳ καὶ λειτουργίᾳ τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν	The phrase **I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice** uses imagery from the Old Testament Jewish sacrificial system. A priest would sacrifice an animal on the altar as a burnt offering to God and then pour out wine as a drink offering to God, in order to make the sacrifice complete. See [Num 28:7](../num/28/07.md). If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, consider using it here, but if this imagery would be confusing in your culture, consider translating this imagery using plain language.

PHP	2	17	xlv0	PHP_2_17_xlv0	σπένδομαι	Paul uses the phrase **I am being poured out as an offering** to depict his imprisonment and suffering for the advancement of the gospel.

PHP	2	21	b922	PHP_2_21_b922	οἱ πάντες γὰρ τὰ ἑαυτῶν ζητοῦσιν, οὐ τὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	Here the words **they** and **their** refer to a group of people Paul does not think he can trust to help the believers in Philippi.

PHP	2	22	gm8i	PHP_2_22_gm8i	ὡς πατρὶ τέκνον, σὺν ἐμοὶ ἐδούλευσεν εἰς τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	The point of this comparison is that children learn from their fathers and try to follow and imitate them as they work alongside them. Paul was not Timothy’s biological father, but he uses this simile to illustrate how Timothy worked alongside him and learned from him as, together, they advanced the gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he learned from me and did what I did as he served with me in the gospel”

Alternate translation: “fellow believer who works and struggles along with us” or “fellow soldier of God” or “fellow warrior for God”
PHP	2	25	qsd6	PHP_2_25_qsd6	ὑμῶν & ἀπόστολον καὶ λειτουργὸν τῆς χρείας μου	Alternate translation: “who brings your messages to me and helps me in my need”

If this would be unclear in your language, consider clarifying this in your translation. Alternate translation: “For indeed Epaphroditus was sick nearly to death. But God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me, so that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow”
PHP	2	27	rl0m	PHP_2_27_rl0m	ἠσθένησεν παραπλήσιον θανάτῳ	If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **death** with an adjective such as “dying” or with a verbal form such as **died**, as the UST does. Alternate translation: “he was sick nearly to the point of dying”
PHP	2	27	n0zd	PHP_2_27_n0zd	ἀλλὰ ὁ Θεὸς ἠλέησεν αὐτόν	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **mercy**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **mercy** with an adjective such as “merciful” or in some other way. Alternate translation: “but God was merciful to him”
PHP	2	27	ioqq	PHP_2_27_ioqq	λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην	If it would be helpful in your language, consider using an equivalent expression for **sorrow upon sorrow**, or state the meaning of this phrase explicitly. Alternate translation: “sorrow added to sorrow”
PHP	2	27	dzgz	PHP_2_27_dzgz	λύπην ἐπὶ λύπην	The expression **sorrow upon sorrow** could mean: (1) adding the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death to the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ sickness. Alternate translation: “the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death added to the sorrow of his sickness” (2) adding the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death to the sorrow of Paul’s imprisonment. Alternate translation: “the sorrow of Epaphroditus’ death added to the sorrow of my imprisonment”

PHP	2	28	y5gc	PHP_2_28_y5gc	κἀγὼ ἀλυπότερος ὦ	Here when Paul refers to **pain**, he is referring to emotional pain. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **pain**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **pain** with an adjective such as “anxious” or “concerned” or in some other way. Alternate translation: “and I might be less anxious” or “and I might be less concerned about you”
PHP	2	29	y95x	PHP_2_29_y95x	προσδέχεσθε & αὐτὸν	The word **welcome** is a command or instruction in plural form to all of the Philippian Christians. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort all of you to welcome him” or “all of you receive him”
PHP	2	29	qx14	PHP_2_29_qx14	ἐν Κυρίῳ μετὰ πάσης χαρᾶς	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **joy** with an adverb such as “joyfully,” as the UST does, or you can use a verbal form of this word such as “rejoicing.” Alternate translation: “Therefore, welcome him in the Lord with rejoicing”
PHP	2	29	l59w	PHP_2_29_l59w	ἐντίμους ἔχετε	The phrase **hold in honor** is a command or instruction to all of the Philippian Christians. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to hold in honor” or “each of you honor” or “all of you honor”
PHP	2	29	lk2b	PHP_2_29_lk2b	ἐντίμους ἔχετε	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **honor**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **honor** with a verbal form of **honor** as the UST does, or in some other way.
PHP	2	30	ns1y	PHP_2_30_ns1y	ὅτι διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ μέχρι θανάτου ἤγγισεν, παραβολευσάμενος τῇ ψυχῇ, ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	Here, the pronouns **he** and **him** refer to Epaphroditus. If it would be helpful in your language, consider clarifying this in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “since for the sake of the work of Christ, Epaphroditus came near even to death, risking his life so that he might make up your lack of service to me”
PHP	2	30	vj8b	PHP_2_30_vj8b	διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ	In the phrase **the work of Christ**, Paul is using the possessive form to describe work that is done for Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this phrase in some other way. Alternate translation: “for the sake of working for Christ” or “as a result of working for Christ”
PHP	2	30	nhja	PHP_2_30_nhja	διὰ τὸ ἔργον Χριστοῦ	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **work**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **work** with a verbal form such as “working.” Alternate translation: “for the sake of working for Christ” or “as a result of working for Christ”

PHP	2	30	x4rl	PHP_2_30_x4rl	ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **service**, you can express the idea behind the word **service** by using a verb form such as “serve.” Alternate translation: “so that he might make up for your being unable to serve me”
PHP	2	30	g98z	PHP_2_30_g98z	ἵνα ἀναπληρώσῃ τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα, τῆς πρός με λειτουργίας	The **lack of service** Paul speaks of here is the inability of the Philippian believers to be present with him in prison. By sending Epaphroditus to Paul, the Philippian believers ministered to Paul’s needs through Epaphroditus, and so Epaphroditus supplied what they could not. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “so that he might supply what you could not give me” or “so that he might make up for what you could not give”
PHP	3	intro	btx3	PHP_3_intro_btx3		# Philippians 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn verses 4–8, Paul lists the ways he qualifies for being considered a righteous Jew. In every way, Paul was an exemplary Jew, but he contrasts this with the greatness of knowing Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Dogs\n\nThe people of the ancient Near East used dogs as an image to refer to people in a negative way. Not all cultures use the term “dogs” in this way.\n\n### Resurrected bodies\n\nWe know very little about what people will be like in heaven. Paul teaches here that Christians will have some kind of glorious body and will be free from sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Prize\n\nPaul uses an extended illustration to describe the Christian life. The goal of the Christian life is to grow to be like Christ while we live on earth. We can never achieve this goal perfectly, but we must strive for it.
PHP	3	1	zu9l	PHP_3_1_zu9l	ἀδελφοί	Paul is using the term **brothers** here to refer to anyone who is a fellow believer in Jesus. If this is not clear in your language, you could express this plainly. See how you translated this word in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md).
PHP	3	1	ymm2	PHP_3_1_ymm2	χαίρετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	The word **rejoice** is a command or instruction to all of the Philippian Christians. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to rejoice in the Lord” or “each of you rejoice in the Lord” or “all of you rejoice in the Lord”
PHP	3	1	b8y6	PHP_3_1_b8y6	ἐν Κυρίῳ	Alternate translation: “in your relationship with the Lord” or “in who the Lord is and what he has done”
PHP	3	1	qb78	PHP_3_1_qb78	ὑμῖν δὲ ἀσφαλές	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly how writing these things is a **safeguard** for the Philippians. Alternate translation: “and these teachings will protect you from those who teach what is false”
PHP	3	2	ttws	PHP_3_2_ttws	βλέπετε	All three times that the phrase **Beware** occurs in this verse, it is a command or instruction given to all of the Philippian believers. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “I exhort each of you to beware of” or “Each of you beware of”
PHP	3	2	ny6y	PHP_3_2_ny6y	βλέπετε	Alternate translation: “Watch out for” or “Look out for” or “Be on guard against”
PHP	3	2	zin8	PHP_3_2_zin8	τοὺς κύνας & τοὺς κακοὺς ἐργάτας & τὴν κατατομήν	The phrases **the dogs**, **the evil workers**, and **the mutilation** are three different ways of describing the same group of Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel. Paul uses strong expressions to convey his feelings about these Jewish teachers.
PHP	3	2	yeax	PHP_3_2_yeax	τοὺς κύνας	Paul speaks of the Jewish teachers who were corrupting the gospel as though they were **dogs** in order to show strong contempt for them. A dog is an animal that is common in many parts of the world. Dogs are despised in some cultures but not despised in other cultures, so using the term **dogs** in some cultures may not have the same derogatory or negative meaning that Paul intended. If you have a different animal in your culture that is despised or whose name is used as an insult, you could use this animal instead, if it would fit well in this context.
PHP	3	2	n44a	PHP_3_2_n44a	κακοὺς ἐργάτας	Here, the phrase **evil workers** refers to Jewish teachers who were teaching things that were contrary to the gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this phrase using plain language. Alternate translation: “false teachers”
PHP	3	2	vc2u	PHP_3_2_vc2u	τὴν κατατομήν	The word **mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to circumcision, and the phrase **the mutilation** is a sarcastic way of referring to the people who taught that circumcision was necessary in order to be in right standing with God. By using the term **mutilation**, Paul is showing the Philippian believers that those who trust in circumcision, and not solely in Christ, mistakenly think that they can earn God’s favor by cutting their bodies. Consider the term that would best communicate this idea in your language, or you could state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “those who cut themselves”
PHP	3	2	x8r2	PHP_3_2_x8r2	τὴν κατατομήν	Here, **the mutilation** refers to the Jewish teachers, all circumcised, who were corrupting the gospel by teaching that it was necessary to be circumcised.
PHP	3	3	y8yt	PHP_3_3_y8yt	ἡμεῖς γάρ ἐσμεν	Here Paul uses **we** to refer to himself and the Philippian believers and anyone else who believes in Christ, so **we** is inclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form.
PHP	3	3	xt5r	PHP_3_3_xt5r	ἡ περιτομή	In contrast to its normal usage in the Bible, here Paul uses the term **the circumcision** as a metonym to refer to all true Christians. Normally, the term **the circumcision** was used to refer to Jewish males, all circumcised, but here Paul intentionally uses this term with a spiritual sense to refer to all Christians, both Jews and non-Jew. This would have been surprising to his readers. Paul’s use of **the circumcision** here refers to the inward, spiritual circumcision that the Holy Spirit performs in the hearts of all true Christians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this term using plain language.
PHP	3	3	wn2n	PHP_3_3_wn2n	οἱ Πνεύματι Θεοῦ λατρεύοντες	Alternate translation: “the ones who are empowered by God’s Spirit to worship him” or “the ones who are enabled to worship God by his Spirit” or “the ones who worship God through his Spirit”
PHP	3	3	k8ph	PHP_3_3_k8ph	οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	You can state explicitly that Paul did not have any **confidence** in the “works of” **the flesh**. Alternate translation: “having no confidence in the works of the flesh” or “not trusting that circumcision will please God” or “not trusting that being circumcized will earn God’s favor”
PHP	3	3	nkrs	PHP_3_3_nkrs	καυχώμενοι ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	The phrase **boasting in Christ Jesus** and the phrase **and having no confidence in the flesh** are complementary ideas which express a similar truth. If people truly place their confidence in Christ as their only means of earning God’s favor, they will not put their confidence in themselves or religious acts. Conversely, if people put their confidence in religious rituals and observances, they cannot place their full confidence in Christ. Consider the best way to clearly express these coordinate ideas in your language.
PHP	3	3	ox7y	PHP_3_3_ox7y	καὶ οὐκ ἐν σαρκὶ πεποιθότες	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **confidence**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **confidence** with an adjective such as **trusting** or a verbal form such as **trust.** Alternate translation: “and we do not trust in our flesh”
PHP	3	4	upw5	PHP_3_4_upw5	ἐγὼ ἔχων πεποίθησιν καὶ ἐν σαρκί. εἴ τις δοκεῖ ἄλλος πεποιθέναι ἐν σαρκί, ἐγὼ μᾶλλον	Using a type of hypothetical situation, Paul recites his own credentials to illustrate that if observing the law could earn God’s favor, then he had more reason to boast than anyone else. His purpose is to teach the Philippian believers that they should only trust in Christ and not trust in other things to earn God’s favor. Paul explains in [3:7–11](../03/07.md) that his hope is in Christ and not in the things he lists in the next two verses. Alternate translation: “We do not trust in those rituals to make us acceptable to God, although I could very well do that if it would be useful for me”
PHP	3	5	d5bq	PHP_3_5_d5bq	περιτομῇ ὀκταήμερος ἐκ γένους Ἰσραήλ φυλῆς Βενιαμείν, Ἑβραῖος ἐξ Ἑβραίων, κατὰ νόμον Φαρισαῖος	In this verse and the next verse, Paul lists a total of seven things in which he put his confidence before he believed in Christ. In this verse he lists five of those things and in the next verse he lists the remaining two.
PHP	3	5	yq98	PHP_3_5_yq98	φυλῆς Βενιαμείν	The phrase **of the tribe of Benjamin** means that Paul was from the Israelite tribe of Benjamin and therefore descended from Jacob’s son Benjamin. Consider the best way to say this in your language.
PHP	3	5	p4ik	PHP_3_5_p4ik	Ἑβραῖος ἐξ Ἑβραίων	The phrase **a Hebrew of Hebrews** could mean: (1) that Paul had retained Hebrew customs and spoke the language of the Hebrew people, which was Aramaic. (2) that Paul had no Gentile ancestors, but rather was a pure-blooded Hebrew. Alternate translation: “a Hebrew whose parents and ancestors are all full-blooded Jews” (3) a combination of both of the above. Alternate translation: “a full-blooded Jew who has retained the Hebrew culture, customs, and language”
PHP	3	5	we4t	PHP_3_5_we4t	κατὰ νόμον Φαρισαῖος	The phrase **according to the law, a Pharisee** means that prior to his conversion Paul had been a Pharisee. He related to the law of Moses as a Pharisee and, therefore, strictly obeyed it as well as the many rules scribes had added to try to safeguard the law of Moses. Alternate translation: “in relation to the law of Moses, I was a Pharisee” or “in relation to how I observed the law of Moses, I was a Pharisee, and therefore, I strictly obeyed every detail of it including the teachings of the scribes”
PHP	3	6	f81s	PHP_3_6_f81s	κατὰ ζῆλος διώκων τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, κατὰ δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐν νόμῳ γενόμενος ἄμεμπτος	In this verse Paul finishes naming the things in which he put his confidence before he believed in Christ.
PHP	3	6	ksr3	PHP_3_6_ksr3	κατὰ ζῆλος διώκων τὴν ἐκκλησίαν	Here, the phrase **persecuting the church** is explaining the extent of Paul’s **zeal**. Before Paul believed in Jesus, he thought that by **persecuting the church**, he was serving God and ensuring that the law of Moses was honored and obeyed. If it would be helpful in your language, consider stating the meaning of the phrase **according to zeal, persecuting the church** plainly. Alternate translation: “having so much desire to serve God that I persecuted the church” or “wanting so much to honor God, I persecuted the church”
PHP	3	6	n51b	PHP_3_6_n51b	τὴν ἐκκλησίαν	Here, **church** is a collective noun. The phrase **the church** refers to Christians as a whole and includes anyone belonging to the group of people who follow Jesus. What Paul means by saying that he had persecuted **the church** is that he formerly persecuted anyone who was a Christian. Alternate translation: “persecuting Christians” or “persecuting anyone who was a Christian”
PHP	3	6	hln8	PHP_3_6_hln8	κατὰ δικαιοσύνην τὴν ἐν νόμῳ γενόμενος ἄμεμπτος	The phrase **righteousness {that is} in the law** refers to obeying the righteous guidelines for living that the law of Moses required. Paul obeyed the law so carefully that he believed that no one could find any part of it that he disobeyed. If it would be helpful in your language, consider stating it plainly. Alternate translation: “As regards obeying the law of Moses, no one could say that I ever disobeyed the law”
PHP	3	7	i2td	PHP_3_7_i2td	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη, ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	This entire verse is Paul’s response to the seven things he listed in [3:5–6](../03/05.md), which he once considered to be spiritually and religiously profitable to himself. In this verse Paul contrasts his former way of viewing things when he was a Pharisee with his new way of viewing things now that he believes in Christ.
PHP	3	7	lb8f	PHP_3_7_lb8f	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη, ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	In the original language in which Paul wrote this letter, the words **gains** and **loss** were common business terms used for accounting to describe things a business person determined to be either profitable or unprofitable. Here, Paul is using these two terms metaphorically to portray the things he considers spiritually profitable and unprofitable. If your language has similar business or accounting terms that would be natural to use in this context, consider using them here. Alternate translation: “Whatever things I formerly counted as gains, these things I now count as loss for the sake of Christ” or “Whatever things I formerly accounted as gains, these things I now account as loss for the sake of Christ”
PHP	3	7	n4lg	PHP_3_7_n4lg	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη	Here, the phrase **Whatever things were gains for me** refers specifically to the list of seven things that Paul has just listed in [3:5–6](../03/05.md) and to anything else in which he would have put confidence before he believed in Christ. Alternate translation: “Whatever things I formerly considered profitable”
PHP	3	7	nwdi	PHP_3_7_nwdi	ἅτινα ἦν μοι κέρδη	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **gains**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **gains** by using an adjective such as **profitable**, or you can express it in some other way. Alternate translation: “Whatever things were profitable for me”
PHP	3	7	yxtx	PHP_3_7_yxtx	ταῦτα ἥγημαι διὰ τὸν Χριστὸν ζημίαν	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **loss**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **loss** by using a verbal phrase such as “worth losing”. Alternate translation: “I consider these things worth losing for the sake of Christ”
PHP	3	8	e1fp	PHP_3_8_e1fp	ἀλλὰ μενοῦνγε καὶ ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι, διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου, δι’ ὃν τὰ πάντα ἐζημιώθην καὶ ἡγοῦμαι σκύβαλα, ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω	In this verse Paul continues the business metaphor which he began in [3:7](../03/07.md).
PHP	3	8	epts	PHP_3_8_epts	ἡγοῦμαι	See how you translated the word **consider** in [3:7](../03/07.md).
PHP	3	8	wugj	PHP_3_8_wugj	ζημίαν	See how you translated the abstract noun **loss** in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “worth losing”
PHP	3	8	iji5	PHP_3_8_iji5	καὶ ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι, διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **value**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **value** with an adjective such as “valuable.” Alternate translation: “I consider everything worth losing for the sake of what is most valuable, namely, knowing Christ Jesus my Lord”
PHP	3	8	dxql	PHP_3_8_dxql	διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **knowledge** with a verbal form such as “knowing.” Alternate translation: “because of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord”
PHP	3	8	cv55	PHP_3_8_cv55	διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	Alternate translation: “because knowing Christ Jesus my Lord is worth so much more”
PHP	3	8	g1hy	PHP_3_8_g1hy	τῆς γνώσεως Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου μου	Here, the word **knowledge** does not refer to simply being mentally aware of something or someone, but rather, it refers to having a deep, intimate, personal knowledge or experience of someone or something. Here, it refers to having an intimate and personal knowledge or experience of Christ. Consider the best way to express this meaning in your language. Alternate translation: “of intimately knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” or “of deeply knowing and experiencing Christ Jesus my Lord”
PHP	3	8	dh2d	PHP_3_8_dh2d	δι’ ὃν τὰ πάντα ἐζημιώθην	See how you translated the abstract noun **loss** earlier in this verse and in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “for whom I have willingly lost all things”
PHP	3	8	cez0	PHP_3_8_cez0	ἡγοῦμαι	See how you translated the word **consider** earlier in this verse and in [3:7](../03/07.md).
PHP	3	8	ovd9	PHP_3_8_ovd9	σκύβαλα	During Paul’s time the word **dung** was used to refer to excrement and things which were considered worthless and worthy of being thrown out. In the original language in which Paul wrote this letter, the term **dung** was a crude term that referred to things that were discarded as garbage, including dung, and the specific meaning was determined by context. Here, this word could be referring to: (1) excrement, since in the preceding verses Paul has been discussing what comes from the flesh. Alternate translation: “excrement” or “crap” (2) garbage, since Paul is discussing what he now considers worth throwing away in order to gain and know Christ. Alternate translation: “garbage” or “refuse”
PHP	3	8	vgf5	PHP_3_8_vgf5	κερδήσω	See how you translated the word **gains** in [3:7](../03/07.md).
PHP	3	8	h3kq	PHP_3_8_h3kq	ἵνα Χριστὸν κερδήσω	The phrase **so that** is a purpose clause. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose clauses. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of gaining Christ”
PHP	3	9	iy4k	PHP_3_9_iy4k	καὶ εὑρεθῶ ἐν αὐτῷ	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the passive verbal phrase **be found** with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “and God might find me belonging to him”
PHP	3	9	ubvr	PHP_3_9_ubvr	μὴ ἔχων ἐμὴν δικαιοσύνην, τὴν ἐκ νόμου	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **righteousness** in some other way. Alternate translation: “not being able to please God by keeping the law”
PHP	3	9	w62g	PHP_3_9_w62g	ἀλλὰ τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you can express the idea behind **faith** by using a verbal form. Alternate translation: “but that which comes by believing in Christ”
PHP	3	9	g9a9	PHP_3_9_g9a9	ἀλλὰ τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ	Here, the word **that** refers to “righteousness.” Paul assumes his readers will know this from the context. If this would be unclear in your language, consider stating this explicitly. Alternate translation: “but the righteousness which is through faith in Christ” or “but the righteousness which comes by faith in Christ”
PHP	3	9	pbgf	PHP_3_9_pbgf	τὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῇ πίστε	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you can express the idea behind the abstract noun **righteousness** in some other way. See how you translated **righteousness** earlier in this verse. Alternate translation: “being pleasing to God by believing in Christ”
PHP	3	9	jmqf	PHP_3_9_jmqf	τὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ δικαιοσύνην ἐπὶ τῇ πίστε	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you can express the idea behind **faith** by using a verbal form. See how you translated **faith** earlier in this verse. Alternate translation: “but the righteousness from God, which comes by believing in Christ”
PHP	3	9	dely	PHP_3_9_dely	ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει	In the phrase **by faith**, Paul is leaving out some words that would be needed to complete the sentence in many languages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “which comes by faith” or “which is received through faith”
PHP	3	10	ot4a	PHP_3_10_ot4a	τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν, καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ κοινωνίαν παθημάτων αὐτοῦ, συμμορφιζόμενος τῷ θανάτῳ αὐτοῦ	All occurrences of the pronouns **him** and **his** in this verse refer to Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify this in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to know Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death”
PHP	3	10	vj4s	PHP_3_10_vj4s	καὶ	The first occurrence of the word **and** indicates that what follows is the Paul’s explanation of how specifically he wants to know Christ.
PHP	3	10	tam1	PHP_3_10_tam1	τοῦ γνῶναι αὐτὸν, καὶ τὴν δύναμιν τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ, καὶ κοινωνίαν παθημάτων αὐτοῦ	In the original language in which Paul wrote this letter, he closely connects the phrase **the power of his resurrection** and the phrase **the fellowship of his sufferings**. He does this because in Paul’s mind these two things are inseparably linked, and a person cannot know the power of Christ’s resurrection without first sharing in Christ’s suffering.
