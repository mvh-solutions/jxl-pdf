It also tells how Jeremiah suffered in different ways while he prophesied.\n\nJeremiah began prophesying about 626 B.C. After the death of King Josiah, many groups of people in Israel opposed Jeremiah. Some of these people wanted to depend on Egypt to protect the nation. Others were idol worshipers. They hated Jeremiah for denouncing their gods. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\nDuring the reign of King Jehoiakim, Jeremiah prophesied about the temple of Yahweh. King Jehoiakim received some of these prophecies in writing and burned the document. The next king, Zedekiah, put Jeremiah in prison when he told the king to surrender to Babylon.\n\nKing Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia invaded Judah in 597 B.C. He conquered Jerusalem in 587 B.C. He offered Jeremiah housing and money if Jeremiah would go to Babylon. But Jeremiah remained in Jerusalem to help the few Jews left there.\n\nShortly after that, Gedaliah, whom Nebuchadnezzar had chosen to be governor over Judah, was murdered. Some Jewish rebels captured Jeremiah and took him to Egypt. Those rebels went to Egypt to be protected there rather than to live under Nebuchadnezzar’s rule. Jeremiah may have died soon after being taken to Egypt. But while in Egypt he prophesied that the Babylonians would invade and conquer Egypt.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe traditional title of this book is “The Book of Jeremiah” or just “Jeremiah.” Translators may also call it the “The Book about Jeremiah” or “What the Prophet Jeremiah Said.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Jeremiah?\n\nJeremiah was a priest and a prophet living in Judah. He spoke the prophesies in the Book of Jeremiah. A friend named Baruch wrote down many of the prophecies as Jeremiah spoke them to him.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is the new covenant that is presented in the Book of Jeremiah?\n\nJeremiah introduced a “new covenant” between Yahweh and Israel (chapter 31). Yahweh would “write this covenant on the hearts” of the people. This means that the covenant would be a part of the people instead of just written on stone or paper. The people would obey the new covenant with all their heart. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### What relationship do Jeremiah’s prophecies have to the other nations besides Israel?\n\nMuch of the Old Testament before this time is only about the nation of Israel. But Jeremiah also spoke of how Yahweh would judge other nations of the world. Yahweh would also punish the other nations for their wicked deeds. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Are the events in the Book of Jeremiah told in the order that they actually happened?\n\nMany of the events in the Book of Jeremiah are not told in the order that they actually happened. Instead, the various prophecies appear to be arranged by topic.\n\n### Why does the Book of Jeremiah refer to this prophet as “he” or “him”?\n\nMany times in the book, the author refers to Jeremiah as “Jeremiah” or “he.” This is unusual if Jeremiah wrote the book. The reason this occurs is perhaps because Baruch, Jeremiah’s secretary, wrote down some parts of the book. Translators should keep the words “Jeremiah” and “he.”
1:intro	e235				0	# Jeremiah 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:4-10.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Jeremiah appointed as prophet\n\nGod chose Jeremiah to be his prophet and although many powerful people would be against him, God promised to protect him. This chapter emphasizes that Jeremiah was chosen by God to be his prophet. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/appoint]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/elect]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])\n\n### Northern kingdom\nThis was not a reference to the northern kingdom of Israel; it had already been conquered. It was a reference to a kingdom located north of Judah, that is, to Babylon. The Babylonian armies would attack Judah and conquer it.\n\n### Opposition\nThe people were supposed to listen to God’s prophet. When he prophesied, they should have repented. Instead, they persecuted Jeremiah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])

3:intro	v6u2				0	# Jeremiah 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 3:1-5, 12-17, 19-25.\n\nThe prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 2:1-3:5. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. The same is true for 3:19-4:3. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Judah told to repent\n\nIf Judah repents, God will bring the people back from the captivity into which he is going to send them. In this book, “Israel” serves as another name Judah because the northern kingdom of Israel no longer exists. The people group formed by these ten tribes had been scattered among the other nations by the Assyrians, who had conquered them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n### Adultery\nJudah’s faithlessness to God is often pictured as adultery. This is a common image in Scripture.

9:intro	muj3				0	# Jeremiah 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 9:1-12, 17-24.\n\nThe prophecy revealed to Jeremiah is recorded in 8:5-9:12. Despite covering more than one chapter, this should be seen as one unit. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Funeral\nThis chapter pictures Jerusalem as having a funeral with its typical songs. This is an image used to describe their destruction. It is a time of great sadness.\n\n### Circumcision\nCircumcision is used here in an unusual way. Since circumcision was intended to be a display of faith, the author uses the term to differentiate between those who have faith in Yahweh and those who don’t. This is a type of metaphor. Those who have a circumcised heart have faith in Yahweh while those with an uncircumcised heart do not have faith in Yahweh, regardless of whether they are physically circumcised. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

15:intro	ebq4				0	# Jeremiah 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read.

31:intro	r3ad				0	# Jeremiah 31 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 31:1-6, 8-22, 35-37.\n\nThe ULT sets 31:29 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is an important quotation.\n\nThis chapter begins with a transition from the previous chapter. “At that time” is a reference to the day of restoration mentioned in [Jeremiah 30:24](../../jer/30/24.md). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The new covenant\n\nThis chapter is an important teaching regarding the new covenant. God will make a new covenant that will bring forgiveness of sins and a desire to obey God. Scholars disagree about whether this new covenant has begun. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Israel\nIn this chapter, Jeremiah uses the term “Israel” in reference to the nation of Israel as a whole. He also uses it in reference to the northern kingdom of Israel and their people group.

The ULT does this with the poetry in 51:1-64.\n\nThe prophesied destruction of Babylon continues in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n### Babylon destroyed\n\nBabylon will be conquered and the Jews will return to their homeland. At this time, Babylon controlled almost the entire Near East. The fulfillment of this prophecy would have been unthinkable. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])\n\n### Covenant with Abraham\nBabylon is destroyed because it drove the people of Judah from their homeland. This is in line with the promises of the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham to curse those who curse Abraham’s descendants.
