front:intro	c1uv				0	# Introduction to 1 Peter\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of 1 Peter\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n\n1. Peter reminds the believers of their identity in Christ (1:3–2:10)\n\n    * Praise to God for saving the believers (1:3–12)\n    * Command to be holy (1:13–21)\n    * Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n\n1. Peter tells the believers how they should behave (2:11–4:11)\n\n    * How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n    * How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n    * How believers should act because the end is near (4:7–11)\n\n1. Peter encourages the believers to persevere when suffering (4:12–5:11)\n\n    * How believers should respond to trials (4:12–19)\n    * How believers should interact with one another (5:1–11)\n\n1. Conclusion (5:12–14)\n\n### Who wrote the book of 1 Peter?\n\nThe author identified himself as Peter, who was also called Simon Peter. He was an apostle, and he also wrote the book of 2 Peter. Peter probably wrote this letter in Rome. He wrote the letter to Gentile Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/peter]])\n\n### What is the book of 1 Peter about?\n\nPeter wrote this letter to encourage Gentile Christians who were being persecuted and to exhort them to stand firm in “the true grace of God” ([5:12](../05/12.md)). Peter told his readers how they should act in the midst of a society that hated them. He encouraged Christians to continue obeying God even when they were suffering. He told them to do this because Jesus would return soon. Peter also instructed Christians about submitting to people in authority over them.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title “1 Peter” or “First Peter, ” or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter” or “The First Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How were Christians treated in Rome?\n\nPeter was probably in Rome when he wrote this letter. In [5:13](../05/13.md) Peter referred to Rome symbolically as “Babylon.” It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Romans were severely persecuting Christians.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Peter, except in two places: [1:16](../01/16.md) and [2:6](../02/06.md). The word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. Sometimes it refers to a specific group of people within Peter’s audience, such as wives, husbands, church leaders, or other groups. These groups are indicated in the notes. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of 1 Peter?\n\n“Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart” ([1:22](../01/22.md)). The ULT, UST, and most other modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, “Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth *through the Spirit* for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from the heart.” Translators are advised to follow the modern reading.\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	ql4i				0	# 1 Peter 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n2. Praise to God for saving the believers (1:3–12)\n3. Command to be holy (1:13–21)\n4. Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n\nPeter begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his name, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. That was the way people typically began letters at that time.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [1:24–25](../01/24.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### What God reveals\n\nWhen Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God’s people were because they had faith in Jesus. Then God’s people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.\n\n### Holiness\n\nGod wants his people to be holy because God is holy ([1:15](../01/15.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n### Eternity\n\nPeter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1:6](../01/06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are also glad because they know that God will save them “in the last time” ([1:5](../01/05.md))
1:1	g6b4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Πέτρος	1	In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Peter, am writing this letter” or “From Peter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:1	p0pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Πέτρος	1	**Peter** is the name of a man, a disciple of Jesus. See the information about him in Part 1 of the Introduction to 1 Peter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

1:1	owrg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις	1	In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then state to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:1	g3n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **elect** and **dispersion**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “to those whom God has elected and exiled among those whom God has dispersed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:1	u3zc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1	When Peter calls his readers **exiles**, he could mean: (1) they are **exiles** because they are far away from their true home in heaven. Alternate translation: “to the elect exiles of the dispersion who are far from their home in heaven” (2) they are **exiles** because they were forced to leave their homes and go far away to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles of the dispersion who are far away from your homes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:1	bg47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διασπορᾶς	1	Here, **dispersion** could refer to: (1) groups of Gentile Christians who were spread throughout the world instead of in their true home in heaven. In this case, **dispersion** would have a similar meaning to **exiles** and would add emphasis. Alternate translation: “among those dispersed outside of their true home in heaven” (2) the groups of Jewish people who were spread across the Greek-speaking world that was outside of the land of Israel, which is the common technical meaning for this word. Alternate translation: “among the dispersed Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:1	qkl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Πόντου, Γαλατίας, Καππαδοκίας, Ἀσίας, καὶ Βιθυνίας	1	**Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia** are names of Roman provinces that were located in what is now the country of Turkey. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:2	ba1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **foreknowledge**, you can express the same idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “what God the Father foreknew” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:2	lcps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1	This phrase could mean: (1) God had determined what would happen ahead of time. Alternate translation: “what God the Father planned previously” (2) God knew what would happen ahead of time. Alternate translation: “what God the Father knew beforehand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:2	z59t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρός	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:2	huw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἁγιασμῷ Πνεύματος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sanctification**, you can express the same idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “by the Spirit sanctifying you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:2	sfrr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐν ἁγιασμῷ Πνεύματος	1	Peter is using the possessive form to describe **sanctification** that is produced by the Holy **Spirit**.

1:2	j96u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ὑπακοὴν	1	Here, **for** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a purpose for which the Holy Spirit sanctifies believers. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of obedience” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:2	rwkk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ῥαντισμὸν αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Peter uses **sprinkling** figuratively to refer to believers being in a covenant relationship with God. Just as Moses sprinkled blood on the people of Israel in [Exodus 24:1–11](../exo/24/01.md) to symbolize that they were joining in a covenant relationship with God, believers are joined in a covenant relationship with God by means of Jesus’ death. Moses also sprinkled blood on the priests to set them apart to serve God as priests ([Leviticus 8:30](../lev/08/30.md)). If your readers would not understand this, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the covenant between believers and God established by the blood of Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:2	i9kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, **blood** refers figuratively to the death of Jesus. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “of the blood, the symbol of the death of Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:2	k547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1	In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Use a form in your language that makes it clear that this is a greeting and blessing. Alternate translation: “May God increase his kind acts to you and make you more peaceful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:2	iam1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **grace** and **peace** by stating the ideas behind them with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “May God multiply his kind acts to you and give you a more peaceful spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:2	z7df		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1	Peter speaks of **grace** and **peace** figuratively as if they were objects that could increase in size or number. If this is confusing in your language, you can use a different metaphor that means that these things will increase, or use plain language. Alternate translation: “May grace and peace increase in your lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:2	gj71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1:3	l4vi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	εὐλογητὸς	1	Peter is using a statement to give an exhortation. If this is confusing in your language, you can use a more natural form for exhortation. Alternate translation: “Let us bless” or “Let us praise” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
1:3	z6wk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατὴρ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:3	cyf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμᾶς	1	The words **our** and **us** are inclusive. They refer to Peter and those believers to whom he is writing. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

Alternate translation: “has caused us to be spiritually reborn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:3	cbxb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἀναγεννήσας ἡμᾶς εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν, δι’ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	The clause **into a living hope** is parallel to “into an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance” in the next verse. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of the phrases in this verse in order to show that parallel structure. Alternate translation: “who has caused us to be born again through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from dead ones into a living hope” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1:3	qe1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν	1	Here, **into** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a purpose for which God causes believers to be born again.

Alternate translation: “through Jesus Christ being resurrected from among dead ones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:4	v9jq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς κληρονομίαν ἄφθαρτον, καὶ ἀμίαντον, καὶ ἀμάραντον	1	Here, **into** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a second purpose for which God causes believers to be born again. This clause states what the “living hope” in the previous verse is. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of giving us an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:4	b2zy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς κληρονομίαν ἄφθαρτον, καὶ ἀμίαντον, καὶ ἀμάραντον	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **inheritance**, you can express the same idea with a verb.

Alternate translation: “which God has kept in heaven for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:5	r4es		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοὺς ἐν δυνάμει Θεοῦ φρουρουμένους	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1:5	xsp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν καιρῷ ἐσχάτῳ	1	Here, **the last time** refers to “the day of the Lord,” which is the time when Jesus returns to the world to judge everyone and vindicate those who believe in him.

1:6	dtvb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἄρτι, εἰ δέον λυπηθέντες	1	Peter is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Peter is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “if now it is necessary, and it is, to have been distressed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1:6	a2bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὀλίγον ἄρτι, εἰ δέον λυπηθέντες ἐν ποικίλοις πειρασμοῖς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

He also uses **fire** figuratively to refer to the hardships that test how well believers trust in Christ. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “the genuineness of your faith … but being tested by hardships the way fire tests gold” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:7	ct3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **genuineness** and **faith**, you can express the same ideas in another way.

1:7	g1oe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἵνα τὸ δοκίμιον ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως πολυτιμότερον χρυσίου τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου, διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου, εὑρεθῇ εἰς ἔπαινον, καὶ δόξαν, καὶ τιμὴν, ἐν ἀποκαλύψει Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “so that the genuineness of your faith might be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; that faith is more precious than the perishing gold, but being tested by fire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1:7	u63m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως πολυτιμότερον χρυσίου τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου, διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου	1	In this clause Peter means that **faith** is more valuable than **gold** because faith lasts forever but gold does not, even if it is refined by someone passing it through **fire**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “of your faith, which is more precious than gold because even gold that is tested by fire can perish, but your faith will not perish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:7	a6q4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὑρεθῇ εἰς ἔπαινον, καὶ δόξαν, καὶ τιμὴν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “it might result in praise and glory and honor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:7	lewt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἀποκαλύψει Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Peter assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to the future **revelation of Jesus Christ**, when Jesus returns to earth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the future revelation of Jesus Christ” or “when Jesus Christ reveals himself again in the future” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:7	bkr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀποκαλύψει Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **revelation**, you can express the same idea in another way.

1:8	eka3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	χαρᾷ ἀνεκλαλήτῳ καὶ δεδοξασμένῃ	1	Here, **inexpressible** and **filled with glory** mean basically the same thing.

Alternate translation: “with joy so great that words cannot describe it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:9	hw6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κομιζόμενοι & σωτηρίαν	1	Here Peter speaks figuratively of **salvation** as if it were an object that someone could receive.

1:10	yyz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐξεζήτησαν καὶ ἐξηραύνησαν	1	The phrases **searched** and **inquired carefully** mean basically the same thing.

1:11	w3n8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ & Πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ	1	Peter is using the possessive form to describe the Holy Spirit as being **the Spirit** that is associated with **Christ**.

1:11	hjq5			προμαρτυρόμενον	1	This could indicate: (1) the time when **the Spirit of Christ was revealing** information to the prophets.

1:13	bjg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	διὸ	1	**Therefore** here refers back to everything that Peter has written in [verses 1–12](../01/01.md).

Alternate translation: “gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, hope fully” (2) two actions that are means by which Peter wants his readers to obey the command to **hope fully**.

1:13	ut69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν φερομένην ὑμῖν χάριν	1	Here Peter speaks of **grace** as if it were an object that could be brought to people.

1:14	opvh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὡς τέκνα ὑπακοῆς	1	Here Peter uses **children** figuratively to refer to people who love and obey God. The relationship between God and those who love him is like the relationship between a father and his children.

1:14	n5wg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τέκνα ὑπακοῆς	1	Peter is using the possessive form to describe **children** who are characterized by **obedience**.

1:14	j2wo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ἀγνοίᾳ ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **ignorance**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when you were ignorant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

1:16	tt52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἅγιοι ἔσεσθε	1	Peter quotes God using a future statement to give a command. If this is confusing in your language, you can use a more natural form for a command. Alternate translation: “You must be holy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
1:16	s8kz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὅτι ἐγὼ ἅγιος	1	In this quotation from the Old Testament, **I** refers to God.

1:17	x0xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & ἐπικαλεῖσθε	1	Peter is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Peter is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement.

1:17	c53b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἀπροσωπολήμπτως κρίνοντα	1	This phrase refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “God, who judges impartially” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:17	s6gv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν τῆς παροικίας ὑμῶν χρόνον	1	Here Peter speaks of his readers as if they were people living in a foreign land far away from their homes. Like people living away from home, so are Christians living away from their home in heaven. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “during the time that you are living away from your true home” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:18	pcm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὐ φθαρτοῖς, ἀργυρίῳ ἢ χρυσίῳ, ἐλυτρώθητε ἐκ τῆς ματαίας ὑμῶν ἀναστροφῆς πατροπαραδότου	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases.

1:19	gk6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἀμνοῦ ἀμώμου καὶ ἀσπίλου	1	Peter compares Jesus’ blood to the blood of the lambs that the Jewish priests sacrificed to God because of the people’s sins. The point of this comparison is that Jesus died as a sacrifice so that God would forgive people’s sins. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “like that of the unblemished and spotless lambs that the Jewish priests sacrificed to God for sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:19	smu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἀμώμου καὶ ἀσπίλου	1	The words **unblemished** and **spotless** mean basically the same thing. Peter uses this repetition to emphasize that Christ was completely perfect and sinless.

Alternate translation: “completely perfect” or “with no imperfections at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:20	msw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	προεγνωσμένου	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God having foreknown him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:20	tnrv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προεγνωσμένου	1	This phrase could mean: (1) God had determined what Christ would do. Alternate translation: “having been planned previously” (2) God knew what Christ would do ahead of time. Alternate translation: “having been known beforehand,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:20	ky7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **foundation**, you can express the same idea in another way.

1:20	dkk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φανερωθέντος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God having revealed him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:20	pmf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φανερωθέντος	1	Here, **having been revealed** refers to the first time Jesus came to the earth.

1:21	lt5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸν ἐγείραντα αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Here, to **raise him** is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again.

Alternate translation: “who caused him to live again so that he was no longer among the dead people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:21	f7mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δόξαν αὐτῷ δόντα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “has glorified him” or “has shown that he is glorious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:21	k85r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν καὶ ἐλπίδα, εἶναι εἰς Θεόν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **faith** and **hope**, you can express the same ideas in another way.

1:22	hj14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν ἡγνικότες	1	**Having purified** figuratively refers to being forgiven for sins. In the Bible, sin is often referred to as something that makes people dirty, and the forgiveness for sin is referred to as the removal of that dirt. God is the one who forgives sins and **purifies** those who believe in Jesus. However, here Peter is referring to his readers’ responsibility in their salvation, which is the responsibility to repent and believe that the gospel is true. Alternate translation: “Having made your souls spiritually pure” or “Having cleansed your souls from sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:22	luj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὰς ψυχὰς	1	See how you translated **souls** in [verse 9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

1:22	iyze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Here, **the truth** refers to the true teaching about Jesus, which includes the command to repent and believe the gospel. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “to the true message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:22	j777		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	φιλαδελφίαν	1	Although **brotherly** is a masculine word, Peter is using the phrase **brotherly love** in a generic sense to refer to the kind of love that all believers should have for other believers. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “love for fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:22	e9wr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας, ἀλλήλους ἀγαπήσατε ἐκτενῶς	1	Peter uses **heart** here figuratively to refer to a person’s thoughts or emotions. The word **from** indicates that the **heart** must be the source of the **love** that Peter is telling his readers to have. Therefore, this phrase has a similar meaning to the word “sincere” in the previous clause. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “love one another earnestly based on sincere thoughts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:23	k79f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀναγεγεννημένοι	1	See how you translated **born again** in [verse 3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:23	w4v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐκ σπορᾶς φθαρτῆς	1	The word **seed** usually refers to either the seed of a plant or the sperm cell of a man, which is used to produce a baby. However, here Peter uses **seed** as a metaphor. It could refer to: (1) the **word of God** mentioned later in the verse. In this case, Peter is saying what the **word of God** is not. Alternate translation: “not by means of a human message that can perish” (2) physical human birth, in which case the meaning is similar to the idea expressed in [John 1:13](../jhn/01/13.md). Alternate translation: “not by means of mortal physical birth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:23	nh9r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀφθάρτου	1	Peter is leaving out a word that a phrase would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “from imperishable seed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:23	tjq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγου ζῶντος Θεοῦ, καὶ μένοντος	1	Here Peter uses **word** figuratively to describe the gospel message that came from God and was proclaimed to Peter’s readers by using words. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s living and enduring message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:23	pkpl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ζῶντος & καὶ μένοντος	1	Here, **living** and **enduring** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that God’s word is permanent. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “perpetually enduring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:24	kyc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	διότι	1	**For** here introduces a quotation of some phrases from an Old Testament book ([Isaiah 40:6–8](../isa/40/06.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Peter is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “It is as Isaiah wrote in the scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
1:24	e299		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	πᾶσα σὰρξ ὡς χόρτος, καὶ πᾶσα δόξα αὐτῆς ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου. ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος, καὶ τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσεν,	1	In these clauses and the first clause of the next verse, Peter quotes parts of [Isaiah 40:6–8](../isa/40/06.md).

1:24	dr75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πᾶσα σὰρξ	1	Here Peter quotes Isaiah using the term **flesh** figuratively to refer to human beings in general, which are made of flesh. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “All humankind” or “Everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:24	zaa4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πᾶσα δόξα αὐτῆς	1	Peter quotes Isaiah using **glory** figuratively to refer to whatever is beautiful or magnificent about humankind.

If this would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase. Alternate translation: “flowers of grass. Grass dried up, and flowers fell off” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1:24	w0s8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἄνθος χόρτου	1	Here Peter quotes Isaiah using the possessive form to describe the **flower** that grows in the **grass**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the flower that grows in the grass” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:24	r0fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος	1	In this clause the prophet Isaiah continues the comparison between humankind and **grass**. Just like **grass** dies quickly, so human beings only live a short time. If this would confuse your readers, you could express this meaning by repeating the simile language from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “Like the grass dries up, so do people die after a short time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:24	hd2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσεν	1	In this clause the prophet Isaiah continues the comparison between the glory of humankind and flowers. Just like a **flower** dies and falls to the ground, so does the beauty of mankind disappear. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this meaning by repeating the simile language from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “like the flower that fell off the plant, so does everything that is glorious about humankind come to an end” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1:25	lqjz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τὸ δὲ ῥῆμα Κυρίου μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα	1	This clause completes Peters quotation of [Isaiah 40:6–8](../isa/40/06.md) that began in the previous verse.

1:25	aba2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ & ῥῆμα Κυρίου	1	Peter quotes Isaiah using **word** figuratively to describe all that God has spoken by using words.

1:25	s11j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ εὐαγγελισθὲν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:intro	a121				0	# 1 Peter 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n2. How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 2:10 and the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:6, 7, 8, and 22.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Stones\n\nThe Bible uses a building made of large stones as a metaphor for the church. Jesus is the cornerstone, which is the most important stone. According to [Ephesians 2:20](../eph/02/20.md), the apostles and prophets are the foundation, which is the part of the building on which all the other stones rest. In this chapter, Christians are the stones that make up the walls of the building. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/cornerstone]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/foundation]])\n\n### Milk and babies\n\nWhen Peter tells his readers to “long for pure spiritual milk” in [2:2](../02/02.md), he is using the metaphor of a baby craving his mother’s milk. Peter wants Christians to crave God’s word the same way a baby craves milk. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Sheep and shepherds\n\nThe Bible often speaks metaphorically of people as sheep because sheep do not see well, do not think well, often walk away from those who care for them, and cannot defend themselves when other animals attack them. In [verse 25](../02/25.md), Peter alludes to [Isaiah 53:6](../isa/53/06.md) to describe unbelievers as sheep that wander aimlessly and don’t know where they are going. God’s people are also similar to sheep in that they are weak and do foolish things like rebelling against God. In [verse 25](../02/25.md), Peter also refers to Jesus as a shepherd who takes care of believers, which is a similar idea to what Jesus said in [John 10:11–18](../jhn/10/11.md). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/sheep]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/shepherd]])
2:1	n3x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	**Therefore** here refers back to everything that Peter has said in the previous paragraph ([1:22–25](../01/22.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

If this is confusing in your language, you can use a more natural form for a command. Alternate translation: “put aside all evil and all deceit and hypocrisies and envies and all slanders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
2:1	g65y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀποθέμενοι & πᾶσαν κακίαν, καὶ πάντα δόλον, καὶ ὑποκρίσεις, καὶ φθόνους, καὶ πάσας καταλαλιάς	1	Peter speaks of these sinful actions figuratively as if they were objects that people could **put aside** the way people remove dirty clothing. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having stopped being evil or being deceptive or being hypocritical or being envious or speaking slander” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:1	r853		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀποθέμενοι & πᾶσαν κακίαν, καὶ πάντα δόλον, καὶ ὑποκρίσεις, καὶ φθόνους, καὶ πάσας καταλαλιάς	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **evil**, **deceit**, **hypocrisies**, **envies**, or **slanders**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “having put aside every kind of evil and all deceitful, hypocritical, deceptive, and slanderous acts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	y6fv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἀρτιγέννητα βρέφη τὸ λογικὸν ἄδολον γάλα ἐπιποθήσατε	1	The point of this comparison is that Peter wanted his readers to desire knowledge of God’s word just as **newborn babies** desire milk. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Just as babies long for their mother’s milk, so you must long for the pure rational milk” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:2	rm71			ἐπιποθήσατε	1	Alternate translation: “desire intensely” or “yearn for”
2:2	fn81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ λογικὸν ἄδολον γάλα	1	The word translated as **rational** could also be translated “pertaining to the word”; it refers to the word of God. Peter speaks figuratively of the word of God as if it were **rational milk** that nourishes children. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s pure word” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:2	ypy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐξηθῆτε	1	Peter speaks figuratively of believers advancing in the knowledge of God and faithfulness to him as if they were children growing up. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you may mature in your faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:2	vg76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς σωτηρίαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “until you are saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	wmw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς σωτηρίαν	1	Here, **salvation** refers to when Jesus returns and God completes the **salvation** of his people. Peter also uses this meaning for **salvation** in [1:5](../01/05.md). See how you translated **salvation** there. Alternate translation: “until God saves you completely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:3	uja9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἐγεύσασθε	1	Peter is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Peter is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since you have tasted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2:3	tui9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰ ἐγεύσασθε	1	Peter uses **tasted** figuratively to refer to personally experiencing something. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if you have experienced” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:3	hruw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ἐγεύσασθε ὅτι χρηστὸς ὁ Κύριος	1	This clause is a paraphrase of [Psalm 34:8](../psa/34/08.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:4	n5pm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς ὃν προσερχόμενοι	1	Here, **coming** could indicate: (1) a factual statement, as in the UST. (2) a command, in which case “being built up” in the next verse would also be a command. Alternate translation: “Come to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	apbp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πρὸς ὃν	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus, who is called “Lord” in the previous verse. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “to Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:4	c4lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸς ὃν προσερχόμενοι λίθον ζῶντα	1	Peter refers to Jesus figuratively as if he were a **stone** in a building. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or with a simile. Alternate translation: “coming to him, who is like a living stone in a building” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:4	ihq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	λίθον ζῶντα	1	Peters speaks of a **stone** figuratively as if it were **living**. This could refer to: (1) a stone that is alive. This interpretation emphasizes the fact that Jesus is alive even though he had died. Alternate translation: “a stone that lives” (2) a stone that gives life. This interpretation emphasizes the fact that Jesus gives eternal life to everyone who believes in him. Alternate translation: “a stone that gives eternal life to others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
2:4	e8sy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑπὸ ἀνθρώπων μὲν ἀποδεδοκιμασμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “one that men have rejected” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:4	euuz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ὑπὸ ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Peter is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “by people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:4	a438		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παρὰ δὲ Θεῷ ἐκλεκτὸν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:5	z11h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτοὶ ὡς λίθοι ζῶντες οἰκοδομεῖσθε, οἶκος πνευματικὸς	1	Peter uses **stones** figuratively to refer to his readers, people who believe in Jesus. Just as people in the Old Testament used **stones** to build the temple that God dwelled in, God is using believers to bring together a group of people in whom he will dwell. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you, like stones that are put together and built into a house, are living stones that are being brought together into a spiritual community in which God dwells” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	g33x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	αὐτοὶ ὡς λίθοι ζῶντες	1	Peters uses **stones** figuratively as if they were **living**. This emphasizes the fact that Peter’s readers have eternal life because they believe in Jesus. In this verse, **living** cannot mean to give life, because only God can give life. Alternate translation: “like stones that live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:5	v3jw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἰκοδομεῖσθε, οἶκος πνευματικὸς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Just as the priests in the Old Testament offered sacrifices to God, so should believers do good deeds and worship God.

Alternate translation: “like the holy priesthood that offered sacrifices to God, so you are made into a group which does good spiritual deeds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	ekkp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	εἰς ἱεράτευμα ἅγιον	1	The word **priesthood** is a singular noun that refers to a group of priests.

Alternate translation: “a group of holy priests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
2:5	zf45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πνευματικὰς θυσίας εὐπροσδέκτους	1	This could mean: (1) the **sacrifices** are of a spiritual, rather than physical, nature. Alternate translation: “the sacrifices of a spiritual nature that are acceptable” (2) the **sacrifices** are offered by the power of the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the sacrifices offered by the power of the Holy Spirit, which are acceptable” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:6	ibi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	περιέχει ἐν Γραφῇ	1	Here the quotation of **scripture** that occurs next in the verse is spoken of as if it were a person who **stands**.

2:6	wdwx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ἰδοὺ, τίθημι ἐν Σιὼν λίθον, ἀκρογωνιαῖον ἐκλεκτὸν ἔντιμον; καὶ ὁ πιστεύων ἐπ’ αὐτῷ, οὐ μὴ καταισχυνθῇ.	1	This sentence is a quotation from [Isaiah 28:16](../isa/28/16.md).

2:6	lrxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The phrase **certainly not** translates two negative words in Greek. God uses them together to emphasize the truth of this statement.

2:7	uu3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λίθος ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες	1	The author uses **stone** figuratively to refer to the Messiah, and he uses **builders** figuratively to refer to those who **rejected** Jesus. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “The Messiah who was rejected just like builders reject a stone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	ql12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	This phrase has the same meaning as “cornerstone” in the previous verse. It refers to the most important stone in a building.

Alternate translation: “the Messiah, who is like a cornerstone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:8	k0dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καὶ	1	Here, **and** introduces a quotation of an Old Testament book ([Isaiah 8:14](../isa/08/14.md)).

Alternate translation: “and Isaiah wrote in the scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
2:8	vxhb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	λίθος προσκόμματος, καὶ πέτρα σκανδάλου	1	This sentence is a quotation from [Isaiah 8:14](../isa/08/14.md).

Alternative translation: “He is like a stone of stumbling and like a rock of offense” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:8	ydkr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	λίθος προσκόμματος, καὶ πέτρα σκανδάλου	1	Peter quotes Isaiah using the possessive form twice in this sentence to describe a **stone** that causes **stumbling** and a **rock** that causes **offense**.

2:8	ptx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	λίθος προσκόμματος, καὶ πέτρα σκανδάλου	1	These two phrases mean almost the same thing. Isaiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that people will be offended by this **stone**. If stating the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “a stone or a rock over which people will surely stumble” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

3:intro	cqf4				0	# 1 Peter 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n2. How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [verses 10–12](../03/10.md).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “the spirits in prison”\n\n[Verse 19](../03/19.md) states that Jesus went and proclaimed to “the spirits in prison,” but does not mention what Jesus proclaimed or who those spirits are. [Verse 20](../03/20.md) states that these spirits disobeyed God during the time of Noah. Many scholars think that this means one of the following three meanings, each of which will be discussed in the notes for verses [19](../03/19.md) and [20](../03/20.md): (1) The spirits are demons who were imprisoned by God because they did something evil during Noah’s time (see [2 Peter 2:4–5](../2pe/02/04.md); [Jude 6–7](../jud/01/06.md); [Genesis 6:1–4](../gen/06/01.md)). [Verse 19](../03/19.md) then means that Jesus went to the place where they are imprisoned and proclaimed his victory to them at some time between his death on the cross and his return to heaven. (2) The spirits are sinful human beings who died during the flood in Noah’s time, and the prison is the realm of the dead. [Verse 19](../03/19.md) then means that Jesus went to hell and proclaimed his victory to those dead people there at some time between his death and resurrection. (3) The spirits are sinful human beings who died during the flood in Noah’s time, but [verse 19](../03/19.md) refers to the pre-incarnate form of Jesus indirectly preaching the gospel to them through the preaching of Noah.\n\n### “Baptism now saves you”\n\nIn [verse 20](../03/20.md) Peter refers to the story of God rescuing Noah and his family from the flood “through water.” Then in [verse 21](../03/21.md) he states that the water is an “antitype” for baptism, which is a Christian ritual by which a person publicly identifies as a Christian. Then Peter makes the statement that baptism “now saves you.” Since the New Testament authors repeatedly state that God alone saves people and that no one can do any work to be saved, Peter’s statement cannot mean that a person can be saved by being baptized. Rather, Peter uses the word “baptism” figuratively to refer to the faith in Jesus that a person publicly confesses when that person is baptized. Peter indicates later in [verse 21](../03/21.md) that he is not referring to water baptism, which he describes as “the removal of dirt from the flesh.” Peter further states that the baptism he is referring to saves “through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,” which means that a person is saved by faith in Jesus, because Jesus rose from the dead.

3:16	wrk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἵνα ἐν ᾧ καταλαλεῖσθε, καταισχυνθῶσιν, οἱ ἐπηρεάζοντες ὑμῶν τὴν ἀγαθὴν ἐν Χριστῷ ἀναστροφήν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “so that the ones who are reviling your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed about why you are being slandered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:16	s7mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταλαλεῖσθε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “people are slandering you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:16	qflw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμῶν τὴν ἀγαθὴν ἐν Χριστῷ ἀναστροφήν	1	Here, **in Christ** refers to being a Christian. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “your good behavior as a Christian” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:16	dvwr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταισχυνθῶσιν, οἱ ἐπηρεάζοντες ὑμῶν τὴν ἀγαθὴν ἐν Χριστῷ ἀναστροφήν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God may shame the ones who are reviling your good behavior in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:17	bt09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀγαθοποιοῦντας & κακοποιοῦντας	1	These two phrases indicate two different reasons for suffering. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because of doing good … because of doing evil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:17	x8qu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰ θέλοι τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Peter uses **the will of God** figuratively to refer to God himself. If your readers would not understand this, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if God wills” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:18	me4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν	1	Here, **sins** implies the **sins** of people other than Jesus, because Jesus never sinned. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the sake of the sins of others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:18	q9fa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	θανατωθεὶς & σαρκὶ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “people having killed him in the flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:18	j5lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	θανατωθεὶς & σαρκὶ	1	Here, **flesh** refers to Christ’s body, which was made of **flesh**. Peter is saying that the body of Christ was killed. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having been killed physically” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:18	h6v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ζῳοποιηθεὶς & πνεύματι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God’s spirit having made him alive” or “God having made him alive in the spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:18	n7nh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζῳοποιηθεὶς & πνεύματι	1	Here, **the spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, in which case this phrase would indicate the means by which Jesus was made alive. Alternate translation: “having been made him alive by the Spirit” (2) Jesus’ spiritual existence, in which case this phrase would be referring to the spiritual realm that is in contrast to the physical realm referred to with the phrase “in the flesh.” Alternate translation: “having been made alive spiritually” or “having been made alive in the spiritual realm” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:19	hp82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ᾧ	1	Here, **which** refers to “the spirit” in the previous verse. As in the previous verse, this could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “by means of the Spirit” (2) Jesus’ spiritual existence. Alternate translation: “in the spiritual realm” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:19	ewuu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐκήρυξεν	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. This phrase could mean: (1) Jesus proclaimed God’s victory over sin and death, which he accomplished through his death and resurrection. Alternate translation: “he proclaimed God’s victory” (2) Jesus preached the gospel to wicked people indirectly through the preaching of Noah during the time before the great flood. This interpretation is less likely to be correct, because it would mean that Noah was actually the one preaching and Peter does not mention Noah preaching or Jesus’ pre-incarnate existence anywhere in this letter. Alternate translation: “he preached the gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:19	ez3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς ἐν φυλακῇ πνεύμασιν	1	Here, **spirits** could refer to: (1) evil spirits whom God imprisoned because of what they did before the flood that occurred in Noah’s time (see [2 Peter 2:4–5](../2pe/02/04.md); [Jude 6–7](../jud/01/06.md); [Genesis 6:1–4](../gen/06/01.md)), as in the UST. (2) the spirits of people who died during the flood that occurred in Noah’s time. This interpretation is a less likely to be correct because Peter never refers to people as **spirits**, but rather “souls,” as in the next verse. Alternate translation: “to those people who had died and were in prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:19	zpyr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν φυλακῇ	1	Here Peter uses **prison** as a metaphor. It could refer to: (1) a place where God imprisoned certain evil spirits whom he will judge when he judges the whole world (see [2 Peter 2:4–5](../2pe/02/04.md); [Jude 6–7](../jud/01/06.md)). Alternate translation: “whom God had imprisoned to await judgment” (2) the place where sinful people go when they die. Alternate translation: “in hell” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:20	qxah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀπειθήσασίν	1	Peter is leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the context. Alternate translation: “having disobeyed God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:20	s7qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ τοῦ Θεοῦ μακροθυμία	1	Peter uses **patience of God** figuratively to refer to God himself. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “God himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:20	yyth		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ἡμέραις Νῶε	1	Here Peter uses **days of Noah** figuratively to refer to the time period when Noah was alive. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the time of Noah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:20	c6mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κατασκευαζομένης κιβωτοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when Noah was constructing an ark” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:21	dqjy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃ	1	Here, **which** refers back to the “water” mentioned at the end of the last verse. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:21	vxoh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ὃ καὶ ὑμᾶς ἀντίτυπον νῦν σῴζει βάπτισμα	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “which, being an antitype for baptism, now saves you also” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:21	tz6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ καὶ ὑμᾶς ἀντίτυπον νῦν σῴζει βάπτισμα	1	Here, **antitype** refers to one thing that is an analogy for another thing. In this context the “water” from the previous verse is an analogy for baptism. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “which is a symbol for baptism, now saves you also” or “which is analogous to baptism, now saves you also” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:21	ium3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βάπτισμα	1	Here Peter uses **baptism** figuratively to refer to the faith in Jesus that believers profess when they are baptized. The Bible clearly states that God saves people by grace through faith, not by any work like baptism ([Ephesians 2:8–9](../eph/02/08.md)). See the discussion in the General Notes for this chapter. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the faith in Jesus demonstrated by baptism” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:21	owi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐ σαρκὸς ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου, ἀλλὰ συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς, ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θεόν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **removal** and **appeal**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “it does not remove dirt from the flesh, but appeals to God for a good conscience” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:21	hmp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σαρκὸς	1	Here, Peter uses **flesh** figuratively to refer to a person’s physical body that is made of **flesh**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:21	uz0u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς, ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θεόν	1	Here the phrase **a good conscience** means Peter’s readers do not feel guilty because they know that God has forgiven their sins. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “an appeal to God to know that your sins have been forgiven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:21	jti3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καὶ ὑμᾶς & νῦν σῴζει βάπτισμα, οὐ σαρκὸς ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου, ἀλλὰ συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς, ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θεόν δι’ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ,	1	Here, **through the resurrection of Jesus Christ** indicates the means by which the faith demonstrated by baptism saves. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases to make that meaning clear. Alternate translation: “baptism now saves you also through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is not a removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:21	rixf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δι’ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **resurrection**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “through God raising Jesus Christ from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:22	p5ij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ὅς ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ Θεοῦ, πορευθεὶς εἰς οὐρανὸν, ὑποταγέντων αὐτῷ ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἐξουσιῶν, καὶ δυνάμεων	1	The phrases **having gone** and **having been subjected** indicate that those two clauses describe events that occurred before the event in the first clause in this verse. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases so that they appear in chronological order. Alternate translation: “after having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to him, he is at the right hand of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:22	g4qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὅς ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Peter uses **right hand** figuratively to refer to the place located at the right side of God in heaven. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who is at God’s right side” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:22	ldrw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅς ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ Θεοῦ	1	In this culture, the place at the **right** side of a ruler was a position of honor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “who is at the place of honor next to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:22	q72i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὑποταγέντων αὐτῷ ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἐξουσιῶν, καὶ δυνάμεων	1	The words **angels**, **authorities**, and **powers** are all terms for the ranks of supernatural beings, both angelic and demonic. If your language does not have three different terms for rulers or authorities, you can combine them. Alternate translation: “all types of supernatural beings having been subjected to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:22	f6jq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑποταγέντων αὐτῷ ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἐξουσιῶν, καὶ δυνάμεων	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God having subjected angels and authorities and powers to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:intro	zh5n				0	# 1 Peter 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n2. How believers should act because the end is near (4:7–11)\n3. How believers should respond to trials (4:12–19)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [verse 18](../04/18.md).\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Ungodly Gentiles\n\nAlthough the term “Gentiles” usually refers to people who are not Jewish, in [verse 3](../04/03.md) Peter uses “Gentiles” to refer to all ungodly people who are not Jews. It does not include Gentiles who have become Christians. Actions like “licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry” were typical of ungodly Gentiles. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Let him” and “Let those”\n\nIn [verses 16–19](../04/16.md) Peter uses these phrases to tell his readers what he wants them to do. Although they are commands that he wants his readers to obey, it is as if he were telling one person what he wants other people to do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate these as commands, like the UST does.
4:1	b8d4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	**Therefore** here refers back to what Peter has said about Jesus’ suffering in [3:18](../03/18.md). If it might help your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Considering what I have written about Christ’s suffering” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:1	ess6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σαρκὶ & σαρκὶ	1	Here, **flesh** refers to the human body, which is made of flesh. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the body … in the body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:1	p2rv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς τὴν αὐτὴν ἔννοιαν ὁπλίσασθε	1	Here Peter uses **arm yourselves** figuratively to refer to preparing one’s mind for something. As soldiers get their weapons ready for battle, so should Christians be mentally prepared to suffer for their faith. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “prepare your minds with the same way of thinking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:1	yxs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν αὐτὴν ἔννοιαν	1	Here Peter uses **the same way of thinking** to refer to Jesus’ **way of thinking** when he suffered. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “with the same way of thinking about suffering that Christ had when he suffered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:1	d66g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πέπαυται ἁμαρτίας	1	Here, **ceased from sin** means “no longer living with a sinful mindset.” The idea is that suffering because of one’s faith indicates that a person is not living sinfully. Christians are often persecuted by unbelievers because they refuse to act sinfully. This phrase does not mean that Christians who suffer never sin. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “has stopped living sinfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	tjdq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς	1	Here, **in order to** introduces a purpose clause. This could mean: (1) this verse states the purpose for ceasing from sin mentioned at the end of the previous verse. Alternate translation (without a comma preceding): “so that he will” (2) this verse states the purpose for the command to “arm yourselves” in the previous verse. Alternate translation (starting a new sentence): “Arm yourselves in order to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:2	d49a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν ἐπίλοιπον ἐν σαρκὶ & χρόνον	1	Peter uses **time in the flesh** figuratively to refer to a person’s lifetime. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the remaining time of your life” or “the rest of your life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:2	fsvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνθρώπων ἐπιθυμίαις	1	Here, **desires** refers specifically to sinful **desires**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the sinful desires of men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	gbb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων ἐπιθυμίαις	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Peter is using the word here in a generic sense to refer to humans in general. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for human desires” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:3	anhj			ἀρκετὸς & ὁ παρεληλυθὼς χρόνος	1	Alternate translation: “enough time has passed”
4:3	efte		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ βούλημα τῶν ἐθνῶν	1	Here Peter uses **Gentiles** figuratively to refer to sinful people who do not know God. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. See the discussion of this term in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “the will of those people who do not know God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	rp5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πεπορευμένους ἐν ἀσελγείαις, ἐπιθυμίαις, οἰνοφλυγίαις, κώμοις, πότοις, καὶ ἀθεμίτοις εἰδωλολατρίαις	1	Peter speaks of these different sins figuratively as if they were places that his readers had formerly **lived in**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having practiced licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	lm35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πεπορευμένους ἐν ἀσελγείαις, ἐπιθυμίαις, οἰνοφλυγίαις, κώμοις, πότοις, καὶ ἀθεμίτοις εἰδωλολατρίαις	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing**, and **idolatry**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “having lived licentious and lustful lives, getting drunk, attending immoral parties and drinking parties, and worshiping prohibited idols” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:4	c4ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ συντρεχόντων ὑμῶν εἰς τὴν αὐτὴν τῆς ἀσωτίας ἀνάχυσιν	1	Peter uses **running into** figuratively to refer to being eager to participate in sinful acts with unbelievers. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are not eagerly joining them to participate in the same outpouring of recklessness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:4	q6k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῆς ἀσωτίας ἀνάχυσιν	1	Peter uses **outpouring** figuratively to refer to acting sinfully to such a high degree that it is as if sin were pouring out of the person like a flood. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “abundant acts of recklessness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:4	w1d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς ἀσωτίας	1	The word **recklessness** refers to dangerous behavior that shows that a person does not care about the consequences of his actions. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “of careless sinning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	datm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἳ ἀποδώσουσιν λόγον	1	Here Peter uses **give** figuratively to refer to speaking something. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they will speak a word” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:5	r288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἳ ἀποδώσουσιν λόγον	1	Here Peter uses **word** figuratively to refer to an explanation that they would speak using words. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they will give an account” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:5	xw39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῷ ἑτοίμως ἔχοντι κρῖναι	1	Here, **the one who is ready to judge** could refer to: (1) God. Alternate translation: “to God, who is ready to judge” (2) Christ. Alternate translation: “to Christ, who is ready to judge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	dx7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ζῶντας καὶ νεκρούς	1	The phrase **living and dead ones** refers to all people, whether they are still alive or have died. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
4:6	u54m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ νεκροῖς εὐηγγελίσθη	1	Here, **dead ones** refers to people who heard the gospel while they were alive but had died by the time Peter wrote this letter. Some people believe that this clause means that Jesus went to hell and preached the gospel to people who had died before Jesus himself died on the cross. However, that idea would contradict the statement in [Hebrews 9:27](../heb/09/27.md) that “men are appointed to die once, and after that, the judgment.” The Bible does not state that God gave anyone a second chance to believe in Jesus after they had already died. If this use of **dead ones** might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the gospel was preached also to those who have since died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:6	ql11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὐηγγελίσθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. This could mean: (1) people preached the gospel. Alternate translation: “people preached the gospel” (2) Christ preached the gospel. Alternate translation: “Christ preached the gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:6	hsg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κριθῶσι & κατὰ ἀνθρώπους σαρκὶ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. This could mean: (1) men judged and persecuted them during their lives according to human standards. Alternate translation: “men judged them in the flesh by human standards” (2) God judged them as humans during their lives. Alternate translation: “God judged them in the flesh as humans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:6	gm1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	κατὰ ἀνθρώπους	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Peter is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “according to people” or “as people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:6	s72f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σαρκὶ	1	Here Peter uses **in the flesh** figuratively to refer to a person’s lifetime. See how you translated this expression in [verse 2](../04/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:6	encm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζῶσι	1	Here, **live** refers to experiencing eternal life. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they might experience eternal life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:6	h154		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζῶσι & πνεύματι	1	Here, **the spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, in which case this phrase would indicate the means by which the people received eternal life. Alternate translation: “they might live by the Spirit” (2) their spiritual existence, in which case this phrase would be referring to the spiritual realm that is contrasted with the physical realm mentioned earlier in the verse with the phrase “in the flesh.” Alternate translation: “they might live spiritually” or “they might live in the spiritual realm” See how you translated the same expression in [3:18](../03/18.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:7	e445		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντων & τὸ τέλος	1	Here, **the end of all things** refers to the end of the world, when Jesus returns and judges everyone. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the end of the world, when Jesus returns,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:7	qs1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἤγγικεν	1	Peter uses **has come near** figuratively to refer to something that will happen soon. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will soon happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:7	ubd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σωφρονήσατε & καὶ νήψατε	1	The words translated as **sound mind** and **sober** mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly since the end of the world is near. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “be completely clearheaded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:7	k5hh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	νήψατε	1	See how you translated **sober** in [1:13](../01/13.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:7	qb4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς προσευχάς	1	Here, **for** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a purpose for his readers to think clearly. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of praying prayers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:8	f1lr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅτι ἀγάπη καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν	1	Peter describes **love** figuratively as if it were a person who could cover something up, and he describes **sins** figuratively as if they were objects that could be covered up. This clause, **covers up**, means that people who love others will forgive them for the sins that they commit against them. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use similes. Alternate translation: “for those who love forgive the many sins committed against them by others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:9	g3vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φιλόξενοι	1	The word **hospitable** refers to showing kindness to and providing for the needs of guests and travelers. This was especially important in Peter’s time because inns were dangerous places where people did many immoral activities, so Christians could not stay in them. If it might be helpful to your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “be those who provide food and a sleeping place” or “be those who provide room and board” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:9	rzbi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	ἄνευ γογγυσμοῦ	1	Here Peter uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “with cheerfulness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
4:10	xvj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕκαστος καθὼς ἔλαβεν χάρισμα	1	Here, **gift** refers to special spiritual abilities that God gives to believers.

4:10	a30t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὡς καλοὶ οἰκονόμοι ποικίλης χάριτος Θεοῦ	1	Peter uses **stewards** figuratively to refer to Christians using spiritual abilities from God to serve other believers as if they were managing resources for a boss. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “as those managing well the diverse grace of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:10	smyw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ποικίλης χάριτος Θεοῦ	1	Peter is using the possessive form to describe **grace** that is given by God. The word **grace** refers to the various spiritual gifts that God graciously gives believers. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “of the diverse, gracious gifts from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:11	b81x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἴ τις λαλεῖ, ὡς λόγια Θεοῦ	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

4:11	vs2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἴ τις διακονεῖ, ὡς ἐξ ἰσχύος ἧς χορηγεῖ ὁ Θεός	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

4:11	ir6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δοξάζηται ὁ Θεὸς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you might glorify God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:11	wq9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ᾧ ἐστιν ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **glory** and **power**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “may he be recognized as glorious and powerful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:12	vw9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ἐν ὑμῖν πυρώσει	1	Peter refers to suffering Christians as if they were gold being refined by being passed through a fire. In the same way that fire refines gold, trials test and strengthen a Christian’s faith. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or with a simile. Alternate translation: “the trial you are experiencing that is refining you like gold is refined in fire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:13	mhj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ἀποκαλύψει τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **revelation** and **glory**, you can express the same ideas in another way. This phrase could mean: (1) Christ will reveal his own glory. Alternate translation: “when he reveals how glorious he is” (2) God will reveal Christ’s glory. Alternate translation: “when God reveals how glorious Christ is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:13	b63p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ ἀποκαλύψει τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **the revelation of his glory** refers to the time in the future when Jesus returns to earth and judges everyone.

Alternate translation: “at the revelation of his glory when he returns to earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:13	rgb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	χαρῆτε ἀγαλλιώμενοι	1	The words **rejoice** and **glad** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the intensity of joy. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you may rejoice even more” or “you may be exceedingly glad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:14	kswc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰ ὀνειδίζεσθε	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “If people revile you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:14	i6ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ὀνόματι Χριστοῦ	1	Here,**name** refers to Christ himself. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “you are people whom God has blessed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:14	i1kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τῆς δόξης καὶ τὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ Πνεῦμα	1	Here, **of glory** and **of God** both refer to the Holy Spirit. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Spirit of glory, who is the Spirit of God” or “the glorious Holy Spirit of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:14	nx6p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἀναπαύεται	1	Here, **rests on you** is an idiom that refers to the Holy Spirit continually dwelling within Christians. Peter borrowed this language from [Isaiah 11:2](../isa/11/02.md) where it originally referred to the Holy Spirit dwelling in the Messiah. The Holy Spirit dwells in the Messiah as well as in those who believe in the Messiah ([John 1:33](../jhn/01/33.md); [14:16–17](../jhn/14/16.md)). The Holy Spirit who dwells within believers provides strength and comfort when believers are persecuted for their faith. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is staying with you” or “remains within you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:15	qzlb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὡς φονεὺς, ἢ κλέπτης, ἢ κακοποιὸς, ἢ ὡς ἀλλοτριεπίσκοπος	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **murderer**, **thief**, **evildoer**, and **meddler**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “as someone who murders, steals, does evil, or as someone who meddles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:15	nr6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀλλοτριεπίσκοπος	1	Here, **meddler** refers to a person who gets involved with the affairs of others without having a right to do so. Alternate translation: “someone who needlessly meddles in the affairs of other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:16	xb0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	μὴ αἰσχυνέσθω, δοξαζέτω δὲ τὸν Θεὸν	1	Peter is addressing his readers indirectly by using the third person. If this might be confusing in your language, you could use the second person, as the previous verse does. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “do not be ashamed, but glorify God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
4:16	xm8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ	1	Here, **this name** refers to the title “Christian” mentioned earlier in the verse. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because he bears the name ‘Christian’” or “because people have recognized him as a Christian” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:17	nawr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁ καιρὸς τοῦ ἄρξασθαι τὸ κρίμα ἀπὸ τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “it is time for God to begin judging the household of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:17	x9np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ οἴκου τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Peter uses **household** figuratively to refer to all believers as if they were a family that belongs to God. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who belong to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:17	v74q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἰ δὲ πρῶτον ἀφ’ ἡμῶν	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the the previous clause. Alternate translation: “but if it is time for judgment to begin first with us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:17	phx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀφ’ ἡμῶν	1	When Peter says **us**, he is speaking of himself and his readers, so **us** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:17	c8ke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί τὸ τέλος τῶν ἀπειθούντων τῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ εὐαγγελίῳ?	1	Peter is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphasize that God’s judgment will be more severe for people who reject the gospel than for those who believe it. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “how terrible will be the end of the ones disobeying the gospel of God!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:17	e5fn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1	Here, **end** refers to the final result of the lives of people who do not believe in Jesus. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the final result” or “the outcome” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:17	z9zc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἀπειθούντων	1	Here, **disobeying** refers to disobeying the command to repent and believe the gospel, which is part of the gospel message. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2:8](../02/08.md). Alternate translation: “of the ones refusing to believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:17	l3db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ εὐαγγελίῳ	1	Here, **the gospel of God** could refer to: (1) the gospel that came from God. Alternate translation: “the gospel from God” (2) the gospel that is about God. Alternate translation: “the gospel about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:18	re8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καὶ	1	**And** here introduces a quotation from an Old Testament book ([Proverbs 11:31](../pro/11/31)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Peter is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “And Solomon wrote in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
4:18	f7kx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	εἰ ὁ δίκαιος μόλις σῴζεται, ὁ ἀσεβὴς καὶ ἁμαρτωλὸς ποῦ φανεῖται?	1	This sentence is a quotation from [Proverbs 11:31](../pro/11/31). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:18	t762		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰ ὁ δίκαιος μόλις σῴζεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “If with difficulty God is saving the righteous one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:18	i6nz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ δίκαιος & ὁ ἀσεβὴς καὶ ἁμαρτωλὸς	1	Peter is speaking of these types of people in general, and not of specific, individual people. If this would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase. Alternate translation: “righteous ones … ungodly and sinful ones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
4:18	w8ke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὁ ἀσεβὴς καὶ ἁμαρτωλὸς ποῦ φανεῖται?	1	Peter is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphasize that ungodly people will suffer much more than believers do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “the ungodly and sinner will surely not appear!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:18	ms54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ ἀσεβὴς καὶ ἁμαρτωλὸς ποῦ φανεῖται	1	Here, the combination of **where will** and **appear** is an idiom meaning “what will happen.” If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:18	wb4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὁ ἀσεβὴς καὶ ἁμαρτωλὸς	1	The words **ungodly** and **sinner** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the wickedness of these people. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “the ungodly sinners” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:19	qm3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὰς ψυχὰς	1	See how you translated **souls** in [1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

5:intro	a6d9				0	# 1 Peter 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. How believers should interact with one another (5:1–11)\n2. Conclusion (5:12–14)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Lion\n\nOther animals are usually afraid of lions because they are fast and strong, and they eat almost every other kind of animal. They also eat people. Satan wants to make God’s people afraid, so Peter uses the simile of a lion to teach his readers that Satan can harm their bodies, but if they trust in God and obey him, they will always be God’s people, and God will care for them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Babylon\n\nBabylon was the evil nation that had destroyed Jerusalem, taken the Jews away from their homes, and ruled over them. In other places in Scripture, the authors use Babylon as a metaphor for the enemies of God’s people. In [verse 13](../05/13.md) Peter uses Babylon as a metaphor for the nation that was persecuting the Christians to whom he was writing. Most scholars believe that here Peter is referring to Rome because the Romans were severely persecuting Christians there at that time. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:1	s8fr			General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\nIn [verses 1–4](../05/01.md) Peter speaks directly to men who are leaders in the churches.
5:1	m4xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρεσβυτέρους & ὁ συνπρεσβύτερος	1	In [verses 1–5](../05/01.md) the words **elder** and **elders** refer specifically to church leaders, who were often older men. Here these words do not refer to old men in general. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the fellow church leader … the church leaders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:1	n3em		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μάρτυς τῶν τοῦ Χριστοῦ παθημάτων	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **witness** and **sufferings**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “one who has witnessed Christ suffer in many ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:1	a6ve		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῆς μελλούσης ἀποκαλύπτεσθαι δόξης	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “in the glory that God is about to reveal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:1	wead		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς & δόξης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in the glorious nature of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:1	yb3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς μελλούσης ἀποκαλύπτεσθαι δόξης	1	The phrase **the glory that is about to be revealed** refers to Christ’s glorious return to earth in the future. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the glory that is about to be revealed when Christ returns” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:2	f63v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποιμάνατε τὸ & ποίμνιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Peter uses **Shepherd** figuratively to refer to leading and taking care of believers, and he uses **flock** figuratively to refer to those believers. Elders who lead assemblies of believers should take care of those believers like shepherds take care of their sheep. Since the shepherd and sheep metaphors are important metaphors in the Bible, you should keep the metaphors in your translation or use similes. Alternate translation: “Take care of God’s people as if they were a flock of sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:2	dvai		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπισκοποῦντες μὴ ἀναγκαστῶς	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **oversight** and **compulsion**, you can express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “supervising—not because you must do so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:2	zfei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐπισκοποῦντες μὴ ἀναγκαστῶς	1	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “exercising oversight over them—not doing this under compulsion” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:2	k4dk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	μὴ ἀναγκαστῶς, ἀλλὰ ἑκουσίως	1	The phrases **not under compulsion** and **willingly** mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that Peter wants church leaders to voluntarily take care of believers. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “with complete willingness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:2	cp7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατὰ Θεόν	1	This phrase refers to acting according to God’s will or requirements. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “according to God’s will” or “as God wants you to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:2	c6qf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	μηδὲ αἰσχροκερδῶς, ἀλλὰ προθύμως	1	The phrases **not greedily** and **eagerly** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that Peter wants church leaders to eagerly take care of believers. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you can use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “with complete eagerness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:3	lta9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὡς κατακυριεύοντες	1	Here Peter uses **lording it over** figuratively to refer to acting toward people in a harsh and controlling manner, as if someone were a harsh master who abuses his servants. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “harshly controlling” or “acting like harsh masters over” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:3	xwr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῶν κλήρων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **portion**, you can express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “those who are assigned to you” or “those whom God has apportioned to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:3	n485		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τύποι γινόμενοι τοῦ ποιμνίου	1	Peter is using the possessive form to describe **examples** that are for **the flock**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “being examples for the flock” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:3	vg31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ ποιμνίου	1	See how you translated **flock** in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	oz14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	**And** here indicates that what follows is the result of obeying the commands that Peter gave in [verses 2–3](../05/02.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a result clause. Alternate translation: “As a result of doing these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:4	pfjr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ ἀρχιποίμενος	1	**Chief Shepherd** is a title for Jesus. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus, the Chief Shepherd” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:4	td11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ ἀρχιποίμενος	1	Here Peter speaks of Jesus figuratively as if he were a **shepherd** who has authority over all the leaders of the assemblies of believers. Peter told those leaders to shepherd their flocks in [verse 2](../05/02.md). Since **Chief Shepherd** is an important title for Jesus that connects to some prophecies about the Messiah in the Old Testament, you should keep the metaphor in your translation or use a simile. Alternate translation: “the one who is like a lead shepherd” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	qlek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φανερωθέντος τοῦ ἀρχιποίμενος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when the Chief Shepherd appears” or “when God reveals the Chief Shepherd” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:4	ll4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν ἀμαράντινον τῆς δόξης στέφανον	1	Here,**crown** refers to a symbol of victory. It does not refer to the type of **crown** that kings wear. In ancient times an athlete would receive this **crown** as a reward for winning a competition. Those crowns were often made of leaves or flowers that would fade.
