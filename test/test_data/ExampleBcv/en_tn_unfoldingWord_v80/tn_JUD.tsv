front:intro	xh5n				0	# Introduction to Jude\n\n## Part 1: General introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Jude\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n2. Warning against false teachers (1:3–4)\n3. Comparison of false teachers to Old Testament examples (1:5–16)\n4. Exhortation to live godly lives in response (1:17–23)\n5. Praises to God (1:24–25)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Jude?\n\nThe author identified himself as Jude, the brother of James. Both Jude and James were half-brothers of Jesus. It is unknown whether this letter was intended for a specific church.\n\n### What is the book of Jude about?\n\nJude wrote this letter to warn believers against false teachers. Jude often referred to the Old Testament. This may suggest that Jude was writing to a Jewish Christian audience. This letter and 2 Peter have similar content. They both speak about angels, Sodom and Gomorrah, and false teachers.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Jude.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Letter from Jude” or “The Letter Jude Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important religious and cultural concepts\n\n### Who were the people Jude spoke against?\n\nIt is possible that the people Jude spoke against were those who would later become known as Gnostics. These teachers distorted the teachings of Scripture for their own gain. They lived in immoral ways and taught others to do the same.\n\n## Part 3: Important translation issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Jude. Also, the word “you” is always plural and refers to Jude’s audience. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Peter?\n\nFor the following verse, there are differences between some of the ancient manuscripts. The ULT text follows the reading that most scholars consider to be original and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the language of wider communication in the region, translators may want to consider using the reading found in that version. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.\n* “that Jesus, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt” [(v. 5)](../01/05.md). Some ancient manuscripts have, “that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:1	ek3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Ἰούδας	1	In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Jude, am writing this letter” or “From Jude” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:1	npc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰούδας	1	**Jude** is the name of a man, the brother of James. See the information about him in Part 1 of the Introduction to Jude. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

He describes himself as being both **a servant of Jesus Christ** and **a brother of James**. This distinguishes him from the two other men named Jude in the New Testament, which English translations usually distinguish from Jude by translating their names as “Judas”.

1:1	m3v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀδελφὸς & Ἰακώβου	1	**James** and Jude were half brothers of Jesus. Joseph was their physical father, but he was not the physical father of Jesus.

1:1	p5yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τοῖς	1	In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person.

1:1	din3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κλητοῖς	1	That these people have been **called** implies that God has called and saved them. Alternate translation: “and whom God has called and saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

1:2	wjsn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	ἔλεος ὑμῖν, καὶ εἰρήνη, καὶ ἀγάπη πληθυνθείη.	1	In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Use a form in your language that makes it clear that this is a greeting and blessing. Alternate translation: “May God increase his mercy and peace and love to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:2	r5ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔλεος ὑμῖν, καὶ εἰρήνη, καὶ ἀγάπη πληθυνθείη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **mercy**, **peace**, and **love** by stating the ideas behind them with equivalent expressions.

1:2	q2qo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔλεος & καὶ εἰρήνη, καὶ ἀγάπη πληθυνθείη.	1	Jude speaks of **mercy and peace and love** as if they were objects that could increase in size or numbers.

1:3	ls3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	παρακαλῶν ἐπαγωνίζεσθαι τῇ & πίστει	1	Jude is leaving out the word “you” that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. This word can be supplied from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “exhorting you to contend for the faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:3	pvyp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τῇ ἅπαξ παραδοθείσῃ τοῖς ἁγίοις πίστει	1	If your language does not use the passive form **delivered**, you state who did the action. Alternate translation: “for the faith that God delivered once for all to the saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:3	j67u			ἅπαξ	1	Here, **once for all** expresses the idea of something that was done only once and never again. The meaning of **for all** is “for all time.” It does not mean “for the sake of all people.”
1:4	he1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, **For** indicates that Jude is giving a reason for why he said in the previous verse that he wants his readers to “contend for the faith.” Alternate translation: “I want you do to this because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

1:4	qevn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	παρεισέδυσαν γάρ τινες ἄνθρωποι	1	In this phrase, Jude is leaving out words from this sentence that it would need in many languages in order to be complete. If this phrase is required in your language, it can be supplied from verse [12](../01/12.md). Alternate translation: “For certain men have entered secretly into your love feasts” or “For certain men have entered secretly into your gatherings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

1:4	c642		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν χάριτα μετατιθέντες εἰς ἀσέλγειαν	1	Here, God’s **grace** is spoken of figuratively as if it were a thing that could be changed into something sinful. If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate this in a non-figurative way. The false teachers were teaching that believers could do sexually immoral acts because God’s grace allowed it. Paul addressed this kind of false teaching when he wrote in Romans 6:1-2a: “Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound? May it never be!” Alternate translation: “teaching that God’s grace permits licentiousness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

1:4	p7g6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν μόνον Δεσπότην καὶ Κύριον ἡμῶν	1	Here, **Lord** means “the person who is lord over us” or “the person who rules over us.” The conjunction **and** indicates that **our** also applies back to **only Master**, meaning “the person who owns us.” Alternate translation: “the only person who owns us and rules over us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:5	z1h9			λαὸν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου σώσας	1	This could mean that: (1) Jude is indicating the timing of the event described in this clause, in which case the timing is made clear by the occurrence of “afterward” in the next clause. (2) Jude is making a contrast between what Jesus did in this clause and what he did in the next. Alternate translation: “although he saved a people out of the land of Egypt”

Alternate translation: “God has kept in eternal chains, under darkness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:6	c8gf			δεσμοῖς ἀϊδίοις & τετήρηκεν	1	Here, **kept in eternal chains** refers to imprisonment that lasts forever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include the idea of imprisonment in your translation. Alternate translations: “God has imprisoned for eternity”
1:6	s1j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑπὸ ζόφον	1	Here, **darkness** is a metonym which represents the place of the dead or hell. Alternate translation: “in the utter darkness of hell” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

1:7	r3e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τὸν ὅμοιον τρόπον τούτοις	1	Here, **these** refers to the angels mentioned in the previous verse. The sexual sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were the result of the same kind of rebellion as the angels’ evil ways. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this phrase explicitly.

1:8	ez4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σάρκα μὲν μιαίνουσιν	1	Here, **flesh** refers to the bodies of these false teachers.

1:11	j3g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ Κάϊν ἐπορεύθησαν	1	Here, **have gone in the way** is a metaphor for “have lived in the same way as.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this metaphor in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “they have lived the same way Cain lived” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:11	yg9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Κάϊν	1	Here Jude compares the false teachers to **Cain**. Jude assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Genesis. In that story, Cain made an unacceptable offering to God, and God rejected his offering. As a result he became angry and was jealous of his brother Abel, because God had accepted Abel’s offering. Cain’s anger and jealousy led him to murder his brother. God punished Cain by banishing him from farming the land. Additionally, at the time Jude wrote this letter, Jews considered Cain to be an example of someone who taught other people how to sin, which is what these false teachers were doing. You could indicate some of this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation, as a statement: “of Cain, who murdered his brother” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

When God did not allow Balaam to do so, Balaam used wicked women to seduce the Israelites into sexual immorality and idol worship so that God would punish them for their disobedience. Balaam did these wicked things because he wanted to be paid by the wicked kings, but he was eventually killed by the Israelites when they conquered the land of Canaan. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation, as a statement: “of Balaam, who led the Israelites into immorality for money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:11	qlof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Κόρε	1	Here Jude compares the false teachers to **Korah**. Jude assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, Korah was a man of Israel who led a rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron, whom God had appointed. God killed Korah and all those who rebelled with him by burning some of them and opening up the ground to swallow up the others. You could indicate some of this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation, as a statement: “of Korah, who rebelled against God’s appointed leaders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:11	tspu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἀπώλοντο	1	Jude is figuratively using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future.

Alternate translation: “they are like hidden reefs” or “although they are inconspicuous, these people are extremely dangerous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:12	aq79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ταῖς ἀγάπαις	1	Here, **love feasts** refers to gatherings of Christians where they ate a meal together.

1:12	gs99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δένδρα φθινοπωρινὰ ἄκαρπα	1	Here Jude again speaks figuratively of the false teachers to describe their uselessness. People expect trees in the autumn to provide fruit, but **fruitless autumn trees** disappoint them.

Alternate translation: “they make their shameful deeds visible to everyone” or “they show their shameful deeds like waves leave foam” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:13	r6rj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀστέρες πλανῆται	1	Here, the phrase **wandering stars** describes **stars** that have wandered away from their normal path of movement.

1:13	djm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἷς ὁ ζόφος τοῦ σκότους εἰς αἰῶνα τετήρηται	1	If your language does not use the passive form **has been kept**, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who did the action.
