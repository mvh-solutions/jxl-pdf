Main Theme: Righteousness is received by trusting in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)\n3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)\n4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)\n5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)\n6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)\n7. Instructions for living as Christians (12:1–15:13)\n8. Conclusion (15:14–16:27)\n\n### Who wrote the book of Romans?\n\nThe Apostle Paul wrote the book of Romans and many other books in the New Testament. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was part of a strict Jewish religious group called the Pharisees. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul probably wrote this letter while he was staying in the city of Corinth during his third trip through the Roman Empire.\n\n### What is the book of Romans about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the Christians in Rome. Paul wanted to get them ready to receive him when he visited them. He said his purpose was to “bring about the obedience of faith” ([16:26](../16/26.md)).\n\nIn this letter Paul most fully described the gospel of Jesus Christ. He explained that both Jews and non-Jews have sinned, and God will forgive them and declare them righteous only if they believe in Jesus (chapters 1–11). Then he gave them practical advice for how believers should live (chapters 12–16),\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Romans.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Rome,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Rome.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What are the titles used to refer to Jesus?\n\nIn Romans, Paul described Jesus Christ by many titles and descriptions: Jesus Christ ([1:1](../01/01.md)), the Seed of David ([1:3](../01/03.md)), the Son of God ([1:4](../01/04.md)), the Lord Jesus Christ ([1:7](../01/07.md)), Christ Jesus ([3:24](../03/24.md)), Propitiation ([3:25](../03/025.md)), Jesus ([3:26](../03/26.md)), Jesus our Lord ([4:24](../04/24.md)), Lord of Hosts ([9:29](../09/29.md)), a Stone of Stumbling and Rock of Offense ([9:33](../09/33.md)), the End of the Law ([10:4](../10/04.md)), the Deliverer ([11:26](../11/26.md)), Lord of the Dead and the Living ([14:9](../14/09.md)), and the Root of Jesse ([15:12](../15/12.md)).\n\n### How should theological terms in Romans be translated?\n\nPaul uses many theological terms that are not used in the four Gospels. As early Christians learned more about the meaning of Jesus Christ and his message, they needed words and expressions for new ideas. Some examples of these words are “justification” ([5:1](../05/01.md)), “works of the law” ([3:20](../03/20.md)), “reconcile” ([5:10](../05/10.md)), “propitiation” ([3:25](../03/25.md)), “sanctification” ([6:19](../06/19.md)), and “the old man” ([6:6](../06/06.md)). If your language doesn’t have similar words, you can develop short phrases to communicate these ideas. For example, the term “gospel” can be translated as “the good news about Jesus Christ.”\n\nTranslators should also remember that some of these terms have more than one meaning. The meaning will depend on how the author is using the word in that particular passage. For example, “righteousness” sometimes means that a person obeys God’s law. At other times, “righteousness” means that Jesus Christ has perfectly obeyed God’s law for us.\n\n### What did Paul mean by “a remnant” of Israel ([11:5](../11/05.md))?\n\nThe idea of a “remnant” is important both in the Old Testament and for Paul. Most of the Israelites were either killed or scattered among other people when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians conquered their land. Only a relatively few Jews survived. They were known as “the remnant.”\n\nIn [11:1–9](../11/01.md), Paul speaks of another remnant. This remnant is the Jews whom God saved because they believed in Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by being “in Christ”?\n\nThe phrase “in Christ” and similar phrases occur in [3:24](../03/24.md); [6:11](../06/11.md), [23](../06/23.md); [8:1](../08/01.md), [2](../08/02.md), [39](../08/39.md); [9:1](../09/01.md); [12:5](../12/05.md), [17](../12/17.md); [15:17](../15/17.md); and [16:3](../16/03.md), [7](../16/07.md), [9](../16/09.md), [10](../16/10.md). Paul used these kinds of phrases as a metaphor to express that Christian believers belong to Jesus Christ. Belonging to Christ means the believer is saved and is made a friend with God. The believer is also promised to live with God forever. However, this idea can be difficult to represent in many languages.\n\nThese phrases also have specific meanings that depend on how Paul used them in a particular passage. For example, in [3:24](../03/24.md) (“the redemption that is in Christ Jesus”), Paul referred to our being redeemed “because” of Jesus Christ. In [8:9](../08/09.md) (“you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit”), Paul spoke of believers submitting “to” the Holy Spirit. In [9:1](../09/01.md) (“I tell the truth in Christ”), Paul meant that he is telling the truth that “is in agreement with” Jesus Christ.\n\nNevertheless, the basic idea of our being united with Jesus Christ (and with the Holy Spirit) is seen in these passages as well. Therefore, the translator has a choice in many passages that use “in.” He will often decide to represent the more immediate sense of “in,” such as, “by means of,” “in the manner of,” or “in regard to.” But, if possible, the translator should choose a word or phrase that represents the immediate sense and the sense of “in union with.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inchrist]])\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy,” “saints” or “holy ones,” and “sanctify” represented in Romans in the ULT?\n\nThe Scriptures use such words to indicate any one of some various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God considers Christians to be sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact is that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless and faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones” or “holy people.” (See: [1:7](../01/07.md))\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In cases where some other English versions have “saints” or “holy ones,” the ULT uses “believers.” (See: [8:27](../08/27.md); [12:13](../12/13.md); [15:25](../15/25.md), [26](../15/26.md), [31](../15/31.md); [16:2](../16/02.md), [15](../16/15.md))\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage indicates the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “set apart,” “dedicated to,” “consecrated,” or “reserved for.” (See: [15:16](../15/16.md))\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Romans?\n\nFor the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT includes the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote.\n\n* “he \\[God\\] works all things together for good” ([8:28](../08/28.md)). Some older versions read, “All things work together for good.”\n* “But if it is by grace, it is no longer by works. Otherwise grace would no longer be grace” ([11:6](../11/06.md)). Some older versions read: “But if it is by works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.”\n\nThe following verse is not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Translators are advised not to include this verse. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have this verse, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the book of Romans.\n\n* “May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen” ([16:24](../16/24.md)).\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	hn5n				0	# Romans 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–15)\n    * Greeting (1:1–7)\n    * Paul plans to visit Rome (1:8–15)\n2. Main Theme: Righteousness is received by having faith in Jesus Christ (1:16–17)\n3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)\n    * All non-Jews have sinned (1:18–32)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The gospel\n\nThis chapter refers to the contents of the book of Romans as “the gospel” ([1:2](../rom/01/02.md)). Romans is not a Gospel as are Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, which are historical accounts of the life of Jesus. Instead, chapters 1–8 present the biblical gospel, which is the good news of salvation. The gospel contains the following true ideas: everyone has sinned, Jesus died for our sins, and Jesus came back to life again so that we might live for his glory and receive eternal life when we die.\n\n### Universal Condemnation and the Wrath of God\n\nIn this chapter Paul explains that no one has an excuse for sinning. We all know about the true God, Yahweh, from his creation all around us. Because of our sin and our sinful nature, every person justly deserves the eternal punishment of God. The requirement for this punishment was satisfied by Jesus dying on a cross for those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “God gave them over”\n\nMany scholars view the phrases “God gave them over” and “God gave them up” as theologically significant. For this reason, it is important to translate these phrases with God playing a passive role in the action. God allows men to pursue their own sinful desires; he does not force them to act sinfully. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

2:19	ql0b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τυφλῶν	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “to blind people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:19	j76c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὁδηγὸν & τυφλῶν, φῶς τῶν ἐν σκότει	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how strongly the Jews believed that non-Jews were ignorant about God’s truth. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the two ideas into one. Alternate translation: “the only ones who can guide those who are unaware of what is true about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:19	xlge		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φῶς τῶν ἐν σκότει	1	Here Paul uses **light** to refer to a Jewish person, and he uses **those in darkness** figuratively to refer to non-Jews. He means that the Jews think they can teach non-Jews about God the way that a **light** shines on people who are in a dark place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “someone who can reveal what is true about God to those who do not know about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	ymey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	παιδευτὴν ἀφρόνων, διδάσκαλον νηπίων, ἔχοντα τὴν μόρφωσιν τῆς γνώσεως καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας ἐν τῷ νόμῳ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases, since the third phrase gives the reason for the result that the first two phrases describe. Alternate translation: “since having in the law the form of the knowledge and of the truth, you believe you should be an instructor of foolish men, a teacher of little children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:20	pf6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	παιδευτὴν ἀφρόνων, διδάσκαλον νηπίων, ἔχοντα & ἐν τῷ νόμῳ	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how strongly the Jews believed that non-Jews were ignorant about God’s truth. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “the only people who can instruct those people who are as foolish as children and are the only people who have in the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:20	ar5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διδάσκαλον νηπίων	1	Paul speaks of the non-Jews as if they were **little children**. He means that they are ignorant about God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternative translation: “people who are spiritually ignorant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	ose0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχοντα τὴν μόρφωσιν τῆς γνώσεως καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας ἐν τῷ νόμῳ	1	Paul speaks of **the law** as if it were a physical shape that someone could possess. He means that **the law** contains God’s true knowledge that the Jews think they exclusively own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “understanding through God’s law how a person can truly know God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	ua61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν μόρφωσιν τῆς γνώσεως καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Paul is using the possessive forms **of the knowledge** and **of the truth** to describe the **form** of **the law**. Here, **of knowledge** and **of the truth** could indicate: (1) what **the law** contains. Alternate translation: “the form that contains the knowledge and the truth” (2) what **the law** represents. Alternate translation: “what represents knowledge and truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:20	y6i5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς γνώσεως καὶ τῆς ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **knowledge** and ** truth**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “of what we know about God and what is true about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:21	vy0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὁ οὖν διδάσκων ἕτερον, σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις? ὁ κηρύσσων μὴ κλέπτειν, κλέπτεις?	1	In [2:21–23](../02/21.md) Paul transitions from his description of the Jews in [2:17–20](../02/17.md) to a series of rhetorical questions. These questions emphasize the hypocrisy of the Jews, who thought they were superior to non-Jews because they knew the law of Moses. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate Paul’s words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “then you, who teach another, do not teach yourself! You, who preach not to steal, actually steal!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:21	rftq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	Here, **then** indicates that what follows is the second half of the factual conditional statement that Paul began with “if you name yourself a Jew” in [2:17](../02/17.md). Paul wants to show that what the Jews believe and how they live are in contrast. If you divided [2:17–21](../02/17.md) into separate sentences, then you may need to include a short form of the “if” statement here. Alternate translation: “if all this is really true, then” or “since all this is really true, then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:21	uq9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ἕτερον	1	Here, **another** is a singular pronoun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular pronouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
2:21	abq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σεαυτὸν οὐ διδάσκεις	1	Here Paul implies that the Jews need to **teach** themselves, because they do not actually obey the laws that they teach. They live their lives as if they do not know the law of Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “since you yourself don’t obey the law, do you not teach yourself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:22	parm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὁ λέγων μὴ μοιχεύειν, μοιχεύεις? ὁ βδελυσσόμενος τὰ εἴδωλα, ἱεροσυλεῖς?	1	Like in the previous verse, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form twice to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as statements or exclamations and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You who say not to commit adultery actually commit adultery! You who abhor idols actually rob temples!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:22	dmpg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἱεροσυλεῖς	1	Here Paul implies that the **temples** the Jews **rob** are where **idols** are kept and worshiped. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “do you rob temples where idols are kept” or “should you actually enter an idol temple and rob it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:23	z80m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου, τὸν Θεὸν ἀτιμάζεις	1	As in the previous two verses, Paul is not asking for information here, but is using the question form to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You who boast in the law actually dishonor God through the transgression of the law!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:23	grr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὃς ἐν νόμῳ καυχᾶσαι	1	Paul uses **in the law** as if it were something that people could boast inside of. He means that the Jews brag that they are the only nation who knows God’s law, which has similar meaning to “boast in God” in [2:17](../02/17.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation, “You, who brag that you are the only ones who know God’s law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:23	ob98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς παραβάσεως τοῦ νόμου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **transgression**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “by transgressing the law” or “by breaking the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:24	yp4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τὸ γὰρ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν, καθὼς γέγραπται	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “For, just as it is written, ‘the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:24	z54i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that what follows is the reason why the previous statement is true. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “These things that I have said about you are true because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:24	lk5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τὸ & ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1	In this clause Paul quotes part of [Isaiah 52:5](../isa/52/05.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:24	c4sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ & ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul is using the possessive form to indicate the **name** that belongs to **God**. Paul does not mean that **God** is a **name**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “God’s name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:24	mvwq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸ & ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses **the name of God** figuratively to refer to**God** himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:24	ccm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ & ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:24	m2bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τὸ & ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ ὑμᾶς βλασφημεῖται ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because of you the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:24	pg0g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	Paul quotes Isaiah implying that the bad behavior of the Jews is what causes **the Gentiles** to blaspheme **the name of God**. Since the Jews were supposed to represent God to the world, their bad behavior misrepresented God so that the Gentiles blasphemed him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a result of how you act” or “because of the way you behave” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:24	e144		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	Here, **you** is the plural and refers to the Jewish people. This is the only occurrence of plural **you** in [2:17–27](../02/17.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “you Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2:24	edrf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Since Paul is referring to something Isaiah wrote, you could indicate Isaiah as the subject. Alternate translation: “just as Isaiah wrote” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:24	end9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καθὼς γέγραπται	1	See how you translated this phrase in [1:17](../01/17.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
2:25	vdu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that [2:25–29] provide another reason why both Jews and Gentiles will be punished for their sins, as stated in [2:12](../02/12.md). Paul is arguing against the idea that circumcision guaranteed a Jew’s salvation, which some Jews believed. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “Jews will be judged along with Gentiles because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:25	vp6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	περιτομὴ & ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **circumcision** and **uncircumcision**, you could express the same ideas in a different way. Alternate translation: “being circumcised … your being circumcised has become being uncircumcised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:25	wm24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὠφελεῖ	1	Paul is leaving out a word here that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the word from the context. Alternate translation: “benefits you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:25	pqhz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	παραβάτης νόμου	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe a person who transgresses **the law**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “one who transgresses the law” or “one who breaks the law”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:25	xq62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἡ περιτομή σου, ἀκροβυστία γέγονεν	1	Here, **your circumcision becomes uncircumcision** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how important it is for God’s people to **practice the law**. Paul does not mean that the person who transgresses God’s **law** is no longer physically circumcised. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it is as if you were not circumcised” or “it is the same as if you were never circumcised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:26	vt7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν οὖν	1	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to help his readers recognize the benefits for **the uncircumcised one** who **keeps the requirements of the law**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Let’s suppose then that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
2:26	r9i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἡ ἀκροβυστία	1	Paul is using the adjective **uncircumcision** as a noun in order to describe a group of people.

Alternate translation: “the one who is uncircumcised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:26	nf3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	φυλάσσῃ	1	Here, **keeps** is an idiom that refers to obeying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is obedient to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:26	mkhr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ δικαιώματα τοῦ νόμου	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe **requirements** found in **the law**.

2:26	be71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχ ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ εἰς περιτομὴν λογισθήσεται	1	Paul is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize how important it is do what **the law** requires. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “certainly God will consider his uncircumcision to be circumcision” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:26	rjb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐχ ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ εἰς περιτομὴν λογισθήσεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “will God not consider his uncircumcision to be circumcision” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:26	gjuy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἀκροβυστία αὐτοῦ & περιτομὴν	1	See how you translated **uncircumcision** and **circumcision** in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:27	lqz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	κρινεῖ ἡ ἐκ φύσεως ἀκροβυστία, τὸν νόμον τελοῦσα	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “since he is fulfilling the law, the uncircumcised by nature will judge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:27	tpno		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἡ & ἀκροβυστία	1	See how you translated this in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

2:27	nxa1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	γράμματος	1	Paul is describing **the law** by association with the letters that make up **the law**.

2:28	g2vh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that what follows is the reason for what has just been stated. This verse is Paul’s conclusion to the statements he made in [2:25–27](../02/25.md). Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “In fact” or “Truly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:28	lfuj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Ἰουδαῖός	1	Here Paul uses **Jew** to refer to someone who is one of God’s people because he truly trusts in God for salvation, as Abraham did. **Jew** here does not refer to someone who only has Jewish ancestors. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a spiritual Jew” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:28	rohy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ φανερῷ	1	Here, **visibly** refers to the Jewish religious practices that other people can see, such as circumcision or wearing special clothing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “does externally visible Jewish rituals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:28	n34i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ & περιτομή	1	Here Paul uses **circumcision** to refer to the change in thinking and attitude that happens when God saves a person. It can also be considered an inward mark of belonging to God’s people, like how circumcision was an outer mark of being Jewish. This was called “circumcision of the heart” in the Old Testament ([Deuteronomy 30:6](../deu/30/06.md); [Jeremiah 4:4](../jer/04/04.md)). Here, **circumcision** does not refer to the Jewish ritual. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this spiritual circumcision” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:28	s44m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν σαρκὶ	1	Paul uses **the flesh** figuratively to mean “the whole body,” which is made of **flesh**.

2:29	hbiv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	περιτομὴ καρδίας	1	The phrase **circumcision of the heart** is an idiom that refers to the change in thinking and attitude that happens when God saves a person. It can also be considered an inward mark of belonging to God’s people, just as circumcision was an outer mark of being Jewish. This expression first occurred in the Old Testament ([Deuteronomy 30:6](../deu/30/06.md); [Jeremiah 4:4](../jer/04/04.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. See how you translated “this circumcision” in the previous verse.

2:29	kjc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν Πνεύματι	1	Here, **the Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, who changes a person’s thoughts and attitude when God saves that person, as in the UST. (2) a person’s spirit, which would require interpreting **in** to refer to a place. Alternate translation: “in one’s spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

3:intro	y2kb				0	# Romans 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. All mankind is condemned because of sin (1:18–3:20)\n    * All non-Jews have sinned (1:18–32)\n    * All Jews have sinned (2:1–3:8)\n    * Everyone has sinned (3:9–20)\n4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)\n    * God’s righteousness is received through faith (3:21–26)\n    * No one can boast in works (3:27–31)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses [10–18](../03/10.md) of this chapter, which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nIn [3:1–9](../03/01.md) and [27–31](../03/27.md) Paul frequently uses rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to answer objections that Jews might make about what he is saying. You may need to indicate that Paul is asking these questions as if he were a non-Christian Jew responding to these arguments. When Paul asks the rhetorical questions, he is speaking as if he were a non-Christian Jew arguing against Paul. When Paul answers those questions, he is speaking as himself. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this change in speakers with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate quotations, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

Paul is not asking for information, but here he is using these two questions to express the objections that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [2:28–29](../02/28.md). If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

3:28	jb14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a different form. Alternate translation: “by believing in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:28	ycx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἔργων νόμου	1	Paul is using the possessive form to refer to **the works** that God requires in **the law**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the works that the law requires” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:29	hdbq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	**Or** here indicates that the next two sentences are the responses that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous verse.

3:29	ineu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐχὶ καὶ ἐθνῶν? ναὶ, καὶ ἐθνῶν	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that these sentences would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “Is he not also God of Gentiles? Yes, he is also God of Gentiles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:29	m8eo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐθνῶν & ἐθνῶν	1	See how you translated **Gentiles** in [1:5](../01/05.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:29	ch7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Ἰουδαίων ὁ Θεὸς μόνον? οὐχὶ καὶ ἐθνῶν?	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using these two questions here to express the responses that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous verse. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “God is surely not only the God of Jews! He is surely also the God of Gentiles!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:29	rq5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ναὶ, καὶ ἐθνῶν	1	In this sentence Paul responds to the rhetorical questions in the previous two sentences.

3:30	vur7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴπερ	1	Paul uses **if** as if the rest of the verse were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation, (without either comma preceding): “Since we know” or “Because it is true that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:30	qdiu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἴπερ	1	This phrase introduces the reason why Paul could say in the previous verse that God is also the God of the Gentiles.

3:30	ux30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	Paul speaks of **God** as if he were a number. He means that **God** is the **one** and only true **God** for both Jews and Gentiles.

3:30	rjxp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὃς δικαιώσει περιτομὴν ἐκ πίστεως, καὶ ἀκροβυστίαν διὰ τῆς πίστεως	1	This phrase gives further information about **who** our **God** is. It is not making a distinction between the one true **God** and false gods. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “he is the one who will justify the circumcision by faith, and he will justify the uncircumcision through the same faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
3:30	kw62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	περιτομὴν & ἀκροβυστίαν	1	The words **circumcision** and **uncircumcision** are singular nouns that refer to groups of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the circumcised people … the uncircumcised people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
3:30	gk5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	περιτομὴν & ἀκροβυστίαν	1	Here Paul uses **the circumcision** to refer to the Jews by associating them with **circumcision**, and he uses **the uncircumcision** figuratively to refer to the Gentiles by associating them with **uncircumcision**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people … the non-Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:30	s9i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐκ πίστεως & διὰ τῆς πίστεως	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:26](../03/26.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:31	vj40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	νόμον οὖν καταργοῦμεν	1	Here, **then** indicates that this sentence is the response that a Jew might have made to what Paul said in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then you Jews might say, ‘Do we nullify the law’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:31	y6qx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	νόμον οὖν καταργοῦμεν διὰ τῆς πίστεως	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using this question to express the response that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous verse. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then we surely nullify the law through the same faith!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:31	nzr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οὖν καταργοῦμεν	1	Here, **we** is used exclusively to speak of the unbelieving Jews on whose behalf Paul is speaking. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “Do we Jews then nullify” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:31	cw0k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νόμον οὖν καταργοῦμεν	1	Here, **nullify the law** means to make **the law** useless or no longer applicable to anyone. Paul is stating that the Jews might worry that he is teaching that the law of Moses does not have any function at all because God makes people righteous by faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Do we make the law useless” or “Do we throw away the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:31	aj6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	διὰ τῆς πίστεως	1	See how you translated this phrase in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:31	pjgc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ γένοιτο! ἀλλὰ νόμον ἱστάνομεν	1	In these two sentences Paul responds to the rhetorical questions in the previous sentence.

Instead, we establish the law’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:31	rhy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	μὴ γένοιτο	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:6](../03/06.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
3:31	ppvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	νόμον ἱστάνομεν	1	Here, **we** is used exclusively to refer to Paul and other Christians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “we Christians uphold the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:31	c295		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	νόμον ἱστάνομεν	1	Paul uses **uphold** to refer to **the law** as if it were an object that people could hold up high. The meaning of **uphold** here is the opposite meaning of **nullify**, used earlier in the verse. It could mean: (1) Christians fulfill the requirements of the law by trusting in Jesus, who fulfilled the law for them. Alternate translation: “we fulfill the law by faith” (2) Christians value **the law** and affirm that it is useful. Alternative translation: “we confirm that the law is useful” or “we affirm that the law has value”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:intro	f9jc				0	# Romans 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)\n    * God’s righteousness is received through faith (3:21–26)\n    * No one can boast in works (3:27–31)\n    * The examples of Abraham and David (4:1–25)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [4:7–8](../04/07.md) of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The purpose of the law of Moses\n\nIn this chapter Paul continues to develop his argument based on what he wrote in the previous chapter. He explains how God made Abraham, the ancestor of all Jews, righteous a long time before God gave the law of Moses to the Jews. Even Abraham could not become righteous by what he did. Rather, God made Abraham righteous on the basis of Abraham’s faith. Obeying the law of Moses does not make a person righteous. People have always become righteous only by faith. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Circumcision\n\nCircumcision was important to the Israelites. It identified a person as a descendant of Abraham. It was also a sign of the covenant between Abraham and Yahweh. However, being circumcised never made anyone righteous. In this chapter Paul uses “circumcision” to refer to Jews and “uncircumcision” to refer to non-Jews. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nIn [4:1](../04/01.md), [3](../04/03.md), and [9–10](../04/09.md) Paul continues using rhetorical questions like he did in the previous chapter. He does this in order to answer objections that Jews might make about what he is saying.
4:1-12	q7wc				0	# Connecting Statement:\n\n[4:1–12](../04/01.md) are a series of rhetorical questions and answers that Paul uses to emphasize that even **Abraham**, the ancestor of the Jewish people, was made righteous by God “through faith.”
4:1	gxv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τί οὖν	1	Here, **then** indicates that what follows is a response to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [3:27–31](../03/27.md). See how you translated **What then** in [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:1	gw29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν, εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα?	1	In this verse Paul is not asking for information, but is using a question to express the objections that a Jew might have to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [3:27–31](../03/27.md). If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then we will say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, has surely discovered something!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:1	rhrp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν, εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα?	1	In this verse and the first part of the next verse, Paul is speaking as if he were a non-Christian Jew arguing against Paul. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:1	s4b5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐροῦμεν	1	In [4:1–9](../04/01.md) Paul uses **we** exclusively to speak of himself and other Jews. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “will we Jews say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:1	ot88		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	εὑρηκέναι Ἀβραὰμ τὸν προπάτορα ἡμῶν κατὰ σάρκα	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “that Abraham has discovered, who is our forefather according to the flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
4:1	fk5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ σάρκα	1	See how you translated **according to the flesh** in [1:3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:2	pmua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	εἰ γὰρ Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἔχει καύχημα	1	These clauses continue the the statements that an unbelieving Jew might make against Paul that began in the previous verse. You may need to indicate this with a closing quotation mark at the end of these clauses or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
4:2	ka9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that what follows is the reason for the statement in the previous verse. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “This must be the case because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:2	oe12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & Ἀβραὰμ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη, ἔχει καύχημα	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that the unbelieving Jew might think that this is actually true. In Paul’s time some Jewish teachers taught that Abraham had a right to boast because of his faith. However, since translating this as if it were true might confuse your readers, it is best to use a hypothetical sentence, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
4:2	wvmh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἀβραὰμ & ἐδικαιώθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God justified Abraham” or “God made Abraham right with himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:2	sibe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξ ἔργων	1	Paul assumes that his readers would understand that **works**means “works of the law” as in [3:28](../03/28.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “by doing what God requires from his people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	mefy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλ’ οὐ πρὸς Θεόν	1	In this clause Paul begins to respond to the rhetorical questions he wrote in the previous clauses and previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I would respond by saying, ‘But not before God!’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	me3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’ οὐ πρὸς Θεόν.	1	What follows the word **but** here is an emphatic contrast to what was just stated. Paul is negating the argument that he presented earlier in this verse and in the previous verse. You could make this emphasis explicit by replacing the period with an exclamation point or another natural way in your language for introducing am emphatic contrast. Alternate translation: “but certainly not before God!” or “however, not from God’s perspective!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:2	z9wx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸς Θεόν	1	Paul speaks of **Abraham** as if he were located in the presence of **God**. He means that Abraham could not **boast** to God about his **righteousness** if it was **righteous by works**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “from God’s perspective” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	w9i5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that what follows in this verse is the reason why Paul said in the previous verse that Abraham cannot boast “before God.” Use a natural way in your language to introduce a reason clause. Alternative translation: “This is true because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:3	hih3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί & ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει	1	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “the scripture surely says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:3	g1wz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τί & ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει	1	Here Paul uses **say** as if **the scripture** were a person who could speak. He means that the scripture he is about to quote contains information related to the topic he is discussing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what information is in the scripture” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
4:3	r9te		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	τί & ἡ Γραφὴ λέγει?	1	Here Paul uses **what does the scripture say** to indicate a quotation from an Old Testament book ([Genesis 15:6](gen/15/06.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “what is written in the scripture” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
4:3	xdtx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ Γραφὴ	1	Here, **the scripture** refers specifically to the quotation from [Genesis 15:6](../gen/15/06.md) that follows in this verse. It does not refer to the Scriptures in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the scripture that Moses wrote in Genesis” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:3	smc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God credited it to him as righteousness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:3	az65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐλογίσθη	1	The pronoun **it** refers to Abraham’s faith, which was implied by the statement that **Abraham believed God**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “his faith was credited” or “his trust in God was credited” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:3	qked		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in a different way. Alternate translation: “being righteous” or “being right with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:4	ihul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	**Now** here indicates that what follows in verses 4–5 is an explanation of the scripture quotation in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Certainly,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:4	oojx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τῷ & ἐργαζομένῳ	1	Here, **the one who works** refers to a hypothetical person who obeys the laws God gave through Moses and is “made righteous by works” (see [4:2](../04/02.md)). However, since the meaning of verses 4–5 is given in the next verse, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:4	dsl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ μισθὸς οὐ λογίζεται κατὰ χάριν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he does not consider his wage as grace” or “he does not regard his pay as grace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:4	xo4x			κατὰ χάριν & κατὰ ὀφείλημα	1	Alternate translation: “as a matter of grace … as a matter of obligation” or “as a gift … as an obligation”
4:4	ossx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ χάριν & κατὰ ὀφείλημα	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **grace** and **obligation**, you could express the same ideas with different forms. Alternate translation: “as what is gracious … as what is owed” or “as something gifted … as something owed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:5	ynp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	**Now** here indicates that what follows in this verse is in contrast to what Paul said in the previous verse.

4:5	fezj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν δικαιοῦντα	1	Here, **the one who justifies** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “God who justifies” or “God who makes righteous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	tovp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸν ἀσεβῆ	1	Paul is using the singular adjective phrase **the ungodly** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. If your language does not use adjectives in the same way, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are ungodly” or “people who do ungodly things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
4:5	va3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λογίζεται ἡ πίστις αὐτοῦ εἰς δικαιοσύνην	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who does the action, Paul implies that “God” does it. See how you translated a similar phrase in [4:3](../04/03.md). Alternate translation: “God credited his faith as righteousness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:5	s00l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις αὐτοῦ εἰς δικαιοσύνην	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **faith** and **righteousness**, you could express the same ideas with different forms. Alternate translation: “how he trusts … as being righteous” or “how he trusts in God … as being right with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:6	hil6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	καὶ Δαυεὶδ λέγει	1	Paul uses **David also speaks of** here to introduce a scripture quotation from [Psalm 31:1–2](../psa/031/001.md), which David wrote. This occurs in [4:7–8](../04/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Paul is quoting from the Old Testament. Alternate translation: “David also wrote in the Old Testament of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
4:6	s0v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸν μακαρισμὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **blessedness**, you could express the same idea with a different form. Alternate translation: “how blessed the man is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:6	vyse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν μακαρισμὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe **the man** that is characterized by **blessedness**.

4:6	x40j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	Paul is speaking of people in general, not of one particular **man**.

4:24	ffdm			δι’ ἡμᾶς	1	See how you translated “for his sake” in the previous verse.
4:24	nh4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἷς μέλλει λογίζεσθαι	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who will do the action, Paul implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “to whom God is about to credit it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:24	bu1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	μέλλει	1	Here the pronoun **it** refers to the “faith” mentioned in [4:5](../04/05) and [4:20](../04/20). Previously **it** referred to Abraham’s faith, but in this verse **it** refers to **our** faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “our faith is about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

4:24	artt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἐγείραντα Ἰησοῦν, τὸν Κύριον ἡμῶν, ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	This clause refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “God who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead ones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:24	i6vl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐγείραντα Ἰησοῦν, τὸν Κύριον ἡμῶν	1	Here, **raised** is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who caused Jesus our Lord to live again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:24	iq69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Here, the phrase translated **the dead ones** refers to dead people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the place where dead people are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:25	irue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃς & ἡμῶν & τὴν δικαίωσιν ἡμῶν	1	Here the pronoun **who** refers to Jesus, and **our** refers to all “those who believe” in him, as mentioned in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus … we believers’ … the justification of us believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:25	cca1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς παρεδόθη & ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “whom God gave up … God raised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:25	b999		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὃς παρεδόθη	1	Paul speaks of Jesus as if he were a thing that could be **given up** to another person. Paul means that God allowed people to arrest and kill Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “who was allowed to be killed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:25	op41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τὰ παραπτώματα ἡμῶν & διὰ τὴν δικαίωσιν ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for these ideas of **trespasses** and **justification**, you could express the same ideas with verbal forms. Alternate translation: “because we trespassed … to make us righteous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:25	imvc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τὰ παραπτώματα ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul uses **for the sake of** differently than he did in [4:23–24](../04/23.md). Here Paul uses this phrase to indicate the reason why Jesus **was given up**. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “because of our trespasses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

5:intro	i1dt				0	# Romans 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Righteousness is received through Jesus Christ by trusting in him (3:21–5:21)\n    * God’s righteousness is received through faith (3:21–26)\n    * No one can boast in works (3:27–31)\n    * The examples of Abraham and David (4:1–25)\n    * The blessings of justification (5:1–11)\n    * Adam and Christ are compared (5:12–5:21)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The second Adam\n\nAdam was the first man. He was created by God and called the first “son” of God. He brought sin and death into the world by eating the forbidden fruit. In this chapter Paul describes Jesus as the “second Adam” and the true son of God. Jesus brings eternal life and overcame sin and death by dying on the cross. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Inclusive language\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we”, “us”, and “our” refer inclusively to all believers in Christ. Paul calls these people those who have been “justified by faith” in [5:1](../05/01.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:1	age4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	The word **Therefore** here marks a new section of the letter. It also introduces a result clause that summarizes the blessed results of a person becoming righteous by trusting in Jesus, which Paul just discussed in [1:18](../01/18.md)–[4:25](../04/25.md). Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “Since all these things are true” or “As a result of everything that I have just told you being true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:1	xmp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	δικαιωθέντες & ἐκ πίστεως, εἰρήνην ἔχωμεν πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν, διὰ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “let us have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, because we have been justified by faith” or “we can have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, since we have been justified by faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:1	xott		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δικαιωθέντες	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “because God makes us righteous” or “since God makes us right with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:1	wbwx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ πίστεως	1	See how you translated this phrase in [4:16](../04/16.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:1	ldru		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	εἰρήνην ἔχωμεν	1	Some ancient copies say “we have peace,” which makes sense, since [5:1–5](../05/01.md) are a list of blessings that belong to those people who have been **justified by faith**. If the reading **let us have peace** is correct, this phrase may be indicating Paul’s desire that his fellow believers continue to experience the peace they have with God. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the readings of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
5:1	kjpb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἔχωμεν	1	Paul uses the phrase **let us have peace** to exhort his Christian readers to continue living peacefully with God. It is not a command. This phrase does not imply that those who have been **justified by faith** do not yet have peace with God. Use a form in your language that communicates an exhortation. Alternate translation: “we must continue to have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:1	hi12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰρήνην ἔχωμεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:1	o2yr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰρήνην ἔχωμεν	1	Paul speaks of these people as if they could possess or own **peace**. He means that they can live peacefully with God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “let us live in a peaceful manner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:1	s6xd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἔχωμεν & ἡμῶν	1	Here and throughout this chapter, **us** and **our** inclusively refer to all those **having been justified by faith** in Jesus. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “let us believers have … our” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:1	xaeg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, **through** indicates that **our Lord Jesus Christ** is the means by which believers have **peace with God**. This refers to what Jesus did for believers in order for them to have **peace with God**, as briefly mentioned in [4:25](../04/25.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “through what our Lord Jesus Christ did for us” or “which was caused by our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:2	slyh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δι’ οὗ καὶ τὴν προσαγωγὴν ἐσχήκαμεν, τῇ πίστει εἰς τὴν χάριν ταύτην, ἐν ᾗ ἑστήκαμεν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **access**, **faith**, or **grace**, you could express the same ideas another way. Alternate translation: “through whom we also access and stand in how gracious God is by trusting in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:2	tsbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗ	1	The pronoun **whom** refers to “our Lord Jesus Christ,” as mentioned in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:2	i50u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	καὶ & ἐσχήκαμεν & ἑστήκαμεν & καυχώμεθα	1	The pronoun **we** in this verse refers inclusively to all believers in Christ. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “we believers also have … we believers stand … we believers boast” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:2	af0n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς τὴν χάριν ταύτην, ἐν ᾗ ἑστήκαμεν	1	Paul speaks of **grace** as if it were a location that someone could access and stand within. He means that trusting in Jesus allows believers to confidently experience how gracious God is toward his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “to confidently experience how kind God is” or “to safely experience how gracious God is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:2	dxcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καυχώμεθα ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **hope** and **glory**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “we may boast because we are confident that we will be glorified with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:2	zp5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul is using possessive forms to describe how **glory** relates to **God**. This could refer to: (1) the glory that God shares with believers. This was the same glory that God shared with humans when he created them, but which they lost when the first humans sinned, as mentioned in [3:23](../03/23.md). Alternate translation: “of sharing in the glory God has” or “of the glory from God” (2) glorifying God, as in the similar phrase “the glory of the imperishable God” in [1:23](../01/23.md). Alternate translation: “of glorifying God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:3	q5p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐ μόνον δέ	1	The pronoun **this** here refers to boasting about “the hope of the glory of God,” as mentioned in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “And we not only boast on the basis of the hope of the glory of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:3	c644		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ καυχώμεθα ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν	1	Here, **in our sufferings** could mean: (1) believers can **boast** about their **sufferings**. Alternate translation: “we can also boast about our sufferings” (2) believers can boast while they are experiencing **sufferings**. Alternate translation: “we can also boast when we are distressed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:3	xeak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδότες	1	Here, **knowing** indicates that what follows in this verse and the next verse are the reasons why believers can **boast in our sufferings**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing reasons. Alternate translation: “since we know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:3	c0rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ταῖς θλίψεσιν & ἡ θλῖψις & ὑπομονὴν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **sufferings**, **suffering**, and **endurance**, you could express the same ideas with verbal forms. Alternate translation: “when we suffer … when we suffer, it … a way to endure” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:3	lo57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ θλῖψις ὑπομονὴν κατεργάζεται	1	Paul speaks of **endurance** as if it were an object that could be produced. He means that when Christians trust in God while **suffering**, they develop greater **endurance** than they had before experiencing **suffering**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “this suffering helps us know how to endure” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	w7c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἡ δὲ ὑπομονὴ δοκιμήν, ἡ δὲ δοκιμὴ ἐλπίδα	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “and endurance produces character, and this character produces hope” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:4	dt8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ & ὑπομονὴ	1	See how you translated **endurance** in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:4	gjvh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δοκιμήν, ἡ δὲ δοκιμὴ	1	The word translated **character** refers specifically to the mental and moral qualities of someone who has been approved by God because they have successfully endured testing. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **character**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “qualities of which God approves, and the approved qualities” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:4	eh9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐλπίδα	1	See how you translated **hope** in [5:2](../05/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:5	u4xh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἡ δὲ ἐλπὶς οὐ καταισχύνει, ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκκέχυται ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, τοῦ δοθέντος ἡμῖν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes. Alternate translation: “And because the love of God has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us, that hope does not disappoint” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:5	rctz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ δὲ ἐλπὶς	1	Here, **that hope** refers to "the hope of the glory of God" in [5:2](../05/02.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “And being confident in God’s glory” or “And the hope of the glory of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:5	qka8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅτι ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκκέχυται ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, τοῦ δοθέντος ἡμῖν	1	Paul speaks of **love** as if it were something that could be **poured** out of a container, and he speaks figurative of **our hearts** as though they were containers that could be filled. He means that the Holy Spirit has completely revealed to God’s people how much God loves them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “because the Holy Spirit, who was given to us, has deeply revealed how much God loves his people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:5	dc95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐκκέχυται ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, τοῦ δοθέντος ἡμῖν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit, whom God gave us, has poured the love of God into our hearts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:5	clmb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe how **love** relates to **God**. Here, **the love of God** could refer to: (1) God’s love for us. Alternate translation: “God’s love” or “God’s love for us” (2) our love for God. Alternate translation: “our love for God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:5	glt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ἡμῶν	1	See how you translated this word in [1:21](../01/21.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:6	x5eg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that what follows in [5:6–8](../05/06.md) explains “the love of God” in [5:5](../05/05.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:6	a7s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἔτι & ὄντων ἡμῶν ἀσθενῶν	1	In this clause Paul is describing something that was true during the time period he is describing in the rest of the verse. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “during the time we were still being weak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
5:6	xqr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔτι & ὄντων ἡμῶν ἀσθενῶν	1	Here, **weak** means that people are completely unable to make themselves righteous. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly.

5:7	o92c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	**For** indicates that what follows this word explains what came before it. Here,**For** introduces an explanation, by contrast, of how surprising it is that Christ would die on behalf of ungodly sinners, as stated in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different expression, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:7	h089		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	μόλις γὰρ & τις ἀποθανεῖται & γὰρ & τάχα τις	1	Paul uses **someone** twice in this verse in two hypothetical situations. He does this to help his readers recognize how rare it is for someone to voluntarily die on behalf of another person. Use the natural form in your language for expressing hypothetical situations. Alternate translation: “Let us consider how rare it would be for someone to die … Let us, though, suppose that perhaps someone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
5:7	x60d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	γὰρ & τάχα τις	2	What follows the word **though** here is in contrast to what Paul stated in the previous sentence. Although **someone will hardly die** for **a righteous person**, **someone** might possibly be willing to die for a **good person**. Although Paul does not state the difference between **a righteous person** and **a good person**, he contrasts both examples to emphasize how unlikely it is for a person to willingly die on behalf of another person. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “By contrast, perhaps someone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:7	mqyq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ τολμᾷ ἀποθανεῖν	1	Paul speaks of dying as if it were a **dare** or challenge for **someone** to overcome. He means that **someone** would be brave enough to give their life for the sake of someone else. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “might even be willing to die” or “would even be brave enough to die” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:8	qh0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἑαυτοῦ	1	Paul uses the word **his own** to emphasize how much **God** loves his people. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “his very own” or “his personal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
5:8	vh6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ἀγάπην εἰς ἡμᾶς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **love**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “how much God loves us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:8	c8vd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἔτι ἁμαρτωλῶν ὄντων ἡμῶν	1	In this clause Paul is describing something that was true during the time period he is describing in the rest of the verse. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “during the time we were still being sinners” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
5:8	fel5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἔτι ἁμαρτωλῶν ὄντων ἡμῶν, Χριστὸς ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἀπέθανεν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases.

5:9	vnxd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πολλῷ οὖν μᾶλλον	1	Here, **then** indicates that what follows is the result of what Paul described in [5:6–8](../05/06.md). Use a natural way in your language for indicating result. Alternate translation: “Much more, therefore” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:9	tewt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	πολλῷ οὖν μᾶλλον	1	**Much more then** here strongly emphasizes that what follows is another important result of what Christ did for us. Use a natural way in your language to express strong emphasis. Alternate translation: “It is then much more certain that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:9	zp4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	δικαιωθέντες νῦν ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ	1	This clause states the reason why **we** can be **much more** certain that **we will be saved**. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “because we have now been justified by his blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:9	x9yi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δικαιωθέντες νῦν ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express these ideas with active forms or in other ways that are natural in your language. Alternate translation: “his blood having now justified us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:9	nvs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ	1	See how you translated **his blood** in [3:25](../03/25.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
5:9	jbaz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σωθησόμεθα δι’ αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express these ideas with active forms or in other ways that are natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will save us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

6:intro	v522				0	# Romans 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)\n    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)\n    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Slavery\n\nIn this chapter Paul frequently uses the metaphor of the relationship between slaves and their masters. He speaks figuratively of people who live sinfully as if they were slaves to sin and the death it causes ([6:6](../06/06.md), [16–17](../06/16.md), [20](../06/20.md)). He also speaks figuratively of Christians as if God has freed them from being enslaved to sin and has himself or righteousness as their master ([6:18](../06/18.md), [22](../06/22.md)). Because Christians are no longer controlled by their desire to sin, they should instead serve God and live in a way that glorifies him ([6:12–14](../06/12.md), [19](../06/19.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/servant]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nIn [6:1–3](../06/01.md), [15–16](../06/15.md), and [21](../06/21.md) Paul uses rhetorical questions in order to answer objections that people might make about what he is saying.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Inclusive language\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we”, “us”, and “our” refer inclusively to all believers in Christ. Paul calls these people those who have been “baptized into Christ Jesus” in [6:3](../06/03.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:1	fxgw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τί οὖν	1	Here, **then** indicates that what follows is a response to what Paul said in the previous chapter, especially what he said in [5:20](../05/20.md).

If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation or communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Then we will say that we should continue in the sin so that the grace might increase!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:1	t8tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τί οὖν ἐροῦμεν? ἐπιμένωμεν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ, ἵνα ἡ χάρις πλεονάσῃ?	1	In this verse and the first part of the next verse, Paul is speaking as if he were a Christian who misunderstood what Paul had taught in the previous chapter.

6:1	ju6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα ἡ χάρις πλεονάσῃ	1	Paul speaks here of **grace** as if it were an object that could **increase** in amount, as he also does in [5:20](../05/20.md).

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We who died to sin surely cannot still live in it!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Here, **died to sin** refers to the idea that Christians are no longer controlled by their sinful desires. By contrast, **live in** sin means to continue being controlled by sinful desires. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “We who are no longer controlled by our desire to sin, how could we still live as though we are controlled by that desire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You surely know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:3	wh26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὅσοι	1	Paul is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

6:4	f4va		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνετάφημεν οὖν αὐτῷ	1	Paul speaks of Christians as if they **were buried** with Jesus when they were baptized. Paul mentions burial because it emphasizes that Jesus did indeed die. Here he means that Christians are indeed united with Christ’s **death** and share in its spiritual benefits. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly.

7:intro	fl1y				0	# Romans 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)\n    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)\n    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)\n    * Christians have been freed from the law (7:1–6)\n    * The law is not sinful (7:7–12)\n    * Christians still struggle with indwelling sin (7:13–25)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “The Law”\n\nThroughout most of this chapter Paul uses the singular noun “the law” to refer to the group of laws that God gave Israel through Moses. However, in [7:21–25](../07/21.md) Paul uses the word “law” in several different ways. Each of these different uses will be addressed in the notes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Marriage\n\nScripture commonly uses marriage as a metaphor. Here Paul uses it to describe how the church relates to the law of Moses and now to Christ. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Inclusive language\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we”, “us”, and “our” refer inclusively to all Jewish believers in Christ. Paul calls these people “brothers” in [7:1](../07/01.md) and [7:4](../07/04.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
7:1	mk7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ ἀγνοεῖτε, ἀδελφοί (γινώσκουσιν γὰρ νόμον λαλῶ), ὅτι ὁ νόμος κυριεύει τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ἐφ’ ὅσον χρόνον ζῇ?	1	Paul is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that the Jew is required to obey the law of Moses his whole life. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You surely know, brothers (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is lord of the man for as long as he lives!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:1	guk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here to refer to both male and female Jewish believers in Christ. Alternate translation: “my fellow Jewish Christians” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
7:1	s4su			(γινώσκουσιν γὰρ νόμον λαλῶ)	1	Here Paul interrupts himself in order to clarify that he is specifically directing this part of the letter to the Jewish believers in the church at Rome. If this would be confusing in your language, you could add parentheses, as done in the ULT, or use a natural way in your language to indicate this.
7:1	j67x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **for** indicates that what follows this word explains what came before it. Here, it explains the reason why Paul expects these **brothers** to understand what he is saying. Use a natural way in your language for indicating a reason. Alternate translation: “I know you should understand this because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:1	ajk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λαλῶ	1	The pronoun **I** here and throughout this chapter refers to Paul (see [6:19](../06/19.md)).

7:1	okz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὁ νόμος κυριεύει τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Paul speaks of **the law** as if it were a king. Paul means that, like a king, **the law** must be obeyed by those who are obligated to do so. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or with a simile. Alternate translation: “like a king, the law must be obeyed by every Jewish person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:1	r9fl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀνθρώπου & ζῇ	1	Although **the man** and **he** are masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “of a person … that person lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
7:2	as1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	**For** indicates that what follows this word explains what came before it. Here, it introduces an explanation of an example from God’s law that illustrates how “the law rules over the man for as long as he lives,” as Paul said in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “For example,” or “As an illustration,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural phrase.

7:2	hpn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ & ὕπανδρος γυνὴ & δέδεται νόμῳ & κατήργηται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the law continually binds the married woman … God releases her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:2	l6d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ & ὕπανδρος γυνὴ τῷ ζῶντι ἀνδρὶ δέδεται νόμῳ & κατήργηται ἀπὸ τοῦ νόμου τοῦ ἀνδρός	1	Here Paul speaks of the **law** as if it were a person who could tie a **woman** to her **husband**. Paul means that the **law** of Moses requires a **married woman** to stay married to her **husband** only while he is alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God requires in his law that the married woman remain married to her living husband … she is no longer required to remain married to the husband” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:2	ag23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ νόμου τοῦ ἀνδρός	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe **the law** that is related to **the husband**.

Alternate translation: “if she becomes married to another husband, the first husband being alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
7:3	jbvc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ζῶντος τοῦ ἀνδρὸς	1	In this clause Paul is describing something that was occurring during the same time period as what he describes in the next clause. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “at the same time that the husband is alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])

Paul means that **the law** that prohibited a woman from marrying **another husband** did not apply if her first husband died.

Alternate translation: “she is no longer required to remain married to the first husband” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Just as dead people don’t have to obey the law, so too, Jewish Christians no longer have to obey it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile.

8:intro	ev4r				0	# Romans 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Becoming like Christ in this life (6:1–8:39)\n    * Baptism represents union with Christ’s death (6:1–14)\n    * Christians are now slaves of righteousness (6:15–23)\n    * Christians have been freed from the law (7:1–6)\n    * The law is not sinful (7:7–12)\n    * Christians still struggle with indwelling sin (7:13–25)\n    * The Holy Spirit dwells in Christians (8:1–27)\n    * Christians have confidence in God’s love (8:28–8:39)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [8:36](../08/36.md). Paul quotes these words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Indwelling of the Spirit\n\nIn [8:9–17](../08/09.md) and [26–27](../08/26.md) Paul says that the Holy Spirit dwells inside Christians to help them stop sinning and to intercede for them. The presence of the Holy Spirit within a person indicates that that person is a genuine Christian. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n### Predestination\n\nMany scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” See the use of the word “predestined” in [8:28–30](../08/28.md) and “elect” in [8:33](../08/33.md). Some scholars take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating these verses. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]])\n\n## Important Figure of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [8:24](../08/24.md) and [8:31–35](../08/31.md) Paul uses rhetorical questions in order to emphasize that what he is saying is true. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Flesh\n\nPaul uses the word “flesh” in a variety of ways throughout this letter. In this chapter he frequently uses it to refer to sinful human nature. However, he uses the word “flesh” to refer to Christ’s physical body in [8:3](../08/03.md). Every use of the word “flesh” will be discussed in the notes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])\n\n### Inclusive language\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we”, “us”, and “our” refer inclusively to all believers in Christ. Paul calls these people “brothers” in [8:12](../08/12.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
8:1	xq2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐδὲν ἄρα νῦν κατάκριμα	1	Here, **therefore now** marks the beginning of a new section in the letter.

Alternate translation: “the principle that is my sinful nature that leads to death” (2) the laws God gave the Jews, which Paul previously said in [7:5](../07/05.md) stimulate people to sin more.

9:intro	w6f4				0	# Romans 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)\n    * Paul’s sorrow for Israel’s unbelief (9:1–5)\n    * God chooses whom he wants to choose (9:6–13)\n    * God shows mercy on whom he wants to show mercy (9:14–18)\n    * No one can question God’s choice (9:19–33)\n\nChapter 9 begins a new topic in this letter. In chapters 9-11, Paul focuses on the nation of Israel.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [9:25-29](../09/25.md) and [33](../09/33.md) of this chapter. Paul quotes all of these words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Predestination\n\nMany scholars believe that in this chapter Paul teaches extensively on a subject known as “predestination.” Some take this to indicate that God has chosen to save some people from before the world existed. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n### Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Stone of stumbling\n\nIn [9:30–33](../09/30.md) Paul explains that God made some Gentiles righteous because they believed in Jesus, but most Jews rejected Jesus because they were trying to obey the law of Moses to become righteous. Paul quotes [Isaiah 8:14](../../isa/08/14.md) and [28:16](../../isa/28/16.md) to describe Jesus as if he were a stone that the Jews trip over when walking. See the translations and notes for how Peter uses these same verses from Isaiah in [1 Peter 2:6](../1pe/02/06.md), [8](../1pe/02/08.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:1	yg93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἀλήθειαν λέγω ἐν Χριστῷ, οὐ ψεύδομαι	1	These two expressions mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize that he is telling the truth.

9:2	jky1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	λύπη & μεγάλη, καὶ ἀδιάλειπτος ὀδύνη	1	These two expressions mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize how intense his emotions are.

God’s plan for Israel (9:1–11:36)\n    * Paul’s sorrow for Israel’s unbelief (9:1–5)\n    * God chooses whom he wants to choose (9:6–13)\n    * God shows mercy on whom he wants to show mercy (9:14–18)\n    * No one can question God’s choice (9:19–33)\n    * Israel’s false righteousness (10:1–4)\n    * Salvation is available to everyone (10:5–21)\n    * Israel has a faithful remnant (11:1–10)\n    * Israel’s unbelief resulted in non-Jews’ belief (11:11–24)\n    * God will save Israel (11:15–32)\n    * Praise for God’s wisdom (11:33–11:36)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [11:9–10](../11/09.md), [26–27](../11/26.md), and [34–35](../11/34.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Grafting\n\nIn [11:17–24](../11/17.md) Paul uses the image of “grafting” to refer to the place of the Gentiles and Jews in the plans of God. Permanently attaching a branch from one plant onto another plant is called “grafting.” Paul uses the picture of God grafting the Gentiles into his people as a wild branch is grafted into a cultivated olive tree. But God has not forgotten about the Jews, who are spoken of as a natural part of the tree. God will also save Jews who believe in Jesus and they will rejoin God’s people.

He is also speaking of the Israelites who descended from those men, as if they were a **lump of dough** that was made from the **firstfruits** that had been harvested.

The **olive tree** represents God’s people. The **branches** that **were broken off** represent Jews who don’t believe in Jesus. The **wild olive branch** represents non-Jewish people who believe in Jesus. The **richness** represents the blessings God gives his people. The **root** represents either the ancestors of the Israelites (as in the previous verse) or the Jewish people in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor as a simile. See also the discussion of this metaphor in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “if some of the Jews were rejected, like branches are broken off of a tree, and you, being foreigners were joined to God’s people as wild olive branches are grafted onto a tree, and you received the blessings of the first Israelites as part of God’s people, as branches receive the nutrients of the root of the olive tree” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

The context of chapters 9–11 indicates that God did the action.

11:17	qv65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σὺ	1	Even though Paul is writing to a group of people, non-Jewish Christians, **you** is singular throughout this verse.

11:17	z6hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς & συνκοινωνὸς	1	In this verse **them** refers to the Jewish people who believe in Jesus.

11:18	gqd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	μὴ κατακαυχῶ τῶν κλάδων. εἰ δὲ κατακαυχᾶσαι, οὐ σὺ τὴν ῥίζαν βαστάζεις, ἀλλὰ ἡ ῥίζα σέ	1	Paul continues using the metaphor of a tree from the previous two verses. Here, **branches** represents those Jews whom God rejected because they did not believe in Jesus. The **root** represents either the ancestors of the Israelites (like in [11:16](../11/16.md)) or the Jewish people in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this metaphor as a simile. See also the discussion of this metaphor in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “do not boast over the unbelieving Jews whom God rejected, like branches were broken off of a tree. But if you boast, you yourself do not sustain Gods people, like branches cannot sustain the root, but the first Israelites sustain you, like the root sustains the branches” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])

13:intro	l4q7				0	# Romans 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Instructions for living as Christians (12:1–15:13)\n    * How to act toward God (12:1–2)\n    * How to serve the church (12:3–8)\n    * How to act toward other Christians (12:9–13)\n    * How to act toward unbelievers (12:14–21)\n    * How to act toward government (13:1–7)\n    * How to act toward other people (13:8–10)\n    * Act as if the end is near (13:11–14)\n\n## Special Concepts in this chapter\n\n### Submission to rulers\n\nIn [13:1–7](../13/01.md) Paul commands his readers to obey rulers and pay taxes. Some readers will find this difficult to accept, especially if they live in places where wicked rulers persecute the church. It is important to recognize that the Holy Spirit led Paul to write these words while the Roman government was persecuting Christians. Christians must obey their rulers as well as obey God. The only time a Christian should disobey governing authorities is when those rulers do not allow Christians to do something God explicitly commands them to do (for an example of such a situation, see [Acts 5:28–29](../act/05/28.md)).\n\n### “The night advanced, and the day has come near”\n\nIn [13:11–14](../13/11.md) Paul tells his readers that they should behave like Jesus because Jesus is coming back soon. He calls the current time in which people do what is evil the “night,” and he calls the time when Jesus returns the “day.”

13:13	wd5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κώμοις & μέθαις & κοίταις & ἀσελγείαις & ἔριδι & ζήλῳ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **celebrations**, **drunkenness**, **immorality**, **lust**, **strife**, and **jealousy**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “in being drunk while celebrating … being drunk … in acting sexually immorally … lusting uncontrollably … in quarreling with others … being jealous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:13	qes3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κοίταις καὶ ἀσελγείαις	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize all kinds of sexual sins. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “in every kind of sexually immoral act” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
13:14	emp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	**But** here indicates that what follows is in strong contrast to what was said in the previous verse. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a strong contrast. Alternate translation: “Instead of doing those things,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
13:14	sir6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνδύσασθε τὸν Κύριον Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν	1	Paul speaks of **Christ** as if he were clothing that someone could **put on**.

Alternate translation: “do not think ahead with regard to what the flesh desires” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
13:14	xre7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῆς σαρκὸς	1	Here Paul uses **flesh** figuratively to refer to sinful human nature. See how you translated a similar use of **flesh** in [7:18](../07/18.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
14:intro	kt8c				0	# Romans 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Instructions for living as Christians (12:1–15:13)\n    * How to act toward God (12:1–2)\n    * How to serve the church (12:3–8)\n    * How to act toward other Christians (12:9–13)\n    * How to act toward unbelievers (12:14–21)\n    * How to act toward government (13:1–7)\n    * How to act toward other people (13:8–10)\n    * Act as if the end is near (13:11–14)\n    * Do not judge other Christians (14:1–12)\n    * Do not tempt other Christians to sin (14:13–23)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [14:11](../14/11.md) of this chapter, which Paul quotes from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Weak in faith\n\nPaul teaches that Christians can have real faith, and yet at the same time be “weak in faith” regarding some situations. This describes Christians whose faith is immature and who feel guilty about doing certain things that God did not forbid. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Dietary restrictions\n\nIn the law of Moses, God forbade the Jews from eating the meat of some animals which God said were unclean. However, since Christians have been “made dead to the law” ([7:4](../07/04.md)), they are free to eat what they want. The Roman church to which Paul wrote this letter was made up of both Jews and Gentiles. Some of the Jewish believers were offended by the non-Jewish believers eating foods that God had previously forbidden in the law of Moses. The non-Jewish believers were also judging the Jewish believers for not eating those foods. Paul uses this situation to teach that Christians must use their freedom in a way that honors the Lord and shows love to other believers. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Inclusive language\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we” and “us” refer inclusively to all believers in Christ. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
14:1	jf8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀσθενοῦντα τῇ πίστει	1	Here, **weak in the faith** refers to someone who does not have a mature **faith**, but feels guilty about doing certain things that God did not forbid. The word **weak** here does not refer to physical weakness. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter.

14:1	i45s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	μὴ εἰς διακρίσεις διαλογισμῶν	1	Here, **for** indicates that this clause is a purpose clause.

14:2	tuf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὃς	1	**One person** here does not refer to one particular person.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Let the one who eats any type of food not despise the one who does not eat every type of food, and let the one who does not eat every type of food not judge the one who eats every type of food” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
14:3	pqrp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ Θεὸς & αὐτὸν προσελάβετο	1	Although the pronoun **him** is singular, here it refers to both **the one eating** and **the one not eating**.

14:4	xq7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σὺ	1	Even though Paul is writing to a group of people, **you** here is singular.

14:4	vaym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀλλότριον οἰκέτην	1	Paul speaks of any Christian as if he were a **household slave** who belongs **to another**.

Alternate translation: “He pleases or does not please his own master. But he will be made to please God, for the Lord is able to make him be pleasing” (2) **stands** and **stand** refer to being accepted by God at the final judgment, and **falls** refers to being condemned by God at the final judgment.

Conclusion (15:14–16:27)\n    * Paul describes his mission (15:14–21)\n    * Paul’s travel plans (15:22–33)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with [15:9–11](../15/09.md) and [21](../15/21.md) of this chapter, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\nSome translations set prose quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words in [15:12](../15/12.md).\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Able and unable\n\nIn [15:1–6](../15/01.md) Paul concludes his teaching from Chapter 14 about how Christians with different degrees of spiritual maturity should act toward each other. He refers to some Christians as those who are “weak in faith” ([14:1](../14/01.md)) or “unable” ([15:1](../15/01.md)). These phrases describe Christians who have immature faith and feel guilty about doing certain things that God did not forbid. By contrast, he refers to spiritually mature Christians as those who are “able” ([15:1](../15/01.md)). Paul teaches that those who are strong in faith need to help those who are weak in faith and neither should judge the other. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Forms of ‘You’\n\nIn this chapter, with three exceptions, the words “you” and “your” are plural and refer to Paul’s Christian readers, whom he calls “brothers” in [15:14](../15/14.md) and [15:30](../15/30.md).

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Inclusive language\n\nIn this chapter the pronouns “we,” “us,” “our,” and “ourselves” refer inclusively to Paul’s Christian readers. Paul calls these people “brothers” in [15:14](../15/14.md) and [15:30](../15/30.md). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

16:intro	qy96				0	# Romans 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n8. Conclusion (15:14–16:27)\n    * Paul describes his mission (15:14–21)\n    * Paul’s travel plans (15:22–33)\n    * Paul commends Phoebe (16:1–2)\n    * Paul greets Christians in Rome (16:3–16)\n    * Paul warns against false teachers (16:17–20)\n    * Paul greets more Christians in Rome (16:21–24)\n    * Doxology (16:25–27)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Letter writing and sending\n\nIn this culture, someone who wanted to send a letter often spoke what they wanted to say, and a scribe would write it down for them. Then, they would send the letter with a messenger, who would read the letter to the person or people to whom it was addressed. In this chapter, Tertius mentions that he is the scribe writing the letter for Paul ([16:22](../16/22.md)). Paul begins this chapter by recommending Phoebe to the believers in Rome who receive this letter. This could indicate that Phoebe was the messenger who delivered the letter to them.\n\n### Greetings\n\nIn this culture, it was common for those who sent letters to include greetings to and from others in their letters. In this way, many people could greet each other but only send one letter. In [16:3–16](../16/03.md) and [21–23](../16/21.md) Paul includes greetings to and from people whom he and the Romans knew. Express these greetings in a natural form in your language.

Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “I enthusiastically ask to be remembered to” or “I send regards to”
16:3	xigr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἀσπάσασθε	1	**Greet** here and throughout [16:3–16](../16/03.md) is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this verse as its own sentence and repeat the main verb of the previous verse in the next verse, as in the UST.

16:4	fye8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸν ἑαυτῶν τράχηλον ὑπέθηκαν	1	This phrase refers to doing something that would put someone in danger of being executed.

Alternate translation: “of this concealed message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
