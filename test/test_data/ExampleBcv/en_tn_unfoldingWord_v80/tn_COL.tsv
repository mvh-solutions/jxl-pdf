Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee, and he persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. However, he had never met the Colossians in person (see [2:1](../02/01.md)).\n\nPaul wrote this letter while in prison ([4:3](../04/03.md); [4:18](../04/18.md)). Paul was imprisoned many times, and he does not say where he is. Many scholars think he is in Rome.\n\n### What is the book of Colossians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the believers in city of Colossae, which is in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). When he heard from Epaphras about the believers in Colossae, he wrote to encourage them and to warn them against false teachers. These false teachers were telling people that they had to obey certain rules and know certain things to receive new life, and they boasted about their own power and experiences. Paul attacks this false teaching by showing the Colossians that Christ’s work accomplishes everything that they need and gives them new life. When they are united to Christ, they do not need anything else, including this false teaching.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Colossians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Colossae” or “A Letter to the Christians in Colossae.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Who were the false teachers that Paul warns the Colossians against?\n\nMost likely, these false teachers were not part of one specific group or belief system. They probably believed and practiced things from several different belief systems. Because of this, it is hard to describe exactly what they believed and taught. Based on what Paul says about them, they had certain rules about food and drink, the rituals of special days and behavior. They had what Paul calls a “philosophy,” or a system of thinking about the world that they thought was sophisticated. It seems that they based at least some of these beliefs and rules on visions and marvelous experiences that probably included what they believed were encounters with angels. Paul argues that the people who hold to these views are not remaining faithful to Christ, and he wants the Colossians to focus on the work of Christ for them, which has accomplished everything this false teaching claims to do and more.\n\n### What does Paul mean when he uses language for “heaven”?\n\nPaul speaks of heaven as “above,” and he further defines it as the place where Christ is seated at God’s right hand and where blessings are stored up for believers. Most likely, the spiritual powers are also in heaven. When Paul tells the Colossians to focus on what is “above” ([3:1](../03/01.md)), that is not because heaven is good and earth is bad. Instead, it is because heaven is where Christ is, as he states in the same verse. The Colossians are supposed to focus on Christ and where he is.\n\n### What are the spiritual powers that Paul speaks about?\n\nPaul speaks of thrones, dominions, governments, and authorities in [1:16](../01/16.md), and he uses some of these words again in [2:10](../02/10.md); [2:15](../02/15.md). These words refer to people or things that have power and authority, and in the letter to the Colossians they probably refer more specifically to powerful spiritual beings. The “elemental principles” in [2:8](../02/08.md); [2:20](../02/20.md) probably refer to the same kind of beings in a generic way. Paul never specifically says that these spiritual powers are evil, but he does say that Christ’s work frees the Colossians from them. Obeying these powers and focusing on them is thus opposed to the new life that Christ has given.\n\n### Who are all the people that Paul mentions in the letter?\n\nMost of the people who are mentioned at the end of the letter are either with Paul or are people that Paul knows in or near the city of Colossae. Epaphras is mentioned several times, since he is the one who first preached the good news to the Colossians and the one who told Paul about them. Tychicus and Onesimus are the ones who traveled from Paul to Colossae with the letter, and they are able to give more updates about Paul and the people with him.\n\n### Why does Paul mention other towns in this letter?\n\nPaul mentions Laodicea and Hierapolis because they are towns nearby in the same valley. If a person stood in Colossae, he or she could see Laodicea at the edge of the valley. Paul mentions these three towns (Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis) because they were towns where Epaphras preached the good news, and Paul had never met any Christians in these places. Perhaps it is because of these similarities and because they were so close together that Paul wanted the Colossians and the Laodiceans to share their letters.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How does Paul identify Jesus as God?\n\nPaul calls Jesus the “image” of God and the “firstborn” of all creation ([1:15](../01/15.md)). Neither of these descriptions is meant to describe Jesus as the first or best thing God created; instead, they put him outside the creation. This is clear from the next verse, which identifies him as creator ([1:16](../01/16.md)). If Jesus is not created, he is God. Being “before all things” and having “all things hold together” in him are statements that make the same affirmation ([1:17](../01/17.md)).\n\nPaul twice describes Jesus as having the “fullness” of God ([1:19](../01/19.md); [2:9](../02/09.md)). This does not mean that Jesus was particularly close with God or had God living inside him. Instead, it means that Jesus is everything that God is (the “fullness” of God).\n\nFinally, Jesus is seated at God’s right hand in heaven (3:1). This does not mean he is a powerful figure who obeys God. Instead, it means that he sits on the divine throne along with God, and he is God.\n\n### How does Paul identify Jesus as human?\n\nPaul says that Jesus died in “the body of his flesh” ([1:22](../01/22.md)). Additionally, when he states that Jesus is the “fullness” of God, this is true of him “bodily” ([2:9](../02/09.md)). When Paul says that Jesus has a “body,” this does not mean that Jesus simply used a body to look human. Instead, he means that Jesus is an embodied human like us.\n\n### What does Paul mean when he tells the Colossians they have died and come back to life?\n\nMultiple times throughout the letter, Paul tells the Colossians that they have died and risen with Christ. This does not mean that the Colossians have physically died and then returned from the dead. This language also is not just a figure of speech that Paul does not really mean. Rather, he means that God included believers with Christ when he died and resurrected. While the Colossians had not yet physically died and been resurrected, they could already experience death to the world and its powers, and new life with its blessings, because of their union with Christ in his death and resurrection.\n\n### What does Paul mean when he talks about knowledge?\n\nPaul uses knowledge language throughout his letter, including words such as “knowing,” “knowledge,” and “understanding.” Perhaps the false teachers promised “knowledge” of God and his will to those who listened to them, and Paul intended to show the Colossians that all the knowledge they needed could be found in Christ and his work. Whether this is true or not, Paul does clearly intend to tell the Colossians that growing in their knowledge of God is important and that this knowledge can be found in Christ. “Knowledge” refers to learning more about God, his will, and his work in the world, and “knowing” these things leads to new life and changed behavior.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Colossians?\n\nFor the following verses, there are differences between some of the ancient manuscripts. The ULT text follows the reading that most scholars consider to be original and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the language of wider communication in the region, translators may want to consider using the reading found in that version. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.\n\n* “Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Grace to you, and peace from God our Father.”\n* “Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf” ([1:7](../01/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf.”\n* “the Father, who has made you able to share the inheritance of the saints in the light” ([1:12](../01/12.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the Father, who has made us able to share the inheritance of the saints in the light.”\n* “in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins” ([1:14](../01/14.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.”\n* “having forgiven us all of our trespasses” ([2:13](../02/13.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “having forgiven you all of your trespasses.”\n* “When Christ, your life, is revealed” ([3:4](../03/04.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “When Christ, our life, is revealed.”\n* “the wrath of God is coming” ([3:6](../03/06.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.”\n* “so that you might know the things concerning us” ([4:8](../04/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “so that he might know the things concerning you.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	gtm3				0	# Colossians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Letter Opening (1:1–12)\n    * Greeting (1:1–2)\n    * Prayer of Thanksgiving (1:3–8)\n    * Prayer of Petition (1:9–12)\n2. Teaching Section (1:13–2:23)\n    * Christ and His Work (1:13–20)\n    * Christ’s Work Applied to the Colossians (1:21–23)\n    * Paul’s Ministry (1:24–2:5)\n\nPaul begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his and Timothy’s names, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. This is the way people typically began letters at this time.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Mystery\n\nPaul refers to a “mystery” for the first time in this chapter ([1:26–27](../01/26.md)). This does not refer to some secret truth that is hard to understand and that only a few privileged individuals can learn about. Instead, it refers to God’s plans that once were unknown but are now known to all his people. What is the content of this mystery? It is Christ himself, his work, and his union with believers. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])\n\n### Fullness\n\nPaul refers to “filling” or “fullness” four times in this chapter. First, Paul prays that the Colossians are “filled” with the knowledge of God’s will ([1:9](../01/09.md)). Second, Jesus has all the “fullness” of God ([1:19](../01/19.md)). Third, Paul “fills up” in his flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ ([1:24](../01/24.md)). Fourth, Paul makes the word of God “fully” known ([1:25](../01/25.md)). It is possible that Paul uses “filling” and “fullness” so often because it was something that the false teachers promised. Paul wishes to show instead how “fullness” comes through the work of Christ and through his own work on their behalf. Christ has God’s fullness, and Paul works for Christ by “filling” the Colossians, who then are “filled” with the knowledge of God’s will.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Images for Christian living\n\nPaul uses many different images to describe Christian living. In this chapter, he uses the images of “walking” and “bearing fruit” (1:10). These images show that Paul wants the Colossians to think about the Christian life as a life that is directed towards a goal (either a destination, if one is walking, or fruit, if one is growing). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])\n\n### Light versus dark\n\nPaul contrasts the “inheritance of the saints in the light” ([1:12](../01/12.md)) with the “authority of the darkness” ([1:12](../01/12.md)). The “light” describes what is good, desirable, and related to God’s favor. The “darkness” describes what is distant from God, opposed to him, and evil.\n\n### Head and body\n\nIn this chapter, Paul introduces an image that he will develop more fully in chapter 2: that of Christ as the head of the body, which is his church. This image identifies Christ as the source of life and direction for his church, just like the head is the source of life and direction for the body.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The lack of the afflictions of Christ\n\nIn [1:24](../01/24.md), Paul speaks of “the lack of the afflictions of Christ,” a lack that he fills up by his sufferings. This does not mean that Christ somehow failed in his mission and work, and Paul has to fill in the missing pieces. Instead, “lack” refers to something that Christ intentionally left for this followers to complete. He has called them to suffer, just as he himself did, to continue the mission of the church.\n\n### The “Christ-Hymn”\n\nMany scholars think that [1:15–20](../01/15.md) is an early Christian hymn that Paul has quoted to remind the Colossians of what they believe in common with other Christians. If this is true, it does not mean that this section says something different than what Paul thinks. Instead, Paul chose to quote it because he fully affirmed it. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could format these verses in a way that shows that they are from a hymn or poem.

1:1	xnhq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Παῦλος	1	In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the first person here.

1:1	yzlo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ Τιμόθεος ὁ ἀδελφὸς	1	This phrase does not mean that Timothy helped Paul write this letter. Paul was the author of this letter, as he shows by using the first person singular throughout the letter. What this does mean is that Timothy is with Paul and that Timothy is in agreement with what Paul writes. If it sounds in your language like Timothy is writing the letter with Paul, you could make Timothy’s supporting role more clear. Alternate translation: “with the support of Timothy, our fellow believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:1	f3ki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Τιμόθεος	1	**Timothy** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “to you who live in the city of Colossae and who are God’s people and faithful fellow believers who are united to the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:2	s9x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοῖς & ἁγίοις, καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ	1	The words **saints**, **faithful brothers**, and **in Christ** all describe people who are followers of Jesus. Paul is using all of these to describe one group of people. For example, he is not implying that **saints** and **faithful brothers in Christ** are two different groups. If using both **saints** and **faithful brothers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could join these together in a clearer way. Alternate translation: “to God’s faithful people, joined together as a family in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:2	cqfk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	After stating his name and the name of the person to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing for the Colossians. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May you experience kindness and peace within you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah” or “I pray that grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah will always be with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:2	jzhd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	The words **grace** and **peace** are abstract nouns. Your language may have a particular way of expressing these concepts, such as with verbs or description words. If so, you could use them in your translation. Alternate translation: “We pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will treat you kindly and give you peaceful relationships” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:2	egjk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1	Here and throughout the chapter, **Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God, who is our Father,” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples)
1:3	q1su		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	εὐχαριστοῦμεν & ἡμῶν	1	The word **We** here does not include the Colossians, but the word **our** here does include the Colossians (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:3	g0sn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε	1	Here, **always** is an exaggeration that the Colossians understood to mean that Paul and Timothy prayed for them often. If that would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “frequently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:4	z6eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀκούσαντες τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **faith**, you can express the idea behind this abstract noun in another way. Alternate translation: “having heard that you are trusting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:4	gjwb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἔχετε εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους,	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **love**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “how much you love all the saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:5	n1qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν ἐλπίδα	1	Here, **hope** refers not only to the attitude of hopefulness but also to what the believer hopes for, that is, what God has promised to give to all believers. If **hope** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “what you hope for” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:5	bmpc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὴν ἀποκειμένην	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “that God is reserving for” or “that God has prepared for” or “that God has ready for” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:5	xn8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **word** that is characterized by **truth**. This could refer to: (1) a message that is truth. Alternate translation: “the message that is true” (2) a message concerning the truth. Alternate translation: “the message about the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:5	ir6k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ λόγῳ	1	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the announcement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:6	p5rv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τοῦ παρόντος εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, the good news is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could be **present** with the Colossians. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “which was told to you in Colossae” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1:6	z3g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐν παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ	1	Here, **in all the world** is a generalization referring to the part of the **world** that Paul and the Colossians knew about. If **all the world** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **world** refers to the known world at that time. Alternate translation: “in every place that we know about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:6	wk21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐστὶν καρποφορούμενον καὶ αὐξανόμενον	1	Here, Paul speaks of the gospel as if it were a plant that could grow and produce fruit. He means that the gospel reaches more people and that it changes how people think and behave. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “is reaching more people so that they do what is pleasing to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:6	ev91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καθὼς καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Paul leaves out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your language needs these words, you could supply them from the context. Alternate translation: “just as this good news has reached you so that you do what is pleasing to God” or “just as it has done among you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1:6	ait7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπέγνωτε τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ	1	Here, **in truth** could describe (1) the way in which the Colossians learned about the grace of God. Alternate translation: “accurately grasped how God acts kindly” (2) the way God is gracious to the Colossians. Alternate translation: “learned about the true grace of God” or “understood how God truly acts kindly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:7	pz3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἐπαφρᾶ	1	**Epaphras** is the name of a man. He is the one who preached the good news to the people in Colossae. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:7	f8t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμῶν	1	Here, **our** does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:8	k2k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	The word **us** here does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:8	e7ez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ὑμῶν ἀγάπην	1	Here Paul is primarily talking about the **love** that the Colossians are showing to other believers. Of course they also love God. If you must specify the object of their love, and people might think that the Colossians do not love God if he is not mentioned, then you can include both. Alternate translation: “that you love God and all his people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:8	hzqq			ἐν Πνεύματι	1	Alternate translation: “which is by the power of the Holy Spirit” or “which you do through the power of the Holy Spirit”
1:9	f2xd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & ἠκούσαμεν, οὐ παυόμεθα	1	The word **we** here does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:9	u7zh			ἀφ’ ἧς ἡμέρας ἠκούσαμεν	1	Alternate translation: “from the day Epaphras told us these things”
1:9	crnv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐ παυόμεθα	1	Here, **have not stopped** is an exaggeration that the Colossians would have understood to mean that Paul and Timothy pray often for the Colossians. If this way of speaking would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “have been frequently” or “have made a habit of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:9	qxnu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ παυόμεθα	1	Here Paul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “have kept” or “are continually” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1:9	w2a7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα πληρωθῆτε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as though they were containers that could be filled up. By speaking this way, he emphasizes that the Colossians should know God’s **will** in every area of their lives. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “that God would enable you to understand fully what he wants you to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:9	kmea		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πληρωθῆτε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in an active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God would fill you with” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:9	hson		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πληρωθῆτε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind the words **knowledge** and **will**, you can express those ideas in another way, such as with verbs. Alternate translation: “you might fully know what he has planned for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:9	s903		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	πληρωθῆτε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ,	1	Here, **in all wisdom and spiritual understanding** identifies how the Colossians are **filled**. The phrase does not describe God’s **will**. If what **in all wisdom and spiritual understanding** describes would be misunderstood in your language, you could move the phrase so that it appears immediately after **filled**. Alternate translation: “you might be filled in all wisdom and spiritual understanding with the knowledge of his will” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1:9	mzz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **wisdom** and **understanding**, you can express the ideas with adjectives or verbs. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “which includes being spiritually very wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:9	k8x2			σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ	1	Here, **spiritual wisdom and understanding** could refer to: (1) wisdom and understanding that comes from the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “wisdom and understanding given by the Holy Spirit” (2) wisdom and understanding in spiritual matters. Alternate translation: “wisdom and understanding about spiritual things”
1:9	w78g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ	1	The words **wisdom** and **understanding** mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the breadth of spiritual wisdom. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word. Alternate translation: “spiritual comprehension” or “spiritual insight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:10	m4hf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	περιπατῆσαι ἀξίως τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Here, the word **walk** is a figurative way to refer to behavior in life. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “to behave in the way that the Lord expects you to behave” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:10	vv4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς πᾶσαν ἀρεσκείαν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns, you can express the idea behind the phrase **pleasing way** with a verb.

1:10	vfp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ καρποφοροῦντες	1	Paul is speaking figuratively of the Colossian believers as if they were trees or plants and of the things that they do as if it were their fruit. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a different figure or in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “performing many good deeds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:10	b9l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	αὐξανόμενοι τῇ ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you can express the idea with a verb. Alternate translation: “knowing God better and better” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:11	gxv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δυναμούμενοι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea with an active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God strengthening you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:11	da4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ κράτος τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe **power** that is characterized by God’s **glory**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can use an adjective such as “glorious” or “great” instead of the noun **glory**. Alternate translation: “his glorious power” or “his great power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:11	b2uq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς πᾶσαν ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν μετὰ χαρᾶς	1	This is a purpose phrase. Paul is stating the purpose for which the Colossians have been **strengthened with all power**. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose phrases. Alternate translation: “so that you have all endurance and patience with joy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:11	xqlu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **patience** tells what kind of **endurance** the Colossians can have. If your language does not use this form, you can express the meaning differently. Alternate translation: “patient endurance.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1:11	uqtt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσαν ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **endurance** and **patience**, you can express the ideas with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “endure always and wait patiently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:11	jzk9			πᾶσαν ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν μετὰ χαρᾶς	1	Here, **with joy** could describe (1) the way that the Colossians are to have endurance and patience (2) the way that the Colossians are to give thanks in verse 12. Alternate translation: “all endurance and patience”
1:12	zsdp			εὐχαριστοῦντες	1	Some Bible versions connect the phrase “with joy” at the end of verse 11 to the phrase at the beginning of verse 12, instead of connecting it to verse 11. Alternate translation: “with joy giving thanks”
1:12	t5lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τῷ Πατρὶ	1	**Father** is an important title that describes the relationship between God and Jesus, and it also describes the relationship between God and believers, who are adopted children. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:12	lt2q			ἱκανώσαντι ὑμᾶς	1	Alternate translation: “who has qualified you”
1:12	ss5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς τὴν μερίδα τοῦ κλήρου τῶν ἁγίων	1	This is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which God made the Colossians **able**. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose clauses. Alternate translation (without a comma preceding): “so that you can share the inheritance of the saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:12	r2zw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν μερίδα τοῦ κλήρου	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **share** that is characterized by **inheritance**. If your language does not use this form to express that meaning, you can use a verbal phrase like “receive your portion of” or “take part in.” Alternate translation: “to take part in the inheritance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:12	hno0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ κλήρου τῶν ἁγίων	1	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **inheritance** is for the **saints**. If your language does not use this form to express that meaning, you can use a descriptive phrase such as “that God is keeping for” or “that belongs to” instead. Alternate translation: “the inheritance that belongs to the saints” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:12	hkf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ φωτί	1	Here, **in the light** is the opposite of the “authority of the darkness” in the next verse ([1:13](../01/13.md)) and refers to belonging to God and being part of his kingdom. The metaphor of light representing God, goodness, and heaven is very common in the Bible, and it would be useful to retain it if it communicates well. But if it might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “in the spiritual kingdom of God” or “in God’s glorious presence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:13	dw5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους	1	Here, **darkness** is a metaphor for evil. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the authority of evil powers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:13	z8b5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe an **authority** that is characterized by **darkness** (a metaphor for evil). If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can use a verb such as “rule” or “control” for the noun **authority**. Alternate translation: “the evil that ruled us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:13	i0sn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **authority**, you can express that idea in another way, such as with a verb. Alternate translation: “the dark things that controlled us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:13	kgvf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μετέστησεν	1	Here Paul speaks about a change in who rules over believers as if they were moving from one location to another. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “made us subject instead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:13	l2ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the people who belong to God’s Son as if they were citizens of a kingdom. He means that they are members of a community that obeys God’s Son Jesus and belongs to him. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “so that his beloved Son reigns over us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:13	o1pl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ Υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ	1	Paul uses the possessive form to characterize the **Son** as **his beloved**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can express the idea behind **his beloved** with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “of the Son he loves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:13	zav6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ	1	**Son** is an important title that describes the relationship between God the Father (who is mentioned in the previous verse ([1:12](../01/12.md))) and Jesus. Alternate translation: “of Jesus, God the Father’s beloved Son” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:14	qe6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν	1	Some later manuscripts add “through his blood” after **redemption**. Most likely, “through his blood” was accidentally added because of how similar this verse is to [Ephesians 1:7](../eph/01/07.md), which does include “through his blood.” Most likely, you should not include “through his blood” in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:14	wh6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν	1	Here, the word **redemption** does not refer to a payment or to the act of redeeming. Instead, it refers to the result of the act of redeeming. If **redemption** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word such as “freedom” to express this idea. Alternate translation: “we have freedom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:14	v5d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν, τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **redemption** and **forgiveness**, you can express the idea by using verbs. Alternate translation: “God has redeemed us; that is, he has forgiven our sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:14	pbmh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **forgiveness** concerns **sins**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can use a verb for **forgiveness** and make **sins** its object or complement. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to replace the comma before it with a semicolon. Alternate translation: “that is, God has forgiven us for our sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:15	j5u9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου	1	Here, **image** does not mean a representation of something that is visible, like a photo or a reflection. Instead, **image** refers to how the Son perfectly reveals the Father. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could replace **image** with an expression that emphasizes how the Son reveals the Father. Alternate translation: “What the invisible God is like can be seen in his Son” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:15	rgb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου	1	The word **invisible** does not mean that God the Father could be seen by people but hides himself. Instead, it means that human sight is unable to perceive God the Father, since he is not part of the created world. If **invisible** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase to clarify the idea. Alternate translation: “of God, whom humans are unable to see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:15	h945		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως	1	The word **firstborn** does not refer to when Jesus was born. Instead, it refers to his position as the eternal Son of God the Father. In this sense, **firstborn** is a metaphor that means that he existed as God before God created anything and that he is most important. You could emphasize either or both of these ideas in your translation. Alternate translation: “God’s Son, the most important one over all creation” or “God’s Son, who existed as God before all creation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:15	af6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πάσης κτίσεως	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **creation**, you can express the idea by using a verb such as “create.” Alternate translation: “of all that God created” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:16	kru3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη τὰ πάντα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “For in him God created all things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:16	zed8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη τὰ πάντα	1	Paul here seems to speak as if God created everything inside the Son. This is a metaphor that describes the involvement of the Son when God created all things, which you could clarify by making both the Son and the Father the subjects of **created**. If your language can clearly indicate different types of agency, you could identify God the Father as the primary agent and God the Son as the secondary agent. Alternate translation: “God the Father created all things through the work of God the Son” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:16	ho8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1	Paul refers to two opposite things, the **heavens** and the **earth**, as a way to include not only them but also everything else in what God and his Son created. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in every part of the universe” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism)
1:16	s8h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	τὰ ὁρατὰ καὶ τὰ ἀόρατα	1	Paul refers to two opposite things, the **visible and the invisible**, as another way to refer to everything that God and his Son created. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “whether people can see them or not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
1:16	fkic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εἴτε θρόνοι, εἴτε κυριότητες, εἴτε ἀρχαὶ, εἴτε ἐξουσίαι	1	The words **thrones**, **dominions**, **governments**, and **authorities** here refer to different kinds of angels or other spiritual beings that are not specified as being good or evil. They are examples of what is **invisible**. It may be that the false teachers were teaching that these beings should be worshiped. But Paul is emphasizing here that God the Father created all of these spiritual beings through his Son, and so the Son is much greater than these. If these four words would be misunderstood in your language, you could (1) identify that these are spiritual beings and translate as many of these names as you have different words for. Alternate translation: “Including all spiritual beings, which can be called thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities” (2) use names from your culture that identify different classes of angels or spiritual beings. Alternate translation: “Whether angels or archangels or spirit rulers” (3) summarize without using specific names. Alternate translation: “Including all types of powerful spiritual beings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:16	zl7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν ἔκτισται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “through him and for him God created all things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:16	c3lm			δι’ αὐτοῦ & ἔκτισται	1	The phrase **through him** shows God the Son’s involvement in creating the world with the Father. Alternate translation: “God the Father created by working through the Son”
1:16	nmr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν	1	Here, **for him** refers to the Son as the purpose or goal of all creation. If the meaning of **for him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that creation’s purpose is to honor and glorify the Son. Alternate translation: “and everything exists to glorify him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:17	wk9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	αὐτός ἐστιν πρὸ πάντων	1	The word **before** refers to time, not location. It means that the Son did not come into being when God created everything, but rather he existed as God before anything was created. If the meaning of **before** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to prior time. Alternate translation: “before God created anything, the Son existed as God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
1:17	m4lp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν	1	Paul is speaking here as if all created things **hold together** because they are inside the Son. By speaking in this way, Paul means that everything that God created continues to exist because the Son actively works to preserve everything. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “he controls everything so that it works the way it should” or “he is the one who makes sure everything has its proper place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:18	q8i3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτός ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλὴ τοῦ σώματος, τῆς ἐκκλησίας	1	Paul speaks of Jesus’ position over the **church** as if he were the **head** on the human **body**. As the head rules and directs the body, so Jesus rules and directs the church. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or express the idea with a simile or in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “he rules and directs the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:18	j6uq			ἡ ἀρχή	1	The word **beginning** could refer to (1) the origin of something; here, the origin of the church. Alternate translation: “the origin of the church” or “the one who started the church” (2) a position of power or authority. Alternate translation: “the ruler” or “the one with authority”
1:18	s12x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Paul describes Jesus’ resurrection **from among the dead** as if someone gave birth to him as her first child. This figure helps us to see that this new life was not like his old life, because he can never die again. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the first one to come back to new life” or “the first person to permanently rise from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:18	ybqn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the dead people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:18	uqrv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἵνα γένηται ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτὸς πρωτεύων	1	This clause could identify: (1) the result of Jesus starting the church and coming back from the dead. Alternate translation: “with the result that he is first among all things” (2) the purpose of Jesus starting the church and coming back from the dead. Alternate translation: “in order that he might be first among all things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:18	jjgh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γένηται ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτὸς πρωτεύων	1	Paul here describes Jesus as if he were **first** to do or be something. This does not refer to time or sequence, but rather it refers to importance. If the meaning of **first** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable expression or in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “he himself might become the most important person in all creation” or “he himself might be greater than everything and anybody else” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:19	npzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	The word **for** provides a reason for previous statements. If **for** by itself would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify for which statements this verse gives a reason. These statements could be (1) everything in the previous verse, including the Son’s headship over the church, his founding of the church, his resurrection, and his status as most important. Alternate translation: “He is all these things because” (2) why the Son is first among all things. Alternate translation: “He is first among all things because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:19	nyos		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν αὐτῷ εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα κατοικῆσαι	1	The verb **was pleased** implies a personal subject, which must be God the Father. By using the phrase **all the fullness**, Paul is speaking figuratively of everything that God the Father is, either by ellipsis or metonymy. If this way of speaking would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “God the Father was pleased to make all of his fullness dwell in the Son” or “all the fullness of God the Father was pleased to dwell in the Son” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:19	zu89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα κατοικῆσαι	1	Here, Paul speaks figuratively of the Son as though he were a house in which God’s **fullness** could **dwell**. This does not mean that God lives inside of the Son or that the Son is part of God. This means that the Son has all the divinity of God. It means that the Son is fully God just as the Father is fully God. If the metaphor might be misunderstood in your language, you could state it more plainly. Alternate translation: “the Son is fully God in every way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:19	wmdw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα	1	In the context, **fullness** stands for the **fullness** of divinity, or everything that characterizes God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clear that **fullness** refers to the **fullness** of God. Alternate translation: “the full divinity of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:20	qweh			ἀποκαταλλάξαι	1	This verse continues the sentence from the previous verse, so **to reconcile** continues the same verb from there, “was pleased,” along with its implied subject, God the Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could repeat that subject and verb here. Alternate translation: “God the Father was pleased to reconcile”
1:20	cf2d			τὰ πάντα	1	Here, **all things** includes everything that God created, including people. If **all things** would be misunderstood in your language, you could be more specific. Alternate translation: “all things and all people”
1:20	c3qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰρηνοποιήσας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **peace**, you can express this idea in another way. Alternate translation: “having made things right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:20	as3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe **blood** characterized by **his cross**, which is the location where the blood was shed. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can make the relationship between the two words clearer with a short phrase such as “shed on.” Alternate translation: “the blood shed on his cross.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:20	x5av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **blood** stands for the death of Christ on the cross. If the meaning of **blood** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word that stands for death or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “his death on the cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:20	mbra		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τὰ πάντα εἰς αὐτόν & εἴτε τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἴτε τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	The last part of this verse (**whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens**) describes **all things**, found near the beginning of the verse. If your language does not separate a description from the thing it describes, you can move the description next to **all things**. Alternate translation: “all things, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens, to himself” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
1:20	quxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	εἴτε τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἴτε τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Paul refers to the **things on the earth** and **the things in the heavens** to include them and everything in between, that is, everything in all of creation. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “everything in the whole creation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
1:21	kv5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	ποτε	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThe phrase **At one time** does not refer to one specific instance in time when the Colossians were alienated from God. Instead, it refers to all the time before they believed in Jesus. If **At one time** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what **time** Paul is referring to. Alternate translation: “During the time before you believed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
1:21	wp3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὄντας ἀπηλλοτριωμένους	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can describe the Colossians’ state with an active form. Alternate translation: “did not want a relationship with God” or “were people who did not want to be near God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:21	rn6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπηλλοτριωμένους, καὶ ἐχθροὺς	1	Paul assumes that the Colossians will know from whom they were **alienated** and with whom they were **enemies**: God. If your language would include this implied information, you could include a reference to “God” in this sentence. Alternate translation: “alienated from God and were his enemies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:21	wa9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ διανοίᾳ ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τοῖς πονηροῖς,	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **thought** and **deeds**, you can express the ideas with relative clauses. Alternate translation: “in what you thought, in what you did that was evil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:22	f8yw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	νυνὶ δὲ	1	The word **now** does not refer to the moment at which Paul writes this letter or the moment at which it is read to the Colossians. Instead, it refers to the time since they believed, including the present moment. This follows as a sequence to the previous verse, which referred to the time when they had not yet believed. If the meaning of **now** would be misunderstood your language, you could add a phrase such as “that you have believed.” Alternate translation: “But now that you have faith in Jesus,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
1:22	vvl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	The word **But** here introduces a strong contrast from the previous sentence. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a strong contrast from what was just said. Alternate translation: “Instead of that,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1:22	x2pl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ σώματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the phrase **the body of his flesh** to refer to Jesus and everything that he did while in a human body. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “by Jesus in his physical body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:22	iftn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῷ σώματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul describes Jesus’ **body** that is characterized by **flesh**. This refers to Jesus’ body during his earthly life, not his glorified body after the resurrection. If **the body of his flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that makes this idea clear. Alternate translation: “his physical body” or “his body before the resurrection” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:22	d2x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τοῦ θανάτου	1	Here, Paul has not stated whose **death** this is. This **death** is not that of the Colossians but that of Jesus on the cross. If your language would state who died, you could add a possessive word to clarify. Alternate translation: “through his death” or “through Jesus’ death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:22	t8ls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	παραστῆσαι ὑμᾶς	1	Here, **to present you** gives the purpose for which God reconciled the Colossians by the death of his Son. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a purpose phrase such as “so that” or “in order to.” Alternate translation: “so that he might present you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:22	ejt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παραστῆσαι ὑμᾶς ἁγίους, καὶ ἀμώμους, καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους, κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul is describing the Colossians as though Jesus had brought them to stand before God the Father, by which he means that Jesus has made them acceptable to God. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “to make you acceptable before him, holy and blameless and above reproach” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:22	u94j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἁγίους, καὶ ἀμώμους, καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους	1	The words **blameless** and **above reproach** are adjectives that describe a person or thing that is free from blemishes and that cannot be blamed for doing anything wrong. If the meaning of these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could use relative clauses instead. Alternate translation: “as people who are holy and who have no faults and who cannot be blamed for doing anything wrong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:22	rvtf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἁγίους, καὶ ἀμώμους, καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους	1	These words, **holy**, **blameless**, and **above reproach**, mean basically the same thing here. The repetition is used to emphasize the completeness of what the Son did to take away the Colossians’ sin. After trusting in Jesus, they are now completely morally pure. If your language does not use repetition in this way or you do not have three words that mean this, you can use fewer words and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “completely pure” or “without any sin at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:23	s069		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ γε ἐπιμένετε	1	Here Paul explains that the Colossians need to continue in their faith for what he said in the previous verse to be true about them. In other words, in order for them to be reconciled to God, blameless and without reproach, they need to continue in the faith. However, he does not think that this is a hypothetical situation or something that is likely not true. Instead, Paul thinks that they are continuing in their faith, and he uses this statement with **if** to encourage them to keep doing so. If your language does not use **if** in this context, you can rephrase the condition into a circumstance or an assumption. Alternate translation: “provided that you continue” or “presuming that you continue” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1:23	h5u9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **faith**, you can express the idea behind this abstract noun in another way. Alternate translation: “to trust God” or “to believe God’s message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:23	zja3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τεθεμελιωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι	1	The words **founded** and **firm** mean basically the same thing. The words **not being moved** repeat the idea again in a negative way. The repetition is used to emphasize that it is important for the Colossians to continue strong in their faith. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can use one word for this idea and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “very firm” or “like a rock” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:23	x600		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τεθεμελιωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι, καὶ μὴ μετακινούμενοι ἀπὸ	1	Here Paul speaks of the Colossians as if they were a building that was **founded** and sits on a **firm** foundation so that it cannot be **moved** from its place, which means that they have good basis for their faith and will keep believing in all situations. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with an equivalent metaphor in your culture or express it in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “holding onto it and grasping it tightly and not letting go of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:23	kgp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	Here Paul uses to possessive to explain that **hope** comes from the **gospel**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can express the idea by using a phrase such as “that comes from” or “gained from.” Alternate translation: “the hope that comes from the gospel” or “how you hope, which you gained from the gospel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:23	prwf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **hope**, you can express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “expecting God to fulfill the gospel” or “waiting for God to complete the good news” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:23	d9kg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῦ κηρυχθέντος ἐν πάσῃ κτίσει τῇ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form. You could: (1) change **proclaimed** to “heard” and make **every creature** the subject. Alternate translation: “which every creature that is under heaven has heard” (2) specify that “fellow believers” is the subject of **proclaimed**. Alternate translation: “which fellow believers have proclaimed to every creature that is under heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:23	q21b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐν πάσῃ κτίσει τῇ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	Here Paul uses an exaggeration that the Colossians would have understood to emphasize how far the good news has spread. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or qualify the claim. Alternate translation: “to people in many different places” or “to people in every place we know about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:23	lptz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῇ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	In Paul’s culture, **under heaven** refers to the visible part of creation that humans regularly interact with. It excludes spiritual beings, the stars, and anything else in **heaven**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **under heaven** with a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “that is on the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:23	g8iq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	οὗ ἐγενόμην ἐγὼ Παῦλος διάκονος	1	Here Paul speaks as if the good news were a person of whom he could become **a servant**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could explain that Paul is **a servant** of God, but his task from God is to proclaim the good news. Alternate translation: “which I, Paul, proclaim as God has commanded me, his servant, to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1:24	z01x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	νῦν	1	The word **Now** indicates that Paul wishes to tell the Colossians how he is currently serving the gospel. It does not indicate a change of topic, as it sometimes does in English. If **Now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a longer phrase to express this idea. Alternate translation: “While I write this letter,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1:24	gq1n			ἐν τοῖς παθήμασιν ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν	1	Alternate translation: “while I suffer for your sake”
1:24	fm9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνταναπληρῶ τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου	1	Paul speaks of his **flesh** as if it were a container that could **fill** up with **afflictions**. By this, he means that his bodily sufferings function to satisfy a specific purpose, which here is to finish what **Christ** started with his **afflictions**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “with my bodily suffering, I finish what the Messiah started when he suffered. I do this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:24	nb2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul is not saying that there is a **lack** in Christ’s **afflictions** because those **afflictions** did not succeed in doing what they were supposed to do. Instead, the **lack** refers to what Christ wished for his disciples to do as his servants. The **lack**, then, is something that Christ intentionally did not accomplish, because he wanted Paul to do it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could rephrase **lack** so that it is clearer that Christ intentionally left something for Paul to do. Alternate translation: “the afflictions that Christ has called me to suffer to complete his work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:24	k5yd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Paul uses two possessive forms to speak about the **lack** that characterizes the **afflictions** that **Christ** suffered. If your language would not use possessive forms to express that idea, you could express the idea with a relative clause or two clauses. Alternate translation: “what Christ, when he suffered, left for me to suffer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:24	mge9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ, ὅ ἐστιν ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	Here Paul speaks of the **church** as if it were Christ’s **body**, and he provides the explanation of what **body** means. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the **church** first and then identify it as his **body**. Alternate translation: “the church, which is his body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:25	gc4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἧς ἐγενόμην ἐγὼ διάκονος	1	If your language would specify who called Paul to be a servant of the church, you could rephrase this clause so that God is the subject and Paul is the object. Alternate translation: “God appointed me to be a servant of the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:25	j4xm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν οἰκονομίαν	1	The word **stewardship** refers to managing a household or, more generally, to directing any group or process. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **stewardship**, you can replace the word with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “authoritative oversight” or “superintending authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:25	t0oa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν οἰκονομίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **stewardship** that could (1) come from God. Alternate translation: “the stewardship from God” (2) belong to God and be **given** to Paul. Alternate translation: “God’s own stewardship” or “God’s own oversight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:25	s0ax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὴν δοθεῖσάν μοι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “that God gave to me” or “that he gave me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:25	t6ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe a word that is (1) from God. Alternate translation: “the word that came from God” (2) about God. Alternate translation: “the word about God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:25	elpv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the message from God” or “God’s message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:26	f3mt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ μυστήριον τὸ ἀποκεκρυμμένον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “the mystery that God had hidden” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:26	ijtl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ μυστήριον	1	Here Paul calls “the word of God,” from [1:25](../01/25.md), a **mystery**. This does not mean that it is hard to understand, but rather, it had not yet been revealed. Now, however, Paul says that it “has been revealed.” If your language would not use **mystery** to refer to something that has been revealed, you could replace **mystery** with a short descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “the concealed message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:26	emw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ ἀποκεκρυμμένον ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γενεῶν	1	This clause does not mean that the **ages** and the **generations** were unable to understand the “mystery.” Instead, **from the ages** and **from the generations** refer to the time during which the mystery was hidden. Those from whom the mystery was hidden are not expressed explicitly, but it is clear that they are those who were alive during those times. If your language would express explicitly those from whom the mystery was hidden, you could insert it into the sentence. Alternate translation: “that has been hidden from the people who lived during the ages and in the generations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:26	z8gv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γενεῶν	1	These phrases speak about the passage of time. The word **ages** refers to periods of time that are marked off by specific boundaries (often major events), while the word **generations** refers to time periods marked off by human birth and death. The **mystery** has been **hidden** during all these time periods up until the present time. If these phrases would be misunderstood in your language, you could use equivalent expressions or short phrases. Alternate translation: “during all time periods, while people were born and died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:26	ipfn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νῦν δὲ	1	The word **now** does not refer to the time during which Paul wrote this letter. Instead, it contrasts with the **ages** and **generations** and refers to the time or “age” after the work of Jesus. If **now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could further identify what time **now** refers to. Alternate translation: “but now that Jesus has come, it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:26	a9kw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐφανερώθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has revealed it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:27	c8yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου	1	Paul emphasizes the scope of **the glory** by speaking as if it had wealth or **riches**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable statement or express the idea with an adverb such as “very” or an adjective such as “abundant.” Alternate translation: “the abundant glory of this mystery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:27	axm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to connect **riches** to **glory**, which then characterizes the **mystery**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could translate both **riches** and **glory** as adjectives or adverbs describing the **mystery**. Alternate translation: “this richly glorious mystery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:27	mj8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **glory**, you can express that idea in another way, such as with a description word. Alternate translation: “this richly glorious mystery” or “this abundantly wonderful mystery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:27	hm8q			ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1	This could refer to: (1) how the mystery applies to all people, including **Gentiles**. Alternate translation: “that applies to every person, including the Gentiles” (2) where God makes the mystery known. Alternate translation: “to the Gentiles”
1:27	c7ln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Paul speaks of the believers as if they were containers in which **Christ** is present. The expression means basically the same thing as “you in Christ.” If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the same translation you have used for being “in Christ.” Alternate translation: “your union with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:27	mr83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης	1	Here Paul speaks of a **hope** that relates to **glory**. This could refer to: (1) hoping for, or expecting, glory. Alternate translation: “the expectation of becoming glorious” (2) a hope that is glorious. Alternate translation: “the glorious hope” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:27	nkz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind the words **hope** and **glory**, you can express those ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “with whom we can expect to share his glorious life” or “who makes us confidently hope for living with him in heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:28	va1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς καταγγέλλομεν & παραστήσωμεν	1	The pronoun **we** in this verse does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:28	lyz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντα ἄνθρωπον	-1	Here, **every man** refers to every person whom Paul has told about Jesus. If **every man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include this information. Alternate translation: “every man whom we talk to … each of them … each of them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:28	pwff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	-1	Here, the word **man** does not refer to only male people but to any human being. If **man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a term that refers to humans in general. Alternate translation: “human” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:28	y1sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάσῃ σοφίᾳ	1	Here Paul speaks figuratively when he says that he uses **all wisdom**, by which he means that he uses all of the wisdom that he possesses. He does not mean that he possesses all the wisdom that exists. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could state this more plainly. Alternate translation: “all of the wisdom that we have” or “all of the wisdom that God has given us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:28	p1la		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα παραστήσωμεν	1	Paul here explains the goal or purpose for which he and those with him “admonish” and “teach” people. In your translation, use a phrase that designates goal or purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that we may present” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:28	rrvr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παραστήσωμεν πάντα ἄνθρωπον τέλειον ἐν Χριστῷ	1	In this context, when Paul says that he intends to **present** people, he does not say to whom or where he will **present** them. If your language would include this information, you could explain what the situation is. Paul could be referring to (1) when people appear before God on the judgment day. Alternate translation: “we may present every man complete in Christ to God the Father on the judgment day” (2) when people worship God. Alternate translation: “we may present every man complete in Christ when they come before God in worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:28	uk2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τέλειον	1	The word **complete** in this context means that a person is what he or she is supposed to be and is able to do what he or she is called to do. If **complete** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that has this meaning, such as “perfect” or “excellent,” or you could translate **complete** with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “fit for what God has called him to be” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:29	ejqu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κοπιῶ, ἀγωνιζόμενος	1	The words **labor** and **striving** mean very similar things. The repetition emphasizes how hard Paul works. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “work hard” or “labor greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:29	sj4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τὴν ἐνέργειαν αὐτοῦ, τὴν ἐνεργουμένην ἐν ἐμοὶ	1	The word **working** is repeated here to emphasize God’s activity in Paul that enables him to do what he does. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can just use the word once and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “his constant working in me” or “how he greatly enables me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:29	n1h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ τὴν ἐνέργειαν αὐτοῦ, τὴν ἐνεργουμένην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **working**, you can express the idea with a verb. Alternate translation: “according to how God works, who works” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:29	f397		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δυνάμει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you can express the idea with an adjective or adverb. Alternate translation: “in powerful ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Instead, he makes it clear that he is referring to thinking that is “empty” and full of “deceit,” that comes from traditions of humans and the “elemental principles.” All this “philosophy” is bad because it is not “according to Christ.” The “philosophy” that Paul attacks, then, is any attempt to make sense of the world that does not do so in line with Christ and his work.\n\n### Fullness\n\nJust as in the last chapter, “fullness” is an important idea that Paul refers to [2:9–10](../02/09.md). Again, Christ has the divine “fullness,” and he “fills” the Colossians. No other source of “fullness” is needed.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Head and body\n\nAs in the last chapter, Christ is called the “head,” both of powerful rulers ([2:10](../02/10.md)) and of his church [2:19](../02/19.md). Paul uses this language to identify Christ as (1) the supreme ruler, just as the head rules over the body, and (2) the source of life for the church, just as a body is dead without its head. Paul also identifies the church as the body of Christ in [2:19](../02/19.md). Here, his point is that the church cannot survive and grow without being connected to Christ, just as a body does not live or grow without a head. Finally, Paul refers to a “body” in [2:17](../02/17.md), but here the metaphor is different. The word “body” refers to any object that can cast a shadow (not primarily to an organic, human body) and here the “body” (the object) is Christ, who casts a shadow, which is identified as old covenant regulations.\n\n### Circumcision and baptism\n\nIn [2:11–13](../02/11.md), Paul uses the old covenant sign of circumcision to refer to removing the “the body of flesh,” and he uses the new covenant sign of baptism to refer to “being buried” with Christ. He uses these two signs to show how Christians are united with Christ, freed from sin, and given new life.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Flesh\n\nIn Colossians, Paul uses “flesh” to refer to human, embodied existence in the world before the resurrection and before God creates the new heavens and earth. He uses “flesh” neutrally to refer to physical presence in [2:1](../02/01.md); [2:5](../02/05.md). In many other places, however, he uses “flesh” to refer to the weakness and sinfulness of humans as they live in ways that fit with this broken world ([2:11](../02/11.md), [13](../02/13.md), [18](../02/18.md), [23](../02/23.md)). Often, “flesh” in these situations is translated with something like “sinful nature.” However, it is perhaps better to emphasize both weakness and sinfulness, and the term “nature” can be confusing. For examples of some ways to translate “flesh,” see the UST and notes in this chapter.\n\n### The false teaching\n\nIn this chapter, Paul gives some information about what the false teachers are saying and doing. However, it is not enough to give us a full picture of who they were and what they taught. What is clear is that they spoke about extraordinary experiences, were interested in spiritual beings, and gave commands about behavior that at least sometimes were related to Old Testament law. If possible, keep your translation as vague as Paul’s own description of the false teachers.
2:1	tt6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThe word **For** introduces the reason why Paul told them in [1:29](../01/29.md) about how hard he works. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make the transition more explicit. Alternate translation: “I tell you about my hard work because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:1	dqg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡλίκον ἀγῶνα ἔχω	1	Here, the word **struggle** is directly related to the word “striving” in [1:29](../01/29.md). Just as in that verse, it is usually used for striving to win a contest, whether athletic, legal, or military. Paul uses the word here to indicate how much he cares for the Colossians and how hard he works for their benefit. If that meaning of **struggle** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “how much care I have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:1	xoih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡλίκον ἀγῶνα ἔχω	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **struggle**, you can express the idea behind this abstract noun by combining it with the verb **have** and using a verb such as “struggle.” Alternate translation: “how much I struggle” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:1	fn4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ, καὶ ὅσοι οὐχ ἑόρακαν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐν σαρκί	1	This list includes the Colossians and the Laodiceans among those who have not seen Paul’s **face in the flesh**. If this inclusion would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse the order of the list and include **you** and **those at Laodicea** among those who **have not seen** Paul’s face. Alternate translation: “for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, including you and those at Laodicea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:1	rj7d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐχ ἑόρακαν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐν σαρκί	1	In Paul’s culture, seeing a **face in the flesh** refers to meeting someone in person. If the meaning of **have not seen my face in the flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “have not personally made my acquaintance” or “have not personally met me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:2	ge1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	αὐτῶν	1	Paul here switches from the second person to the third person because he wishes to include everyone he has not met in person, including the Colossians. If this switch would be misunderstood in your language, you could (1) use the second person from the previous verse but make it clear that this includes everyone Paul has not met in person. Alternate translation “your hearts and their” (2) retain the third person here and reverse the list in the previous verse as suggested by the note there (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
2:2	oyih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παρακληθῶσιν αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν, συμβιβασθέντες	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express these verbs in their active forms, with Paul as the subject of the “encouraging” and God as the subject of the “bringing together.” Alternate translation: “I might encourage their hearts, with God bringing them together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:2	spxx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν	1	Here when Paul refers to **their hearts**, the Colossians would have understood him to mean the entire person. Paul uses **hearts** because his culture identified **hearts** as the body part where people experienced encouragement. If that meaning of **their hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the location where people experience encouragement in your culture, or you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “they” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:2	a4px		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πᾶν πλοῦτος τῆς πληροφορίας	1	Paul here speaks as if **full assurance** could be characterized as having **all the riches**. He uses this metaphor to describe **the full assurance** as complete and valuable. If **all the riches of the full assurance** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the complete and valuable full assurance” or “all the blessings of the full assurance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:2	kdg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς πληροφορίας τῆς συνέσεως	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **full assurance** that is gained from **understanding**. From the rest of the verse, it is clear that what is “understood” is **the mystery of God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a relative clause to translate **of understanding**. Alternate translation: “of the full assurance that comes from understanding” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:2	qgi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς πᾶν πλοῦτος τῆς πληροφορίας τῆς συνέσεως; εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ μυστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **full assurance**, **understanding**, and **knowledge**, you can express the ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “having all the riches that come when they completely trust God because they understand, that is, they know the mystery of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:2	ahpn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τῆς συνέσεως; εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν	1	Here, the words **understanding** and **knowledge** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses both words to emphasize the breadth of spiritual knowledge he speaks about. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word or translate **understanding** with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “of wise knowledge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:2	v13e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ μυστηρίου	1	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **knowledge** about the **mystery**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate **knowledge** with a verb such as “knowing” or use different prepositions, such as “about.” Alternate translation: “knowing about the mystery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:2	v9az		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ μυστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul here uses the possessive form to speak about a **mystery** that comes from **God**. Only **God** can reveal the content of this **mystery**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can express the idea by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “the mystery that God reveals” or “the mystery known by God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:3	o2ob		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ᾧ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly to whom the word **whom** refers. The word **whom** could refer to: (1) the mystery. Alternate translation: “in this mystery” (2) Christ. Alternate translation: “in the Messiah.” Since [2:2](../02/02.md) identifies the mystery with Christ, both options express what Paul is saying, so pick the option that most clearly communicates the idea in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:3	w74d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰσιν πάντες οἱ θησαυροὶ τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως ἀπόκρυφοι	1	If your language does not use this form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:3	vhsr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ᾧ εἰσιν πάντες οἱ θησαυροὶ & ἀπόκρυφοι	1	Paul here speaks of the Messiah as if he were a container that could “hide” **treasures**. He speaks this way to emphasize the value of what Christians receive from God when they are united to the Messiah. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “from whom all the blessings … can be received” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:3	w4mr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	οἱ θησαυροὶ τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως	1	Paul here uses the possessive form to explain what the **treasures** are: **wisdom** and **knowledge**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can clarify that **wisdom** and **knowledge** are the **treasures**. Alternate translation: “the treasures, which are wisdom and knowledge,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:3	vd98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **wisdom** and **knowledge**, you can express the ideas behind these abstract nouns with adjectives such as “wise” and “knowledgeable.” Alternate translation: “of wise and knowledgeable thinking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:3	iiob		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως	1	The words **wisdom** and **knowledge** mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the breadth of spiritual wisdom. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word or translate **wisdom** as an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “of wisdom” or “of knowledge” or “of wise knowledge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:4	j8di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτο	1	The word **this** refers to what Paul has said in [2:2–3](../02/02.md) about the “secret.” If **this** would be misunderstood in your language, you could summarize what Paul has said instead of using **this**. Alternate translation: “these things about the secret” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:4	ksh8			μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς παραλογίζηται	1	Alternate translation: “people cannot deceive you”
2:4	y4r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πιθανολογίᾳ	1	The phrase **persuasive speech** refers to arguments that appear plausible. The phrase itself does not suggest that the arguments are true or false, but the context here suggests that the arguments are false even though they sound believable. If **persuasive speech** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or a short phrase that expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “plausible arguments” or “words that sound true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:5	ydw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	The word **For** introduces further support for why the Colossians should not be “deceived” ([2:4](../02/04.md)). Even if Paul is physically absent, he is thinking about them and caring for them. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could specify what the word **For** is supporting. Alternate translation: “This persuasive speech is false because,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:5	ubd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & καὶ	1	Paul speaks as if being “absent” were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language would not use a conditional statement for something that is a current fact, you could translate these words as an affirmation. Alternate translation: “while” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2:5	g1rp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῇ σαρκὶ ἄπειμι	1	In Paul’s culture, being **absent in the flesh** is a figurative way to speak about not being present in person. If **absent in the flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or translate the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I am not there with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:5	fz3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	The word **yet** introduces a contrast with “absent in the flesh.” While the Colossians might expect that, since Paul is “absent in the flesh,” he is also absent “in the spirit,” Paul says the opposite: he is with them “in the spirit.” Use a word that indicates contrast or contraexpectation in your language. Alternate translation: “despite this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:5	bz56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῷ πνεύματι σὺν ὑμῖν εἰμι	1	In Paul’s culture, being with someone **in the spirit** is a figurative way to speak of thinking about and caring about that person. If **with you in the spirit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I am still connected to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:5	yvvr			τῷ πνεύματι	1	Here, **the spirit** could refer to: (1) Paul’s spirit, which would be the part of him that rejoices over the Colossians from a distance. Alternate translation: “in my spirit” (2) the Holy Spirit, which connects Paul with the Colossians, even though they are not physically together. Alternate translation: “in God’s Spirit” or “by the power of God’s Spirit”
2:5	w0ye		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	χαίρων καὶ βλέπων	1	Here, **rejoicing and seeing** are what Paul does while he is with them “in the spirit.” If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make the relationship between the ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: (adding a period after “spirit”) “When I think about you, I rejoice and see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
2:5	t8mc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	χαίρων καὶ βλέπων	1	Paul here expresses a single idea with the two words **rejoicing** and **seeing**. He means that he “rejoices” when he “sees.” If **rejoicing and seeing** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **rejoicing** as an adverb or prepositional phrase. Alternate translation: “joyfully seeing” or “seeing with joy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
2:5	ev9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑμῶν τὴν τάξιν	1	The phrase **good order** refers to behavior that properly fits into a larger pattern or arrangement. In the context, that larger pattern is what God expects of his people. If **good order** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable term or translate the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “the fact that you behave according to God’s standards” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:5	hth1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ στερέωμα & πίστεως ὑμῶν	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe the Colossians’ **faith** as something that has **strength**. If your language does not use the possessive form to express this idea, you can express the idea by translating **strength** with an adjective such as “strong.” Alternate translation: “your strong faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:5	kw3x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ στερέωμα & πίστεως ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind the words **strength** and **faith**, you can express the ideas behind these abstract nouns in another way. Alternate translation: “how you strongly believe” or “the fact that you firmly believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:6	a6cr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	The word **Therefore** draws an inference or conclusion from what Paul has said in [2:1–5](../02/01.md), which includes the truth about Paul and the benefits that flow from knowing the Messiah. If **Therefore** by itself would be misunderstood in your language, you could specify from what does Paul draw his inference. Alternate translation: “Because of what I have told you about myself and about the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:6	wqwi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ὡς & παρελάβετε τὸν Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν τὸν Κύριον, ἐν αὐτῷ περιπατεῖτε,	1	Paul here draws a comparison between the way in which the Colossians **received** the Messiah and the way in which he wishes them to behave now. If your language would put the comparison second, you could reverse the two clauses. Alternate translation: “walk in Christ Jesus the Lord just as you received him” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
2:6	s99k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρελάβετε τὸν Χριστὸν	1	Paul says that the Colossians **received Christ** as if they had welcomed him into their homes or received him as a gift. What this means is that they believed in Jesus and the teachings about him. If **received Christ** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to coming to believe in Jesus, or you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you first believed in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:6	m3f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ περιπατεῖτε	1	This command does not require the Colossians to walk around inside Jesus. Rather, in Paul’s culture, to **walk** is a common metaphor for how people live their lives, and the words **in him** refer to being united to Christ. If **walk in him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a verb that refers to behavior in life and connect it with how you have translated “in Christ” elsewhere. Alternate translation: “act as those who are united to the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	e2x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐρριζωμένοι & ἐποικοδομούμενοι & βεβαιούμενοι & περισσεύοντες	1	Paul uses these four verbs to give examples of how the Colossians should “walk in” the Messiah ([2:6](../02/06.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could add a phrase that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “Walking in him entails being rooted … built up … confirmed … abounding” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:7	en3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐρριζωμένοι & ἐποικοδομούμενοι & βεβαιούμενοι	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you can translate all three of these words in their active forms with the Colossians as the subject. Alternate translation: “rooting yourselves … building yourselves up … having confidence” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:7	fw47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐρριζωμένοι & ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Paul wants the Colossians to be united so closely to Christ that he speaks of this union as if the Colossians were a plant with roots growing into Christ. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “being closely connected with … in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	tb5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἐποικοδομούμενοι ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Paul wants the Colossians to base everything they think and do on Christ as if they were a house built on Christ, who is the foundation. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in him, and basing everything you think and do on him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	yh83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βεβαιούμενοι τῇ πίστει	1	The word **confirmed** refers to something being sure or valid. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “sure about the faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:7	umcl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you can express the idea in a different way, such as with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “in what you believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:7	l1is		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδιδάχθητε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can translate this verb (1) in its active form with Epaphras as the subject (we know he was their teacher from [1:7](../01/07.md)) (2) with a verb such as “learned.” Alternate translation: “you learned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:7	j47d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	περισσεύοντες ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract for the idea behind **thanksgiving**, you can express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “being very thankful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	cbw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	βλέπετε, μή τις ὑμᾶς ἔσται ὁ συλαγωγῶν	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nPaul uses this clause to warn the Colossians against any person who wishes to take them captive. If your language does not use this form, you can simplify or restructure the clause so that it does not include both **someone** and **the one**. Alternate translation: “Beware lest anyone take you captive” or “Make sure that no one takes you captive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:8	ga9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμᾶς & ὁ συλαγωγῶν	1	Paul speaks of those who are trying to deceive the Colossians as if they were capturing the Colossians as prisoners. He uses this language to portray the false teachers as enemies who do not care about the Colossians but only want to use them for their own benefit. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “the one who convinces you to believe a lie” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:8	p3vx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης	1	The words **philosophy** and **empty deceit** work together to express one idea: human **philosophy** that is **empty** of content and deceitful. If your language does not use this form, you can combine the two nouns into one phrase, such as by using words like “meaningless” and “deceptive.” Alternate translation: “empty, deceitful philosophy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
2:8	nlws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς φιλοσοφίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **philosophy**, you can express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how humans understand the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	t8xx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κενῆς ἀπάτης	1	Paul speaks of deceitful **philosophy** as if it were a container that had nothing in it. He means that the deceitful **philosophy** has nothing important or meaningful to contribute. If **empty deceit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “valueless deceit” or “deceit with no content” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:8	l9jt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν παράδοσιν τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	The **tradition of men** refers to the ways in which humans behave that they learned from their families and pass on to their children. If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea of **tradition**, you can a phrase that refers to traditions that are passed on from parents to children. Alternate translation: “customary human thinking and behavior” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	oy49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the word **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If **men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “of humans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:8	jg16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου	1	The phrase **elemental teaching** could refer to (1) basic human opinions about how the world works. Alternate translation: “human worldviews” (2) the spiritual powers of this world. Alternate translation: “spiritual beings that rule the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:9	slg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	The word **for** introduces a reason why the Colossians need to watch out for anyone who provides teaching that is “not according to Christ” ([2:8](../02/08.md)): Christ is God and provides access to God. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make what Paul is supporting more explicit. Alternate translation: “You must beware of any teaching without Christ, because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:9	ahq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικεῖ πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς Θεότητος σωματικῶς	1	Paul speaks as if Jesus were a place in which complete divinity (**fullness of deity**) lives (**dwells**). This metaphor indicates that Jesus, who is human (**in bodily form**), is truly and fully God. If this metaphor does not indicate Jesus’ full divinity and full humanity in your language, you could express this idea with a metaphor that does indicate this or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “he is both fully God and fully man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:9	m529		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς Θεότητος	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **fullness** and **deity**, you can express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “everything that it means to be God” or “everything that belongs fully to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:10	oykt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	The word **and** introduces another reason why the Colossians need to watch out for anyone who provides teaching that is “not according to Christ” ([2:8](../02/08.md)): not only is Christ fully God ([2:9](../02/09.md)), but he provides the way in which the Colossians are filled with everything they need. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this link more explicit. Alternate translation: “and furthermore,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:10	lbk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐστὲ ἐν αὐτῷ πεπληρωμένοι	1	Here Paul speaks as if people were containers that are filled when they are united to Christ, which means that people receive everything they need, including salvation, in their union with Christ. The word **filled** is very similar to the word Paul used in [2:9](../02/09.md) for “fullness.” If your language uses similar words in these two sentences, you could use a word like the one you used in [2:9](../02/09.md). If not, you could express this idea in another way, using a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you lack nothing because of your union with the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:10	sbi0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐστὲ & πεπληρωμένοι	1	If in your language does not use this passive form, you can translate this verb in the active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has filled you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:10	je36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ κεφαλὴ πάσης ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας	1	The expression **head of** here refers to supremacy and authority over something or somebody. If **head** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively with another noun, such as “sovereign” or “ruler,” or a verb, such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “the sovereign over all rule and authority” or “the one who rules over all rule and authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:10	pwg2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πάσης ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας	1	The words **rule** and **authority** could refer to (1) powerful spiritual beings, as in [1:16](../01/16.md). Translate these words here as you translated them there. Alternate translation: “of all spirit beings who govern and rule” (2) anyone or anything with power and authority. Alternate translation: “of anyone with power and authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:11	xeq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	καὶ περιετμήθητε περιτομῇ ἀχειροποιήτῳ, ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός, ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses **circumcision** as an image to describe what happens to believers when they are united to the Messiah. In the metaphor, the **circumcision** is completed **without hands**, which means that God accomplishes it. What is “removed” or cut off is the **body of flesh**, which refers to the broken and sinful parts of the person. If this metaphor about **circumcision** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with the language of analogy or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you were also marked off by God as his own when he took away your body of flesh by the work of the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:11	f6ek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ καὶ περιετμήθητε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can translate this verb in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “in whom God also circumcised you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:11	ii43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **removal**, you can express the idea with a verb such as “remove.” Alternate translation: “when he removed the body of flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:11	m3xu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to connect **circumcision** with **Christ**. This does not refer to when Christ himself was circumcised or how he himself circumcises believers. Instead, the possessive form connects the extended metaphor of circumcision with Christ’s work: the circumcision that Paul speaks about is accomplished in what Christ has done. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you can make the relationship between **circumcision** and **Christ** more explicit. Alternate translation: “in the circumcision accomplished by Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:11	fw80		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the word **Christ** to refer primarily to what **Christ** has accomplished. If your language does not use a person’s name to identify something that they have done, you can clarify that Paul is speaking of the “work” **of Christ**. Alternate translation: “that comes from what Christ did” or “that Christ’s work accomplished” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:12	ln8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνταφέντες αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ βαπτισμῷ	1	Paul here uses a metaphor that connects **baptism** to “burial” to further explain what happens to believers when they are united to Christ. This metaphor expresses how, when they are baptized, believers are united to Christ in his (death and) burial and are no longer who they once were. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with the language of analogy, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having been united with the Messiah in his burial when you were baptized” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	s2a0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	συνταφέντες	1	Here Paul refers only to being **buried**, but he also implies “dying.” If **buried** would not include the idea of “dying” in your language, you could include “dying” in your translation. Alternate translation: “having died and been buried with” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:12	r8l8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνταφέντες αὐτῷ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can translate this phrase in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God burying you with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:12	g1rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ᾧ & συνηγέρθητε	1	Paul here explains that believers are not only united to Christ in his burial but also in his resurrection. It is by being united to him in his resurrection that believers receive new life. If believers being **raised up** now would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in union with the Messiah in his resurrection you received new life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	yp7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνηγέρθητε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can translate the idea in its active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God raised you up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:12	rec6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	συνηγέρθητε & τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Paul uses the words **raised up** and **raised him from the dead** to refer to someone who had died and then came back to life. If your language does not use these words to describe coming back to life, use a comparable idiom or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “you were restored to life … who restored him to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:12	oo6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς πίστεως τῆς ἐνεργείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **faith** and **power**, you can express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “because you trusted in the powerful God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:12	j4uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “among the dead people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
2:13	oxde		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὑμᾶς νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν, συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul begins the sentence with **you**, and then he restates **you** when he identifies what God has done for **you**. If your language would not restate **you** or use this structure, you could separate the two uses of **you** into separate sentences. Alternate translation: “you were dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. Then, he made you alive together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:13	c40c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1	This clause does not refer to the current situation of the Colossians, but rather it describes their situation before God acted to make them alive, as expressed in the rest of the verse. If the time of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that this clause describes a time before **he made you alive**. Alternate translation: “who used to be dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
2:13	v6vi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμᾶς νεκροὺς ὄντας	1	Paul speaks of people who are without Christ as if they were dead. By this he means that those who lack any relationship with God and are not united to Christ are spiritually dead. If calling the Colossians **dead** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul speaks of spiritual death or express the idea with a simile, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you, being like dead people” or “you, being totally separated from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:13	emdw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1	When Paul speaks of someone **being dead in** something, this identifies both why and in what state the person is dead. In other words, the Colossians were **dead** because of their **trespasses** and because of their **uncircumcision**, and these things also characterized them while they were dead. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a phrase like “because of,” or you could translate **trespasses** and **uncircumcision** as descriptors of **dead**. Alternate translation: “being dead because of your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh” or “being dead, that is, trespassing God’s commands and being uncircumcised in your flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:13	pphm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1	Here, **uncircumcision** could refer (1) to how the Colossians were not circumcised Jews and thus not part of God’s people. Alternate translation: “among the non-Jews without God’s promises” (2) to the metaphor about circumcision in [2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: “apart from God’s saving work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:13	gdke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **flesh** that has not been “circumcised.” If your language does not express this idea with the possessive form, you can translate **uncircumcision** as an adjective. Alternate translation: “your uncircumcised flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:13	f9ms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς σὺν αὐτῷ	1	Here Paul speaks of God’s work in restoring people to himself as if he brought these people back to life physically. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul speaks of spiritual life or express the idea with a simile or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “he did something like making you alive together with him” or “he restored you to proper relationship with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:13	upyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς σὺν αὐτῷ	1	The word **he** refers to God the Father, while the word translated **him** refers to God the Son. If these pronouns would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify the antecedent of one or both of these pronouns. Alternate translation: “he made you alive together with the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:14	w22z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξαλείψας τὸ καθ’ ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον τοῖς δόγμασιν, ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν, καὶ αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου, προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ;	1	Paul speaks of the way God forgives our sins as if God **canceled** debts that we owed him. In the metaphor, God has crossed out or erased the **written record** of those debts and thus removed any impact these debts have on our relationship to him. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having taken away the guilt from our sins, he has kept those sins from impacting our relationship with him, having nailed them to the cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	k0fg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	καθ’ ἡμῶν & ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν	1	The phrases **against us** and **opposed to us** might be considered redundant in your language. If this is the case, you could combine the two phrases into one. Alternate translation: “which were opposed to us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:14	phgg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου	1	Paul speaks as if the **written record** was within the community of believers, and God takes it away. What he means by this is that the **written record** of our sins no longer affects our relationship with God and each other. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “he has kept it from affecting our relationship with him and others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:14	o5mx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ	1	Here Paul speaks as if God had nailed the “written record” to the cross. He means that Christ’s death on the cross “canceled” the “written record” as surely as if it had been nailed to the cross and died with Christ. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea using a simile, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “destroying it through the Messiah’s death on the cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:15	gh24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπεκδυσάμενος & ἐδειγμάτισεν ἐν παρρησίᾳ & θριαμβεύσας	1	Here Paul speaks of God’s victory over powerful spiritual beings in terms that fit with what a conqueror often did to his prisoners in Paul’s culture. He would make a **public spectacle** or example of them, “stripping” them of their clothes and forcing them to parade behind him in his “triumph.” If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express these ideas with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having defeated … he showed everyone that he had conquered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:15	pbkm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας	1	Just as in [1:16](../01/16.md) and [2:10](../02/10.md), the **rulers** and **authorities** could refer to (1) powerful spiritual beings that rule this world. Alternate translation: “the spiritual powers, including those known as rulers and authorities” (2) anybody or anything that rules and has authority. Alternate translation: “those who rule with authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:15	h7kx			ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Alternate translation: “by the cross” or “through the cross”
2:15	cg37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	αὐτῷ	1	Here Paul uses **the cross** to refer to Christ’s death on the cross. If the meaning of **cross** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include a word or a phrase which includes Christ’s death. Alternate translation: “the Messiah’s death on the cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:16	bvs7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	The word **Therefore** draws an inference or conclusion from what Paul has already said, which can be found in [2:9–15](../02/09.md): in the work of Christ, the Colossians have received new life and the powers that rule this world have been defeated. Because of these things that have happened, the Colossians should not allow others to judge them in how they behave. Paul is continuing the warning against false teachers that he started in [2:8](../02/08.md). If these connections would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to these ideas more explicitly or use a comparable transition word or phrase. Alternate translation: “In light of all these things” or “Given the Messiah’s sufficient work on your behalf” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:16	e1rp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μὴ & τις ὑμᾶς κρινέτω	1	This phrase translates a third-person imperative. If your language has third-person imperatives, you could use one here. If your language does not have third-person imperatives, you can use a comparable phrase or express the idea with a second-person imperative. Alternate translation: “you should not let anyone judge you” or “do not permit anyone to judge you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
2:16	cii9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν βρώσει, καὶ ἐν πόσει, ἢ ἐν μέρει ἑορτῆς, ἢ νουμηνίας, ἢ Σαββάτων	1	This list of areas in which someone might judge the Colossians refers to parts of the law of Moses. Some of these areas were also important for other religions in Paul’s culture. If Paul’s list of things that someone could **judge** the Colossians in would be misunderstood in your translation, you could clarify that these areas are covered by the law of Moses and sometimes by the traditions of other religions as well. Alternate translation: “for you how behave in relationship to the law of Moses and other religious traditions, including in the areas of food and drink and festivals, new moons or Sabbaths.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:16	b4kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	νουμηνίας	1	The word **new moon** refers to a festival or celebration that would take place when it was the time of the new moon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression or translate the idea with a longer phrase. Alternate translation: “a new moon celebration” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:17	ip3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἅ ἐστιν σκιὰ τῶν μελλόντων, τὸ δὲ σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	A **shadow** shows the shape and outline of a **body**, but it is not the **body** itself. In a similar way, the things listed in the previous verse show the shape and outline of the **things coming**, but the **body** that casts this **shadow** is **Christ**. He is the substance of the **things coming**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “which are a foretaste of the things coming, but the full experience is of Christ” or “which hint at the things that were to come, but Christ is the one who came” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:17	sev8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	σκιὰ τῶν μελλόντων	1	Paul here uses the possession form to show that the **shadow** is cast by the **things coming**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express this idea, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a shadow cast by the things coming” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:17	liqe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν μελλόντων	1	The **things coming** primarily refers to things that will happen or be experienced in the future. They can be connected with both the first and the second coming of Christ, which is why the **body** is of Christ in this verse. If that meaning of **coming** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **coming** refers to what Christ has blessed believers with at his first coming and what he will bless them with at his second coming. Alternate translation: “blessings that Christ brings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:17	ykh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ & σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify **Christ** as the **body** that casts the “shadow.” If your language would not use the possessive form to express this idea, you could express the idea with a simple “being” verb. Alternate translation: “the body is Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:18	aa4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	μηδεὶς & ἑόρακεν & αὐτοῦ	1	The words **no one**, **he**, and **his** do not refer to one male person. Instead, they refer in a generic way to anyone who acts in these ways. If the meaning of these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate these words with a comparable generic phrase in your language or make them plural. Alternate translation: “no one … they have seen … their” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:18	ontu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς καταβραβευέτω	1	This phrase translates a third-person imperative. If your language has third-person imperatives, you could use one here. If your language does not, you can use a comparable phrase or express the idea with a second-person imperative. Alternate translation: “Do not allow anyone … deprive you of your prize” or “Be on your guard against anyone … so that he does not deprive you of your prize” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
2:18	zv2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς καταβραβευέτω	1	Here Paul refers to the false teachers as if they were judges or umpires at a contest who could decide against the Colossians, thus keeping them from receiving the prize for winning the contest. This metaphor fits with the “judging” language in [2:16](../02/16.md). These two verses together suggest that the Colossians are tempted to choose the false teachers as their judges instead of Christ. If these figures of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Let no one … act instead of Christ as your judge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:18	b5ce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ταπεινοφροσύνῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **humility**, you can express the idea in another way, such as with a verb. Alternate translation: “humbling themselves falsely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:18	pmcn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	θρησκείᾳ τῶν ἀγγέλων	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe the act of worshiping angels, not the worship that angels present to God. If **worship of the angels** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify with a phrase such as “presented to.” Alternate translation: “worship presented to the angels” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:18	kn5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐμβατεύων	1	Here Paul speaks as if the false teachers were **standing** on “things they have seen.” This metaphor means that they talk about what they have seen and base teachings on it. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate **standing** with a verb that expresses this idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “constantly talking about” or “basing his teaching on” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:18	p67q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἃ ἑόρακεν	1	In the context of angel worship, **things he has seen** refers to visions and dreams that reveal powerful beings, heaven, the future, or other secrets. If these implications would not be understood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to these kinds of visions or dreams or use a phrase to express the idea. Alternate translation: “things he has seen in visions” or “secrets revealed to him in visions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:18	p7q4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰκῇ φυσιούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can translate the phrase in its active form. Alternate translation: “the mind of his flesh puffing him up without cause” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:18	wp42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φυσιούμενος	1	Here Paul describes people who boast as if they had made themselves larger by filling themselves with air. He means that they think of themselves as more important than they really are. If **becoming puffed up** would not mean “becoming prideful” in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “becoming self-important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:18	zz4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **mind**, you can express this idea by using a verb such as “think.” Alternate translation: “by how he thinks in fleshly ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:18	if94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak of a **mind** that belongs to the **flesh**. This phrase refers to thinking that is characterized by the flesh in its weakness and sinfulness. If your language does not use the possessive form to express that idea, you can express the idea by translating **flesh** as an adjective. Alternate translation: “his fleshly mind” or “his weak and sinful mind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:19	m2dz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ κρατῶν τὴν κεφαλήν	1	Paul describes the false teachers as if they had let go of the **head**, which is Christ. This means that they have stopped treating Christ as the source and authority behind their teaching. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or translate the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “not staying connected to the head” or “not treating the head, which is Christ, as most important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:19	r4ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	τὴν κεφαλήν, ἐξ οὗ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων ἐπιχορηγούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον, αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	In this verse Paul uses an extended metaphor in which Christ is the **head** of the **body**, which is his church, which has **joints** and **ligaments**, and which **grows**. Paul uses this metaphor to describe how Christ leads, directs, nourishes, and unifies his church to help it become what he wants it to be. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea using the language of analogy, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “to the Messiah, from whom the whole church receives nourishment and leadership and in whom the church is united as it grows with the growth from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
2:19	i2yd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐξ οὗ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων ἐπιχορηγούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the sentence in active form. Alternate translation: “which supplies and holds the whole body together throughout the joints and ligaments” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:19	qnsp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων	1	The word **joints** refers to where parts of the body are connected together, while the word translated **ligaments** refers to what holds these parts together. If these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could use technical terms that correspond to **joints** and **ligaments**, or you could use more general language for what holds the body together. Alternate translation: “what holds it together” or “all its parts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:19	wcds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν	1	The words **grows** and **growth** are directly related and may be redundant in your language. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can use just one form of “grow.” Alternate translation: “experiences the growth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:19	n3y4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul here speaks of **growth** that is **from God** to show that the church’s **growth** is given by **God** and fits with what **God** desires. If your language would not use this form to express that idea, you could express the idea with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “with the growth that God gives” or “with the growth that God enables” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:20	cpki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, then you can translate the clause as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you died with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
2:20	yg7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ	1	Paul now returns to a metaphor he has used earlier: believers have died and “been buried with” Christ ([2:12](../02/12.md)). This means that, in their union with Christ, believers share in his death so that they too have died. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the language of analogy, or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you participated in the Messiah’s death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	oshk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ ἀπὸ	1	To “die from” something does not identify what caused the death, but rather it indicates what the death separated the person from. Here, then, the Colossians were separated from the **elemental principles** by participating in Christ’s death. If “dying” **from** something would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “you died with Christ, which separated you from” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:20	ydqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν στοιχείων τοῦ κόσμου	1	As in [2:8](../02/08.md), the word **elemental principles** could refer to (1) the spiritual powers of this world. Alternate translation: “the powerful spiritual beings in this world” (2) basic human opinions about how the world works. Alternate translation: “the basic things that humans teach about the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:20	uu77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τί ὡς ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ δογματίζεσθε	1	If this structure would be difficult to understand in your language, you could move the phrase **as living in the world** to the end of the sentence. Alternate translation: “why are you being subjected to the world’s decrees as living in the world” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
2:20	ywkx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ	1	Paul uses the verb **living** to describe the Colossian’s way of life. They are indeed physically alive and in the world, but he wants them to behave in ways that do not match what people **in the world** normally do. If **living in the world** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a verbal phrase such as “belonging to” or “conforming to.” Alternate translation: “belonging to the world” or “conforming to the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:20	xm1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ὡς ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ	1	In this context, the word **as** introduces something that is not true: the Colossians do not actually live **in the world**. If **as** would be misunderstood your language, you could clarify that **living in the world** is not true of the Colossians, using a phrase such as “as if.” Alternate translation: “as if living in the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
2:20	fe1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ὡς ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ δογματίζεσθε	1	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. Here, there is no answer to the question, since that is exactly Paul’s point. There is no reason for them to be **subjected to its decrees**. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an imperative or a “should” statement. Alternate translation: “do not, as living in the world, be subjected to its decrees” or “you should not, as living in the world, be subjected to its decrees” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:20	g0jz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δογματίζεσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in its active form, perhaps by using a similar verb. Alternate translation: “do you submit to its decrees” or “do you subject yourselves to its decrees” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:20	cdgc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δογματίζεσθε	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **decrees**, you can express the idea with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “are you being subjected to what people require” or “are you being subjected to what it commands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:21	v9e7			Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThis verse gives three commands that are not from Paul, but rather they are examples of the “decrees” from [2:20](../02/20.md). If these commands would be misunderstood in your language, you could introduce these commands with a phrase, such as “for example,” that shows that they connect to the “decrees” in the previous verse.
2:21	pzj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἅψῃ & γεύσῃ & θίγῃς	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThese commands are addressed to **You** in the singular. Most likely, Paul refers to specific commands given to one person in a specific situation. However, he does intend these to be taken as examples of commands that might be given to any person among the Colossians. If your language can use a command in the singular as a generic example, you could do so here. If this does not make sense in your language, you could use plural commands here. Alternate translation: “You all may … handle … taste … touch” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2:21	b392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ ἅψῃ! μηδὲ γεύσῃ! μηδὲ θίγῃς!	1	Paul does not express what these commands say not to **handle**, **taste**, or **touch**, but it is clear that only certain things would be included, not all things. If your language would make this information explicit, you could add a generic phrase such as “certain things” or use words that match each command. Alternate translation: “You may not handle certain objects, nor taste certain foods and drinks, nor touch certain people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:22	a25u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἅ	1	This pronoun refers to the commands in the previous verse, especially focusing on the implied objects of the rules. If **which** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a noun or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “The things that these commands regulate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:22	ogj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐστιν πάντα εἰς φθορὰν τῇ ἀποχρήσει	1	This phrase means that all the objects that the commands in the previous verse are about end up being destroyed when they are used. In other words, food and drink are destroyed when they are eaten, and tools eventually break when they are used. By describing the objects in this way, Paul shows that the rules about these objects are not very important. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this phrasemore clearly, such as with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “all end up in destruction because of their use” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:22	cmnf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς φθορὰν τῇ ἀποχρήσει	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **destruction** and **use**, you can express the idea by using verbs. Alternate translation: “destroyed when they are used” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:22	klsg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ἐντάλματα καὶ διδασκαλίας τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Paul here uses the possessive form to describe **commands and teachings** that come from **men**. If your language does not use the possessive form to express that idea, you can clarify that these teachings “come from” **men**. Alternate translation: “the commands and teachings that come from men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:22	d4lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὰ ἐντάλματα καὶ διδασκαλίας τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **commands** and **teachings**, you can express the idea by using verbs. Alternate translation: “what men command and teach” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:22	oqmf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the word **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether men or women. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “of men and women” or “of humans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:23	r2m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	λόγον μὲν ἔχοντα σοφίας	1	Commands that have **a word of wisdom** are commands that come from wise thinking or require wise behavior. If this **having indeed a word of wisdom** would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idiom with a comparable expression, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “are indeed characterized by wisdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:23	h2hk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγον	1	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “a message” or “a lesson” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:23	y2dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἅτινά & λόγον μὲν ἔχοντα σοφίας ἐν ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ καὶ ταπεινοφροσύνῃ, ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος	1	While there is no grammatical marker for a condition here, the word **in** functionally introduces a condition: these commands have a **word of wisdom** “if” one values **self-made religion and false humility and severity of the body**. It is only if one values these things that the commands have wisdom. If Paul’s explanation of how these commands could have **wisdom** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using a conditional expression, or use the word “seem.” Alternate translation: “which, having indeed a word of wisdom if one values self-made religion and false humility and severity of the body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
2:23	g60j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	λόγον μὲν ἔχοντα σοφίας ἐν ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ καὶ ταπεινοφροσύνῃ, ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος,	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **wisdom**, **religion**, **humility**, and **severity**, you can rephrase this part of the verse so that you can express these ideas with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “having indeed a word that seems wise according to people who serve God in their own way, who humble themselves for gain, and who act severely to their bodies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:23	vr8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ	1	The phrase **self-made religion** could describe (1) people who worship God however they want to. Alternate translation: “invented religion” (2) people who pretend to worship God but do not. Alternate translation: “mock worship” or “false worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:23	g9i8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος	1	The phrase **severity of the body** refers to treating one’s body harshly as part of one’s religious practice. This could include beating oneself, not eating enough, or other ascetic practices. If **severity of the body** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that refers to religious practice or translate the idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “and wounding one’s body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:23	e7p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐστιν & οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **value**, you can combine it with the verbal phrase **are not** to create a new phrase. Alternate translation: “do nothing” or “are ineffective” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:23	blil		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός	1	Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **indulgence** one gives to the **flesh**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express this idea, you could translate **indulgence** with a verb such as “indulging.” Alternate translation: “indulging the flesh.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:23	e70e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός	1	If one “indulges” **the flesh**, this means that one has behaved in ways that match what one’s weak and sinful parts wish. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word for “sin.” Alternate translation: “sin” or “giving in to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:23	k3x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **indulgence**, you can use a verb, such as “indulge.” Alternate translation: “indulging the flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:intro	qtl2				0	# Colossians 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n[4:1](../04/01.md) belongs to the section that begins in [3:18](../03/18.md), even though it is in the next chapter.\n\n3. Exhortation Section\n    * Seek the Things Above (3:1–4)\n    * Take off Vices, Put on Virtues (3:5–17)\n    * Commands for the Household (3:18–4:1)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Old and new “man”\n\nPaul refers to the old and new “man” in [3:9–10](../03/09.md). These terms refer to the person before (“old”) and after (“new”) dying and rising with Christ. With these key words, Paul makes a similar claim to what he argued in [2:11–13](../02/11.md): believers are not who they used to be; rather, they have received new life in Christ and are new people. Your translation should reflect the idea that Paul tells the Colossians that they are new people in their union with Christ.\n\n### The wrath of God\n\nIn [3:6](../03/06.md), Paul speaks of the “wrath of God,” which is “coming.” God’s “wrath” is not primarily an emotion, but rather, it is his act of judgment on those who do not believe and who disobey. It is “coming” because God will act in judgment soon. In your translation, emphasize God’s act over his emotion.\n\n### No Greek and Jew … \n\nIn [3:11](../03/11.md), Paul refers to multiple different ways to categorize people in his world. See the notes on that verse for details. Paul says that none of these categories exist in the “new man.” By this, he means that these categories are not relevant for those who have died and risen with Christ. It is one’s status as a “new” person that is relevant and important.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Christ, your life\n\nIn [3:4](../03/04.md), Paul identifies Christ as the Colossians’ “life.” This metaphor comes from the previous verse, where Paul says that the Colossians’ life is “hidden with Christ.” Since their life is in Christ, Christ can be called their life. To say this a different way, the Colossians only have life in Christ, so their life and Christ’s life are bound together.\n\n### Avoiding vices, pursuing virtues\n\nIn his exhortation to the Colossians to avoid vices and pursue virtues, Paul uses a number of metaphors. For avoiding vices, he uses the language of “putting to death” ([3:5](../03/05.md)), “laying aside” ([3:8](../03/08.md)), and “taking off” ([3:9](../03/09.md)). All these metaphors require separation from vices, whether that is pictured as putting to death parts of the body that pursue vices or as taking off evil desires as if they were clothing. For pursuing virtues, he opposes “taking off” with “putting on” ([3:10](../03/10.md); [3:12](../03/12.md)). Just as the Colossians should “take off” the desire to pursue vices, they should “put on” the desire to pursue virtues. These metaphors are all intended to help the Colossians pursue virtue instead of vice.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Vice and virtue lists\n\nIn [3:5](../03/05.md) and [3:8](../03/08.md), Paul gives lists of vices. These lists are not meant to provide a complete catalog of immoral and evil behaviors. Instead, they provide some examples that are meant to show the Colossians the kinds of behaviors that Paul has in mind. In [3:12](../03/12.md), he provides a corresponding list of virtues. The same thinking applies here: this is not a complete catalog of correct or good behavior but instead gives examples of the kinds of things that Paul wants the Colossians to do. You could introduce these lists as examples if it would help your readers understand.\n\n### The “household code”\n\nIn [3:18](../03/18.md)–[4:1](../04/01.md), Paul uses a form that was well-known in his culture. It is often called a “household code,” and it consists of a list of instructions to different members of the household, including parents, children, slaves, and others. Paul uses this form and gives his own specific instructions to members of the household. Of course, he is not addressing a household but a church. He gives his instructions to whomever in the audience was a parent or a child or a slave.
3:1	r5yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	The word **therefore** introduces an exhortation based on what Paul has already said about being “raised with Christ” in [2:12](../02/12.md). Use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or concluding command based on what has already been said. Alternate translation: “then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:1	oav8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & συνηγέρθητε τῷ Χριστῷ	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since … you were raised with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:1	t1jv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συνηγέρθητε τῷ Χριστῷ	1	Paul again states that believers have been raised from the dead with Christ. By this, he means that believers are united to Christ in his resurrection and thus receive new life. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in union with the Messiah in his resurrection you received new life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:1	qmzv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	συνηγέρθητε	1	Paul uses the word **raised** to refer to someone who had died coming back to life. If this word does not refer to coming back to life in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “you were restored to life with” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:1	sl1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνηγέρθητε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God the Father raised you with” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:1	vuct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ ἄνω ζητεῖτε	1	Here Paul speaks as if he wants the Colossians to look for or try to find **things above**. By using the word **seek**, Paul wants to tell the Colossians to focus on **the things above** as if they were something valuable that the Colossians had lost and needed to find. If **seek the things above** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “direct your attention to the things above” or “focus on the things above” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:1	p3fw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰ ἄνω	1	The **things above** is another term for heavenly things, which Paul makes clear in the next phrase. If **the things above** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that the phrase refers specifically to things in heaven. Alternate translation: “the heavenly things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:1	upi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ Θεοῦ καθήμενος	1	This phrase implies two things. First, what Christ sits on is the divine throne in heaven. Second, **sitting** on this throne means that Christ has assumed a position of authority over the universe with God the Father. If **sitting at the right hand of God** would be misunderstood in your language, you could make either or both of these points explicit. Alternate translation: “sitting on the throne at the right hand of God” or “ruling at the right hand of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:2	vpat			φρονεῖτε	1	The phrase **think about** refers not just to reasoning but also to focus and desire. Alternate translation: “Focus on”
3:2	f181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰ ἄνω	1	Just as in [3:1](../03/01.md), the **things above** is another term for heavenly things. If **the things above** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that the phrase refers specifically to things in heaven. Alternate translation: “the heavenly things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:2	ow7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1	The **things on the earth** describes those things in this world that are not connected to Christ, which are not **the things above**. Not thinking about **the things on the earth** does not mean that the Colossians are supposed to abandon all care for earthly things. Instead, Paul is urging them to focus on Christ and what he has promised for them, not on whatever they could gain on earth. If the meaning of **the things on the earth** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify this contrast by further describing **the things on the earth**. Alternate translation: “the things that matter in this world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:3	oa5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	The word **for** introduces the reason why the Colossians should think about the things above ([3:1–2](../03/01.md)): it is because they **have died**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the transition more explicitly. Alternate translation: “You should think about the things above because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:3	l9yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπεθάνετε	1	Here Paul expresses in slightly different form the idea he already stated in [2:20](../02/20.md): the Colossians have been united to Christ in his death. As Christ actually died, so God counts the Colossian believers as having **died** with Christ. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idea as you did in [2:20](../02/20.md), or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you died in union with the Messiah” or “you participated in the Messiah’s death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:3	gkz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν κέκρυπται σὺν τῷ Χριστῷ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ	1	Here Paul speaks as if the Colossians’ lives were objects that could be **hidden** where Christ is, and as if the place they were hidden was God. By using this metaphor, Paul wants the Colossians to know that they are safe (**with Christ in God**) but also that their new life is not yet fully revealed (**hidden**). If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God is protecting your new life with Christ and will reveal it when the time comes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:3	xetc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν κέκρυπται σὺν τῷ Χριστῷ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “God has hidden your life with Christ in himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:3	ihr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν κέκρυπται	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **life**, you can rephrase the sentence so that you can use a verb for “living.” Alternate translation: “you live in a hidden way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:4	ugge		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ Χριστὸς φανερωθῇ, ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can translate the idea in active form with: (1) Christ as the subject. Alternate translation: “Christ, your life, reveals himself” or “Christ, your life, appears” (2) God the Father as the subject. Alternate translation: “God the Father reveals Christ, your life,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:4	n4nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν	1	Continuing the theme of the Colossians’ life being hidden with Christ, Paul now identifies Christ as the Colossians’ **life**. In other words, if the Colossians’ life is hidden with Christ, then Christ can be called their **life**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “who holds your life” or “with whom you have life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:4	kpqf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **life**, you can express the idea with a verb for “living.” Alternate translation: “in whom you live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:4	b2io		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	φανερωθῇ & σὺν αὐτῷ φανερωθήσεσθε	1	Paul uses the word **is revealed** to refer to Christ’s second coming, when he is **revealed** to everyone as who he truly is. Paul uses the phrase **will be revealed with him** to refer to how the Colossians will participate with Christ in that second coming and also be **revealed** as who they truly are. If the meaning of **revealed** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use words such as “coming” or “returning” instead of “revealing.” Alternate translation: “comes again … will come with him” or “returns … will return with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:4	vlxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὅταν & τότε	1	The word **when** indicates a moment in time, and the word translated **then** refers back to that same time. Therefore, the events described in two parts of this sentence occur at the same time. Use a construction that indicates simultaneous time in your language. Alternate translation: “When … at the same time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
3:4	mz6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐν δόξῃ	1	As a previous note pointed out, the “revealing” language suggests that something will be revealed about Christ and the Colossians. Here, Paul describes it as **glory**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that this is one thing that **is revealed** about Christ and the Colossians: they are glorious. Alternate translation: “as glorious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:4	ajcy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **glory**, you can express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as very great” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:5	xvsp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	Here, the word **therefore** introduces an exhortation based on previous statements. In this case, Paul bases his exhortation on what he has said about the Colossians’ union with Christ and its end goal: being revealed with him in glory. If the meaning of **therefore** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable connecting word or express the idea with a phrase that refers back to what Paul has already said. Alternate translation: “because of your union with Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:5	jl45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	νεκρώσατε οὖν	1	If your language would normally put a transition word like **therefore** at the beginning of the sentence, you could move it there in your translation. Alternate translation: “Therefore, put to death” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
3:5	zn6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	νεκρώσατε & τὰ μέλη τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1	Here Paul speaks of the **members** as if they were people that one could kill or **put to death**. By using this metaphor, he wants to show the Colossians that the evil desires he lists should be treated as enemies and dealt with as harshly as possible. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Eliminate … the members that are on the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	gdz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ μέλη τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1	Paul here speaks of sins as if they were **members** or limbs of the body that are part of the person **on the earth**. What this metaphor means is that these sins can be so much a part of a person while they are living on earth that getting rid of them is like cutting off an arm or leg. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the sins that have become part of you while you live on earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	pu2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πορνείαν, ἀκαθαρσίαν, πάθος, ἐπιθυμίαν κακήν, καὶ τὴν πλεονεξίαν, ἥτις ἐστὶν εἰδωλολατρία;	1	If your language would not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **immorality**, **uncleanness**, **passion**, **desire**, **envy**, and **idolatry**, you could rephrase this sentence and use adjectives or verbs to express the idea. Alternate translation: “behaving in ways that are sexually immoral, unclean, wrongly emotional, lustful, and envious, which is idolatrous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:5	p9w9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀκαθαρσίαν	1	The word **uncleanness** describes morally dirty or impure behavior. This is a general term that covers many sins that would make one unclean, that is, that would make other people avoid one. If you have a comparable expression in your language, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “unclean behavior” or “disgusting acts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:5	e65k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πάθος	1	The word **passion** refers to negative emotions that are triggered by outside events. Examples would include forms of anger and jealousy. If **passion** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that these are improper emotions, since Paul is not saying that all emotions are wrong. Alternate translation: “improper emotions” or “evil passions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:5	l9rv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπιθυμίαν κακήν	1	The word **desire** refers to longing after something, often in a sexual context. If **evil desire** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “evil lust” or “evil longing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:5	h5v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν πλεονεξίαν	1	Here Paul uses the word **envy** to refer to wanting more than one needs, especially wanting more than what others have. If you have a comparable term, you could use if here, or you could express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “desiring to have more than what others have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:5	j4n0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἥτις	1	Here, **which** refers back to **envy** only, not to other items in the list. If what **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it refers to **envy**. Alternate translation: “and envy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:6	wm23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἔρχεται	1	Many ancient manuscripts include “on the sons of disobedience” after **is coming**. Several early and reliable manuscripts do not include it, however. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include these words if that translation includes them. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of the ULT and not include these words. The phrase “sons of disobedience” is an idiom that refers to people who disobey. Alternate translation: “is coming against people who disobey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
3:6	dj6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	δι’ ἃ	1	With this phrase, Paul identifies the sins listed in the previous verse as the reason why God’s “wrath” is coming. If what the pronoun **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify this idea by including a word such as “sins” in the phrase. Alternate translation: “because of which sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:6	s9lm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks of **the wrath of God** as if it were a person or package that can arrive somewhere. By this, he means that God has not yet acted upon his **wrath** but that he will act soon. The Colossians can expect **the wrath** to come soon, just like a package that is arriving soon. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God will act upon his wrath soon” or “the wrath of God will be enacted soon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:6	ygaj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ,	1	When the **wrath of God** “comes,” it must arrive somewhere and be against certain people. If you would explicitly state these things in your language, you could clarify that the **wrath** of God comes on earth and against those who do the sins listed in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the wrath of God is coming on earth against those who do these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:6	xb24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ,	1	The **wrath of God** does not refer simply to an emotion. Rather, this phrase primarily refers to God acting against the sin he hates (examples of which appear in the previous verse). If **wrath** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates action and not just emotion. Alternate translation: “punishment from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:7	u4p6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν οἷς	1	The word **which** refers again back to the list of sins in [3:5](../03/05.md). If what **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could include the word “sins” to clarify this reference. Alternate translation: “in which sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:7	p4q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν οἷς καὶ ὑμεῖς περιεπατήσατέ ποτε	1	Paul speaks of behavior that is characteristic of one’s life as if it were something that one could “walk in.” By this, he means that the sinful behaviors were things that they normally did. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “which formerly characterized your lives too” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:7	jz5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περιεπατήσατέ ποτε	1	The word **formerly** is used to refer to some indefinite time in the past. Here Paul uses it to refer to the time before the Colossians believed in Jesus. If **formerly** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify the specific time reference. Alternate translation: “walked before you believed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	jsfs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὅτε	1	The word **when** introduces a clause that occurs simultaneously with the main clause. Here, the Colossians “lived” **in them** at the same time as they were “walking” in them. Use an expression that indicates simultaneous time in your language. Alternate translation: “at the time when” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
3:7	s824		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐζῆτε ἐν τούτοις	1	The phrase **living in** something could mean (1) that the Colossians practiced these sins in addition to having lives characterized by them (“walking in them”). Alternate translation: “you were doing these things” (2) that the Colossians were living among people who did these things. Alternate translation: “you were living among people who did these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:7	pw57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν οἷς καὶ ὑμεῖς περιεπατήσατέ ποτε ὅτε ἐζῆτε ἐν τούτοις.	1	If **which** and **them** both refer to the sins mentioned in [3:5](../03/05.md), then “walking” and **living** in them mean very similar things. Paul uses the repetition to emphasize how thoroughly the Colossians’ lives were characterized by sins. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one phrase for this concept, you can use just one of these phrases. Alternate translation: “in which you also formerly walked” or “in which you used to live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:8	k2dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	νυνὶ δὲ	1	The phrase **but now** introduces a contrast with the previous verse, a contrast that focuses on time. The word translated **now** refers to the time after the Colossians believed. It introduces how they should behave **now** in contrast to how they behaved “formerly” ([3:7](../03/07.md)). If this contrast would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what **now** refers to. Alternate translation: “But now that you believe in Jesus,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
3:8	l019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπόθεσθε	1	Here Paul exhorts the Colossians to **lay aside** sins as if the sins were garments that they could take off or objects they could set down and stop using. By talking this way, Paul encourages the Colossians to no longer use or be associated with sins that are not part of who they are in their union with Christ, just as clothes and objects are not part of the person but can be removed. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “must … separate yourselves from” or “must … no longer do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:8	zltd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὀργήν, θυμόν, κακίαν, βλασφημίαν, αἰσχρολογίαν ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind these words, you can express the ideas by using verbs or adjectives. Alternate translation: “wrathful, angry, and lustful behavior, and slanderous and obscene words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:8	ahhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὀργήν, θυμόν	1	The words **wrath** and **anger** are almost synonymous, with **wrath** emphasizing angry actions and **anger** emphasizing angry emotions. If your language does not have two words for “anger” that work here, you can express the idea with one word. Alternate translation: “anger” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:8	d3wr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κακίαν	1	The phrase **evil desire** is a broad term that means “vice,” the opposite of “virtue.” If your language has a general term for “vice,” you could use it here. Alternate translation: “vice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:8	f59z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	αἰσχρολογίαν	1	The phrase **obscene speech** refers to “shameful words,” words that are not spoken in polite company. If your language has a word or phrase for these kinds of words, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “and obscenities” or “and cursing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:8	n23c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν	1	Here, **from your mouth** is an idiom that refers to speaking, since speech comes out of the **mouth**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea with a word such as “talk.” Alternate translation: “in your talk” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:9	molr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀπεκδυσάμενοι	1	The clause that begins with **having taken off** could: (1) give the reason why the Colossians should not lie to each other (and should put off the sins listed in the previous verse). Alternate translation: “because you have taken off” (2) give another command. Alternate translation: “and take off” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:9	vsd8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπεκδυσάμενοι τὸν παλαιὸν ἄνθρωπον	1	Here Paul uses a metaphor that is similar to one he used in [2:11](../02/11.md), where he speaks of the “circumcision of Christ” that “puts off” the body of flesh. Here, he speaks of the **old man** as if it were a piece of clothing that the Colossians could “take off.” This does not mean that their true selves are found underneath the **old man**, since the next verse has them putting on the **new man**. Instead, Paul uses the metaphor to illustrate how they have changed identity from **old** to “new.” If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having forsaken your old identity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:9	x13d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸν παλαιὸν ἄνθρωπον	1	Paul uses the phrase **the old man** as part of his language about dying and rising with Christ. The **old man** is thus the person who died with Christ. It does not refer to a part of the person, but rather, it refers to what the whole person used to be before dying with Christ. This is why the ULT uses the neuter pronoun **its** to refer to **old man** later in the verse. If **the old man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a term that refers to the whole person and who he or she used to be. Alternate translation: “the old ‘you’” or “your old identity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:9	qlmf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	While the word **man** is grammatically masculine, it does not refer primarily to male people but to humans in general. If you have a general word for humans in your language, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “human” or “human being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:9	cowf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σὺν ταῖς πράξεσιν αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **practices**, you can express the idea by using a relative clause that refers to what the **old man** “normally does.” Alternate translation: “along with what it does” or “with how it acts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	ya9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐνδυσάμενοι	1	The clause that begins with **having put on** is parallel to the clause beginning with “having taken off” in the previous verse ([3:9](../03/09.md)). Translate this clause with the same structure you used in the previous verse. This clause could (1) give the reason why the Colossians should not lie to each other (and should put off the sins listed in the [3:8](../03/08.md)). Alternate translation: “because you have put on” (2) give another command. Alternate translation: “put on” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:10	brx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνδυσάμενοι τὸν νέον	1	Here, Paul continues the metaphor of changing clothing, which he began in [3:9](../03/09.md). Once the Colossians have “taken off” the “old man,” they **put on** the **new man**. Translate this expression as an appropriate opposite to your translation of “take off” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “having stepped into your new identity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:10	q1ts		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸν νέον	1	As in the previous verse ([3:9](../03/09.md)), the phrase **new man** does not refer to a male person but to what one has become when one is raised with Christ. It does not refer to a part of the person but rather to what the whole person has become after being raised with Christ. If **new man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a term that refers to the whole person and who they are. Alternate translation: “the new ‘you’” or “your new identity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:10	sr6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν ἀνακαινούμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “whom God is renewing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:10	jlhz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν,	1	The first thing Paul says about the “renewing” is its purpose, which is **knowledge**. If **in knowledge** would not be understood as a purpose statement in your language, you could use an expression that indicates that gaining **knowledge** is one purpose of **being renewed**. Alternate translation: “to gain knowledge” or “so as to know more” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
3:10	degc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπίγνωσιν	1	While Paul does not say here what this **knowledge** concerns, it probably refers to knowing both God (as in [1:10](../01/10.md)) and God’s will (as in [1:9](../01/09.md)). If **knowledge** without any description would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what this knowledge concerns. Alternate translation: “the knowledge of God and his will” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:10	mw3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπίγνωσιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you can express the idea in a different way, such as with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “what you know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	v7xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	κατ’ εἰκόνα τοῦ κτίσαντος αὐτόν	1	The second thing Paul says about the “renewing” is the standard or pattern by which God renews his people: the **image of the one who created it**. Use a word or phrase in your language that indicates the standard or pattern according to which something is accomplished. Alternate translation: “so that it matches the image of the one who created it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
3:10	d15v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εἰκόνα	1	The word **image** could refer to (1) the way humans show or reflect God’s glory, just like he created them to do. Alternate translation: “the reflection of the glory” (2) Christ, who is the image of God, the way humans can see the invisible God. Alternate translation: “Christ, the image” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:10	rqsf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατ’ εἰκόνα τοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **image**, you can express the idea in a different way, such as with a relative clause. Make sure your translation fits with what **image** refers to, as discussed in the previous note. Alternate translation: “according to how you reflect the one” or “according to Christ, who reflects the one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:10	jep5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦ κτίσαντος	1	The **one who created it** refers to God. If **the one who created it** would be misunderstood, you could clarify that God is **the one**. Alternate translation: “of God, who created” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:10	xnc0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτόν	1	The pronoun **it** refers to “the new man.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express what **it** refers to by translating **it** with a phrase that more clearly refers back to “the new man.” Alternate translation: “this new man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:11	wnmm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅπου	1	Here Paul refers to the “new man” from the previous verse as if it were a place one could be in. This means that the word **where** refers to the new situation of those who have put on this “new man.” If **where** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by identifying those who have put on the “new man” as the ones addressed by this verse. Alternate translation: (start a new sentence) “For those who have put on the new man,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:11	mrpc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἔνι	1	Here, Paul speaks as if none of the kinds of people he mentions exist in this new situation. The Colossians would have understood this as a way to emphasize how little the differences between all these kinds of people matter once they have died and risen with Christ. They all fit into the category of the “new man” now. If **there is no** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea without the hyperbole by emphasizing the new unity of people from all these categories. Alternate translation: “all people are the same,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:11	t2w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	οὐκ ἔνι Ἕλλην καὶ Ἰουδαῖος, περιτομὴ καὶ ἀκροβυστία, βάρβαρος, Σκύθης, δοῦλος, ἐλεύθερος	1	All these terms are nouns that refer to groups of people that are characterized by the trait that the noun names. These words do not refer to just one person. If your language has a way to categorize people by characteristics, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “there are no Greek and Jewish people, circumcised and uncircumcised people, barbaric people, Scythian people, enslaved people, free people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
3:11	vt4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βάρβαρος	1	The word **barbarian** was used by people who spoke Greek to describe anyone who did not speak Greek. If **barbarian** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a word such as “foreign.” Alternate translation: “alien” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:11	n7by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	Σκύθης	1	The word **Scythian** was used to describe a nomadic group of people who were fierce warriors. It was also used to describe those who behaved in similar ways, who were often considered rough or rude. If **Scythian** would be misunderstood in your language, you could add an adjective before **Scythian** to clarify its connotation, or you could use a comparable label. Alternate translation: “uncivilized Scythian” or “rough Scythian” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:11	i964		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντα καὶ & Χριστός	1	Here Paul speaks of **Christ** as being **all** things. By this, he means that none of the categories he just listed matter because Christ is the only person who matters. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a verb such as “matters” or a noun such as “importance.” Alternate translation: “Christ is all that matters, and he is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:11	iqmw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν πᾶσιν	1	Again, Paul speaks of those who have died and risen with Christ. Here, instead of speaking of the Colossians being “in Christ,” he reverses the form, just as he did in [1:27](../01/27.md): Christ is **in all** of those who believe in him. If possible, translate this expression the same way you translated “Christ in you” in [1:27](../01/27.md). Alternate translation: “is united to all of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	hu90		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	Here the word **Therefore** introduces an exhortation based on what Paul has already told the Colossians in [3:9–11](../03/09.md) about putting off the old man, putting on the new man, and the effects of this. Use a word or phrase in your language that introduces an exhortation based on what has already been said, and you could refer back to what Paul has already said. Alternate translation: “Because you have put off the old man and put on the new man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:12	yyfe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνδύσασθε	1	The phrase **put on** uses the same words Paul used in [3:10](../03/10.md) for “having put on” the new man. Here, he uses the same clothing metaphor to show the Colossians that “putting on” the new man means that they also must **put on** the character traits he lists here. This means that they must consistently behave in ways that show **mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, {and} patience**. If possible, translate **put on** as you did in [3:10](../03/10.md). Alternate translation: “step into new virtues, including” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	vcc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς	1	Paul uses the word **as** to introduce his description of who the Colossians are. He describes them in ways that will give them a reason to “put on” the virtues he lists. If **as** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using a word or phrase that gives a reason or basis for a command. Alternate translation: “because you are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:12	b5ti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐκλεκτοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul here uses the possessive form to indicate that the Colossians are **chosen ones** because **God** chose them. If your language would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by translating **chosen** with a verb such as “chose,” with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “ones whom God has chosen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:12	u914		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ, χρηστότητα, ταπεινοφροσύνην, πραΰτητα, μακροθυμίαν;	1	If your language would not use abstract nouns to express these ideas, you could (1) translate the abstract nouns as verbs. Alternate translation: “the character traits of showing care to others, treating them nicely, not thinking highly of yourselves, considering others more important than yourselves, and not being easily annoyed” (2) translate the abstract nouns as adjectives. Alternate translation: “the merciful, kind, humble, gentle, and patient new man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:12	w259		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ	1	Greek speakers could refer to the **inner parts** as the location of emotions, especially emotions related to love or empathy for another person. The **inner parts of mercy**, then, refers to having **mercy** where one experiences emotions. In this sentence, **inner parts** is connected with an **of** only to **mercy**, not to any of the other character traits. If **inner parts of mercy** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an alternate metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “a heart of mercy” or “a merciful heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:12	d217		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	χρηστότητα	1	The word **kindness** refers to the character trait of being good, kind, or helpful to others. If **kindness** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “a generous attitude toward others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:12	dzuj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πραΰτητα	1	The word **gentleness** describes the character trait of being considerate of and gentle with others. If **gentleness** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “a considerate attitude” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:12	yn05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μακροθυμίαν	1	In this context, the word **patience** refers to the ability to remain calm and even-tempered even when others do things that provoke one to anger. If **patience** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “and forbearance” or “and the ability to remain calm” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:13	m1d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἀνεχόμενοι ἀλλήλων καὶ χαριζόμενοι ἑαυτοῖς, ἐάν τις πρός τινα ἔχῃ μομφήν	1	If your language would put the conditional statement first, you could move the **if** clause to the beginning, starting a new sentence. Alternate translation: “If someone may have a complaint against someone else, bear with one another and be gracious to each other” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
3:13	r8iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνεχόμενοι ἀλλήλων	1	In Paul’s culture, the phrase **bearing with one another** refers to being patient with others, even when they do things that are annoying or strange. If **bearing with one another** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “putting up with one another” or “being patient with one another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:13	rts1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐάν	1	Paul uses **if** to introduce a hypothetical situation that he thinks will happen among the Colossians at times. It is in this kind of situation that he wants them to “bear with one another and be gracious to each other.” If your language would not use **if** to express that idea, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that refers to any time something happens. Alternate translation: “whenever” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
3:13	f5f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τις πρός τινα ἔχῃ μομφήν	1	This phrase indicates a situation in which one person feels offended or hurt by another person. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or an expression that indicates that one party has been offended or hurt by another. Alternate translation: “a person has been offended by another person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:13	p474		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρός & ἔχῃ μομφήν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **complaint**, you can express the idea by translating the abstract noun as a verb. Alternate translation: “may complain against” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:13	lp1o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καθὼς καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐχαρίσατο ὑμῖν, οὕτως καὶ ὑμεῖς	1	If your language would put the comparison after the command, you could switch them in your translation, including “forgive” in the new first clause. Alternate translation: “you should forgive others, just as the Lord forgave you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
3:13	lkdl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	καθὼς καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐχαρίσατο ὑμῖν	1	Here Paul draws a comparison between how he wants the Colossians to forgive and how Jesus has forgiven them. Use a word or phrase that would normally be used for comparing things that are similar. Alternate translation: “in the same way that the Lord forgave you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
3:13	l0kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὕτως καὶ ὑμεῖς	1	Paul leaves out words that could be needed in some languages to make a complete statement. If your language needs these words, you could supply words such as “forgive one another.” Alternate translation: “so also you should forgive each other” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:14	l1ik		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ πᾶσιν δὲ τούτοις, τὴν ἀγάπην	1	Here Paul speaks as if **love** is higher than, or **above**, all the things he has said. By this, he means that **love** is more important than **all these things**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively with a word such as “important” or “essential.” Alternate translation: “But what is most essential is love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	mlfc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τὴν ἀγάπην	1	Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a complete thought. If your language would include more words, you could insert the words that Paul implies, which can be found in [3:12](../03/12.md): “put on.” Alternate translation: “put on love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
3:14	c5o7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **love**, you can express the idea by using a verb. If your language requires you to specify who the Colossians are supposed to “love,” you can clarify that Paul has other believers in mind first, but he is also thinking of God. Alternate translation: “love one another” or “love each other and God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:14	x5g8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅ ἐστιν σύνδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος	1	Here, **the bond of perfection** is a metaphor for something that brings people together in perfect unity. This could refer to (1) the perfect unity in community that Paul wishes for believers. Alternate translation: “which brings you together in perfect unity” (2) the perfect unity that love brings to all Christian virtues. Alternate translation: “which brings all these virtues together to perfection” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:14	bp1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	σύνδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe: (1) **the bond** that leads to **perfection**. Alternate translation: “the bond that brings perfection” (2) **the bond** that has **perfection**. Alternate translation: “the perfect bond” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:14	welw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σύνδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **perfection**, you can express the idea by an adjective such as “perfect” or a verb such as “complete.” Alternate translation: “the perfect bond” or “the bond that completes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:15	gtz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἡ εἰρήνη τοῦ Χριστοῦ βραβευέτω ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	Here Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could translate this imperative in the second person, with the Colossians as the subject of a verb such as “obey” and the **peace of Christ** as the object. Alternate translation: “in your hearts obey the peace of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
3:15	hdg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ εἰρήνη τοῦ Χριστοῦ βραβευέτω ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	Paul speaks of the **peace of Christ** as if it should be the “ruler” in the Colossians’ hearts. The word **rule** is closely related to the word translated “deprive of your prize” that Paul uses in [2:18](../02/18.md): both are used of a judge or an umpire making a decision, although in [2:18](../02/18.md), the judge or umpire decides against the Colossians. Here, the idea is that the **peace of Christ** acts as the judge or umpire in the **hearts** of the Colossians, which means that this **peace** helps them decide what to feel and do. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “let the peace of Christ make your decisions in your hearts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:15	pz4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	In Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. If that meaning of **hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in your minds” or “your thinking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:15	okpr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἣν	1	The pronoun **which** refers to “the peace of Christ.” If what **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “which peace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
3:15	nj4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ ἐκλήθητε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God called you also” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:15	pod6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ἑνὶ σώματι	1	Paul speaks of the Colossians as if they were **in**, or part of, **one body**. With this metaphor, he clarifies the situation in which they have been called to peace: in the **one body**, which is the church. Just as the parts of a body are at “peace” with each other (when the body is working properly), so also the Colossians are to be at peace with each other in the church. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “as you together make up the church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:15	bfnp			εὐχάριστοι γίνεσθε	1	Alternate translation: “become thankful people” or “be thankful”
3:16	agax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐνοικείτω ἐν ὑμῖν πλουσίως	1	Here Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express Paul’s command in the second person with the Colossians as the subject of a verb such as “welcome.” Alternate translation: “Welcome the word of Christ richly into your lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
3:16	w9dv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐνοικείτω ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Here Paul speaks as if the **word of Christ** were a person who could **dwell** or live in a location, which is the group of believers in Colossae. This metaphor emphasizes how the **word of Christ** should be a consistent and constant part of the Colossians’ lives as surely as if it were somebody permanently living with them. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Let the word of Christ be a part of your lives consistently and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:16	g0h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to relate **the word** to **Christ**. This could mean: (1) that **the word** is about **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the word concerning the Messiah” (2) that **the word** is spoken by **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the word from Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:16	mz40		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος	1	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:16	frn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλουσίως	1	Here Paul speaks as if the “word” were wealthy and could do something **richly**. He uses this metaphor to command that the word should dwell in the Colossians completely and with all the blessings that come from it. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in every way and with every blessing” or “fully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:16	aqx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **wisdom**, you can express the idea another way. Alternate translation: “in all wise ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:16	e44g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ, διδάσκοντες καὶ νουθετοῦντες ἑαυτοὺς & ᾄδοντες	1	Paul uses the words **teaching**, **admonishing**, and **singing** to show the Colossians some ways in which they can “let the word of Christ dwell” in them. Therefore, **teaching**, **admonishing**, and **singing** happen at the same time as **the word of Christ** dwelling in them. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could directly state it. Alternate translation: (start a new sentence) “you could do this by teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom … and by singing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
3:16	h5k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	διδάσκοντες καὶ νουθετοῦντες	1	These two verbs have only slightly different meanings. The word **teaching** refers positively to giving someone information, skills, or concepts. The word **admonishing** refers negatively to warning someone against something. If you have words that fit these two ideas, you could use them here. If you do not have words that make these distinctions, you could translate both of them with a single verb such as “instruct.” Alternate translation: “instructing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:16	ubi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ψαλμοῖς, ὕμνοις, ᾠδαῖς πνευματικαῖς	1	These three terms name different kinds of songs. The word **psalms** refers to songs from the book of Psalms in the Bible. The word **hymns** refers to songs sung in praise, usually to a deity. Finally, the word **songs** refers to vocal music that celebrates someone or something, usually in poem form. If you have words that roughly match these categories in your language, you could use them here. If you do not have words that match these categories, you could express the idea with only one or two words or use adjectives to describe the different types of songs. Alternate translation: “psalms and spiritual songs” or “biblical songs, praise songs, and celebratory spiritual songs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:16	eapz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ᾠδαῖς πνευματικαῖς	1	The word **spiritual** could refer to (1) the Holy Spirit as the origin or inspiration of the **songs**. Alternate translation: “and songs from the Spirit” (2) **songs** that are sung by or in the power of the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “and songs empowered by the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:16	ese7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ χάριτι,	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **thankfulness**, you can express the idea by using an adverb such as “thankfully” or an adjective such as “thankful.” Alternate translation: “in thankful ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:16	jv2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	Here the Colossians would have understood the phrase **in your hearts** to describe something that people do that they fully believe in. It means that the **singing** should be done with sincerity and the full approval of one’s own mind. If this idiom would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable idiom or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “wholeheartedly” or “with genuineness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:16	ives		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	In Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and desire. If that meaning of **hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in your minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:17	ivxg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	πᾶν, ὅ τι ἐὰν ποιῆτε ἐν λόγῳ ἢ ἐν ἔργῳ, πάντα ἐν	1	The word **all** refers back to **everything, whatever you might do in word or in deed**. If your language would not write the object (**everything, whatever you might do in word or in deed**) first, you could put it where **all** is, after the verb. Or, you could change the object into a relative clause. Alternate translation: “do everything, whatever you might do in word or in deed, in” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
3:17	g059		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πᾶν, ὅ τι ἐὰν ποιῆτε	1	In Paul’s culture, this is a natural way to refer to anything someone might do, including all possibilities. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way to refer to all possible actions. Alternate translation: “anything you do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:17	g8p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν λόγῳ ἢ ἐν ἔργῳ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **word** and **deed**, you can express the idea with verbs such as “speak” and “act.” Alternate translation: “in speaking or in acting” or “when you speak or act” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:17	uix9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	Acting **in the name of** a person means representing that person. Representatives, those who do anything **in the name of** someone else, should act so as to help others think well of and honor the people they represent. If **in the name of** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom for representing someone or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “as representatives of the Lord Jesus” or “in a way that leads to honor for the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:17	bv84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δι’ αὐτοῦ	1	The phrase **through him** does not mean that the prayers of thanks are mediated to God the Father by God the Son. Rather, it is **through** the Son that the Colossians are able to give thanks. This means that they can give thanks because of what the Son has done for them. If that meaning of **through him** would not be understood in your language, you could express the idea with a preposition such as “because” or clarify that it is **through** the “work” of the Son. Alternate translation: “because of what he has done” or “through his work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:18	tt9u			αἱ γυναῖκες	1	Here Paul directly addresses the **wives** in the audience. Use a form in your language that indicates that the speaker is singling out a specific group of people as the intended audience of the following words. Alternate translation: “You wives”
3:18	gtft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑποτάσσεσθε τοῖς ἀνδράσιν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form with a verb such as “obey” or “submit.” Alternate translation: “obey your husbands” or “submit to your husbands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:18	dc5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς ἀνδράσιν	1	Here Paul does not explicitly state that wives must **be subjected** to “their own” husbands. However, Paul writes this sentence in such a way that the Colossians would have understood him to mean this. The ULT includes **{your}** because this is an essential part of what Paul is saying. Use a form in your language that specifies that Paul has each wife’s husband in mind. Alternate translation: “to your own husbands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:18	juqx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς	1	Here, the word **as** functions to introduce the reason why “wives” should “be subjected to” their **husbands**. If **as** does not indicate a reason in your language, you could express this idea using a causal word such as “since” or “because.” Alternate translation: “because this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:18	b2y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνῆκεν	1	The phrase **is fitting** refers to what or to whom something properly belongs. If **is fitting** would be misunderstood your language, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that identifies proper behavior in specific circumstances. Alternate translation: “is suitable” or “suits your position” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:18	y1m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord** or united to the Lord is the standard for how to behave. Alternate translation: “in your union with the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:19	apyy			οἱ ἄνδρες	1	Here Paul directly addresses the **husbands** in the audience. Use a form in your language that indicates that the speaker is singling out a specific group of people as the intended audience of the following words. Alternate translation: “You husbands”
3:19	n9dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰς γυναῖκας	1	Here Paul does not explicitly state that husbands must **love** “their own” wives. However, Paul writes this sentence in such a way that the Colossians would have understood him to mean this. The ULT includes **{your}** because this is an essential part of what Paul is saying. Use a form in your language that specifies that Paul has each husband’s wife in mind. Alternate translation: “your own wives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:19	lc4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ πικραίνεσθε πρὸς	1	The phrase **be embittered** could refer to (1) the husband doing or saying things that cause his wife to be bitter or upset with him. Alternate translation: “do not do what makes them bitter against you” (2) the husband becoming bitter or upside with his wife for doing or saying certain things. Alternate translation: “do not become bitter against them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:20	mlu2			τὰ τέκνα	1	Here Paul directly addresses the **Children** in the audience. Use a form in your language that indicates that the speaker is singling out a specific group of people as the intended audience of the following words. Alternate translation: “You children”
3:20	imh3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς γονεῦσιν	1	Here Paul does not explicitly state that children must **obey** “their own” parents. However, Paul writes this sentence in such a way that the Colossians would have understood him to mean this. The ULT includes **{your}** because this is an essential part of what Paul is saying. Use a form in your language that specifies that Paul has each child’s parents in mind. Alternate translation: “your own parents” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:20	gu2o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ πάντα	1	The phrase **in all things** is an idiom that indicates that children should obey “everything their parents command” or “in every situation.” If **in all things** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or indicate what the **things** are. Alternate translation: “in everything they tell you to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:20	kadq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	The word **for** introduces the basis or reason for somethin; here it is Paul’s command to children. Use a word that indicates the reason for a command in your language. Alternate translation: “since” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:20	vbad		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	εὐάρεστόν ἐστιν	1	If something **is pleasing**, that means that the person it “pleases” finds that thing acceptable, agreeable, or pleasant. If **is pleasing** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that emphasizes that obedience to parents is something that is acceptable to God. Alternate translation: “is acceptable” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:20	vps1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐάρεστόν	1	Paul does not state to whom obedience to parents is **pleasing**, but it is clear that it pleases God. If your language would state who is pleased, you could expressly state that it is God. Alternate translation: “pleasing to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:20	ales		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Just as in [3:18](../03/18.md), Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to **the Lord**, identifies specifically that those who are united to **the Lord** are to behave in this way. Alternate translation: “in your union with the Lord” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
3:21	uc7r			οἱ πατέρες	1	Here Paul directly addresses the **Fathers** in the audience. Use a form in your language that indicates that the speaker is singling out a specific group of people as the intended audience of the following words. Alternate translation: “You fathers”
3:21	bvi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ ἐρεθίζετε τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν	1	The word **provoke** in this context refers to irritating someone or making them angry. If **provoke** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “do not irritate your children” or “do not provoke your children to anger” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:21	ozeh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα μὴ ἀθυμῶσιν	1	This clause indicates the goal or purpose of the previous command, but this purpose is in the negative. If your language has a customary way to indicate a negative purpose, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “lest they be discouraged” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
3:21	fvi7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ ἀθυμῶσιν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form with the **Fathers** as the subject. Alternate translation: “you may not discourage them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:21	bjk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀθυμῶσιν	1	The phrase **they may … be discouraged** describes the feeling of despair or hopelessness. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “they may … despair” or “they may … lose heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:22	lf6k			οἱ δοῦλοι	1	Here Paul directly addresses the **Slaves** in the audience. Use a form in your language that indicates that the speaker is singling out a specific group of people as the intended audience of the following words. Alternate translation: “You slaves”
3:22	cx6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τοῖς κατὰ σάρκα κυρίοις	1	The phrase **according to the flesh** describes the **masters** as humans on this earth. Paul uses this phrase to describe these **masters** because he is already setting up a contrast with the “Master” over these masters: Jesus (see [4:1](../04/01.md)). If **according to the flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea with an adjective such as “human” or “earthly.” Alternate translation: “your earthly masters” or “your human masters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:22	o6mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς & κυρίοις	1	Here Paul does not explicitly state that slaves must **obey** “their own” masters. However, Paul writes this sentence in such a way that the Colossians would have understood him to mean this. The ULT includes **{your}** because this is an essential part of what Paul is saying. Use a form in your language that specifies that Paul has each slave’s master in mind. Alternate translation: “your own masters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:22	iy1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ πάντα	1	Just as in [3:20](../03/20.md), the phrase **in all things** is an idiom that indicates that slaves should obey “everything their masters command” or “in every situation.” If **in all things** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or indicate what the **things** are. Alternate translation: “in everything they tell you to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:22	p36t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοδουλεία	1	The word **eyeservice** describes how people sometimes behave to look good more than to do the right thing. If **eyeservice** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or a short phrase such as “wanting to look impressive.” Alternate translation: “not focusing on how you appear to others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:22	b5en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὡς ἀνθρωπάρεσκοι	1	The phrase **people pleasers** describes the kind of people who care about “eyeservice.” Here, **people pleasers** are those who focus on impressing humans rather than doing what God desires. If these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could emphasize that **people pleasers** want to please humans only, not God. Alternate translation: “as people who want to please humans rather than God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:22	r22m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐν ἁπλότητι καρδίας	1	Paul here uses the possessive form to describe a **heart** that is characterized by its **sincerity**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by translating **sincerity** with an adjective such as “sincere.” Alternate translation: “with a sincere heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:22	ouca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἁπλότητι καρδίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sincerity**, you can express the idea by using an adjective such as “sincere” or and adverb such as “sincerely.” Alternate translation: “sincerely in your heart” or “with a sincere heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:22	m27w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καρδίας	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where a person thinks and desires. If that meaning of **heart** would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “of mind” or “of desire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:22	tsn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον	1	The phrase **fearing the Lord** could describe: (1) the reason why the slaves should obey their masters. Alternate translation: “because you fear the Lord” (2) the way or manner in which the slaves should obey their masters. Alternate translation: “showing fear for the Lord” or “in a way that shows that you fear the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:23	olwu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὃ ἐὰν ποιῆτε	1	In Paul’s culture, this is a natural way to refer to anything someone might do, including all possibilities. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way of referring to all possible actions. Alternate translation: “In anything you do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:23	itn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ ψυχῆς	1	Working **from the soul** is comparable to the English idiom working “with all one’s heart,” which refers to doing something with diligence, without holding anything back. If **from the soul** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable idiom or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “with all your heart” or “with all your strength” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:23	arw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὡς τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώποις	1	This contrast indicates that, even though they serve **men**, they should consider their work to be directed to or in service of **the Lord**. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a contrast phrase such as “even as.” Alternate translation: “to serve the Lord, even as you are serving men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:23	ckiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	The word **men** does not refer to only male people but to humans in general. If **men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that refers to people or humans in general. Alternate translation: “to humans” or “to people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
3:24	p5qy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδότες	1	The word **knowing** introduces a reason why the slaves should obey as Paul commands them to in [3:22–23](../03/22.md). If **knowing** would not introduce a reason in your language, you could clarify this by using a word such as “because.” Alternate translation: “since you know” or “for you know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:24	f3ed		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν ἀνταπόδοσιν τῆς κληρονομίας	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify the **reward** as **the inheritance**. If your language does not use the possessive form in this way, you can clarify that these two words name the same thing by using a phrase such as “that is.” Alternate translation: “the reward, that is, the inheritance” or “the reward, which is your inheritance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
3:24	sod6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀνταπόδοσιν τῆς κληρονομίας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **reward** and **inheritance**, you can express those ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “what he has promised to hand down to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:24	oyo4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	τῷ Κυρίῳ Χριστῷ δουλεύετε	1	Here Paul uses a simple statement as (1) a reminder that states for whom they actually work. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that you are serving the Lord Christ” (2) a command about whom they should serve. Alternate translation: “Serve the Lord Christ” or “You should serve the Lord Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
3:25	fvw0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	The word **for** introduces support for what has already been said. Here Paul uses it to introduce a negative reason for obedience (he already gave a positive reason in [3:24](../03/24.md)). If **for** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it introduces another reason for obedience. Alternate translation: “Do these things because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:25	u5lx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ & ἀδικῶν & ἠδίκησεν	1	Here Paul speaks in general of anyone who does **unrighteousness**. However, he directs this general statement to the slaves he has been addressing (not the masters, since he does not address them until [4:1](../04/01.md)). If this generic form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary form for generic statements or include the slaves as the ones being addressed. Alternate translation: “any of you who do unrighteousness … you did unrighteously” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
3:25	sttw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀδικῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **unrighteousness**, you can express the idea differently, such as with an adverb. Alternate translation: “acting unrighteously” or “doing unrighteous things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:25	ak8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κομιεῖται ὃ ἠδίκησεν	1	In this context, the phrase **will receive** refers to getting something in payment or in return for something else. Paul, then, speaks as if **the one doing unrighteousness** will **receive** as payment or recompense exactly **what he did unrighteously**. By this, Paul means that God will punish those who do **unrighteousness** in a way that fits with what they did. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “will receive a punishment that fits the crime” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:25	c9fx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔστιν προσωπολημψία	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **favoritism**, you can express the idea with a verb such as “favor” or with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “God does not favor anyone” or “God judges everyone by the same standard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:intro	nm3y				0	# Colossians 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n[4:1](../col/04/01.md) belongs to the section that begins in [3:18](../03/18.md), even though it is in this chapter.\n\n3. Exhortation Section\n* Prayer Request and Behavior towards Outsiders (4:2–6)\n\n4. Letter Closing (4:7–18)\n* The Messengers (4:7–9)\n* Greetings from Friends (4:10–14)\n* Greetings and Instructions from Paul (4:15–17)\n* Greeting in Paul’s Own Hand (4:18)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Letter writing and sending\n\nIn this culture, someone who wanted to send a letter often spoke what they wanted to say, and a scribe would write it down for them. Then, they would send the letter with a messenger, who would read the letter to the person or people to whom it was addressed. In this chapter, Paul mentions the messengers with whom he is sending his letter: Tychicus and Onesimus ([4:7–9](../04/07.md)). They also are able to communicate more about Paul’s situation than he says in the letter. Additionally, Paul mentions that he writes the final greeting “by my own hand” ([4:18](../04/18.md)). This is because the rest of the letter was written by a scribe, who wrote down what Paul dictated. Paul writes the last greeting as a personal touch and to prove that he was indeed the author.\n\n### Greetings\n\nIn this culture, it was common for those who sent letters to include greetings to and from others in their letter. In this way, many people could greet each other but only send one letter. In [4:10–15](../04/10.md) Paul includes greetings to and from many people whom he and the Colossians know.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Paul’s chains\n\nPaul refers to his imprisonment in this chapter by using the language of “chains” and “binding.” He says that he has “been bound” in [4:3](../04/03.md), and he mentions his “chains” in [4:18](../04/18.md). The language of binding and chains emphasizes how Paul is restricted in his movements and activities by being imprisoned.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### A “master in heaven”\n\nIn [4:1](../04/01.md), Paul refers to a “master in heaven.” The word translated “master” and “masters” in this verse is the same word that is translated as “Lord” throughout Colossians. It is translated “master” in this verse to illustrate Paul’s point: those who are “masters” on earth also have a “master,” their Lord in heaven. If possible, make this wordplay clear in your translation.
4:1	b9nm			οἱ κύριοι	1	Here Paul directly addresses the **Masters** in the audience. Use a form in your language that indicates that the speaker is singling out a specific group of people as the intended audience of the following words. Alternate translation: “You masters”
4:1	orih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα τοῖς δούλοις παρέχεσθε	1	Here Paul speaks of how masters treat their slaves as if the master were “giving” the treatment of their slaves. By this, he means that the thing given (**what is right and fair**) is what characterizes the master’s dealing with the slave. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using adverbs such as “rightly” and “fairly” with a verb such as “treat.” Alternate translation: “act rightly and fairly towards your slaves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:1	ae3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα	1	The word **right** describes someone or something that properly follows laws, principles, and expectations. The word translated **fair** describes someone or something that is impartial and does not pick sides. If you have words in your language that roughly represent these ideas, you could them here. If you do not have words that make these distinctions, you could express the idea with one word that indicates that something is fair, legal, and proper. Alternate translation: “what is just and impartial” or “what is right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:1	pgqt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδότες	1	Paul uses the word **knowing** to introduce a reason why the masters should treat their slaves as he commands them to. If **knowing** would not introduce a reason in your language, you could make this explicit with a word such as “because” or “since.” Alternate translation: “since you know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:1	t9wy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Κύριον ἐν οὐρανῷ	1	The words **Masters** and **master** are usually translated “lords” and “Lord” elsewhere. However, here they are translated **Masters** and **master** because the relationship between slaves and their masters, or “lords,” is in view. Paul wishes the **Masters** to treat their slaves justly because they also serve a “Master,” the Lord Jesus. If the person to whom **master** refers would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by identifying that the **master** is the Lord Jesus. Alternate translation: “a master in heaven, the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:2	pp1c			τῇ προσευχῇ προσκαρτερεῖτε	1	Alternate translation: “Keep praying faithfully” or “Pray consistently”
4:2	gmtv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	γρηγοροῦντες	1	The word **staying alert** expresses what Paul wants the Colossians to do as they pray. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary expression that indicates that **staying alert** happens at the same time as they “continue steadfastly in prayer.” Alternate translation: “and stay alert” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
4:2	wv73			ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Alternate translation: “during your time of prayer”
4:2	calz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **thanksgiving**, you can express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “and giving thanks” or an adverb such as “thankfully.” Alternate translation: “thankfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:3	iqjo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἅμα	1	In this context, the word **together** does not refer to people being together but rather, it refers to actions happening **together** or at the same time. If **together** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that the Colossians should pray for Paul at the same time they pray about other things (the things mentioned in [4:2](../04/02.md)). Alternate translation: “at the same time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
4:3	sct4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμῖν	1	In this verse, the word **us** refers to Paul and Timothy but not to the Colossians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:3	ql6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) the content of what they should pray. Alternate translation: “that” or “asking that” (2) the purpose for which the Colossians should pray for Paul. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:3	ub1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Θεὸς ἀνοίξῃ ἡμῖν θύραν τοῦ λόγου	1	Here Paul speaks of God providing opportunities for Paul and Timothy to preach the gospel as if God were “opening” a **door** to them **for the word**. The image is of God opening a door so that Paul and Timothy can go in and preach the message about Christ. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God may give us opportunities to preach the word” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:3	m7z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοῦ λόγου, λαλῆσαι	1	Here, **for the word** and **to speak** mean almost the same thing. If your language would not use both of phrases here, you could combine them into one. Alternate translation: “to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:3	w4fl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ λόγου	1	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “for the message” or “for what we say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:3	tl71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	λαλῆσαι	1	The phrase **to speak** indicates the purpose for which the “door” is opened. If **to speak** would not indicate purpose in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does indicate purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that we might speak” or “so that we can speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:3	ce37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ μυστήριον	1	Paul speaks of his message as **the mystery** of Christ. This does not mean that the message is hard to understand, but rather that it had not previously been revealed. Now, however, Paul does “make it clear” (as [4:4](../04/04.md) says). If a **mystery** that is revealed or spoken would be misunderstood in your language, you could replace **mystery** with a short descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “the concealed message” or “the previously hidden message” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)
4:3	fkva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak of a **mystery** whose content is a message about **Christ**. If your language does not use the possessive form to express that idea, you can express the idea with a preposition such as “about” or a relative clause such as “that concerns.” Alternate translation: “the mystery that concerns Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:3	gs8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	δι’ ὃ	1	The pronoun **which** refers back to the “mystery of Christ.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly what **which** refers to more clearly by adding a word such as “mystery.” Alternate translation: “on account of which mystery” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:3	q4jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	δέδεμαι	1	Here Paul uses the phase **I have been bound** to refer to how he is in prison. If **I have been bound** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that stands for being in prison or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I am imprisoned” or “I am incarcerated” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:3	lsdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δέδεμαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form with a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “they have bound me” or “the authorities have bound me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:4	x8bf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **in order that** could introduce: (1) another thing for which the Colossians should pray (in addition to what is said in [4:3](../04/03.md)). Alternate translation: “and that” or “and asking that” (2) another purpose for which the Colossians should pray for Paul (in addition to what is said in [4:3](../04/03.md)). Alternate translation: “and so that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:4	hm5w			φανερώσω αὐτὸ	1	Alternate translation: “I may reveal it” or “I may express it clearly”
4:4	rkal		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς	1	Here, the word **as** functions to introduce a reason why Paul must preach his message clearly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of **as** with a word or phrase that introduces a reason for an action. Alternate translation: “because this is how” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:4	ofin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δεῖ με λαλῆσαι	1	If your language would state who requires Paul to speak in these ways, you could include “God” as the one that role. Alternate translation: “God has commanded me to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	z3ax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	περιπατεῖτε πρὸς	1	Here Paul uses the word **walk** to refer to consistent, habitual behavior (like putting one foot in front of the other). In this image, walking **toward** someone refers to consistent behavior in relationship with that person. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Act … with” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:5	u3j7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν σοφίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **wisdom**, you can express the idea with an adverb such as “wisely” or an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “in wise ways” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:5	ww8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τοὺς ἔξω	1	The phrase **those outside** is a way to identify people who do not belong to one’s group. Here, **those outside** would be anyone who does not believe in Jesus. If **those outside** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase for people who are not in one’s group. Alternate translation: “outsiders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:5	nvqu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐξαγοραζόμενοι	1	The word **redeeming** introduces an example of how to “walk in wisdom toward those outside.” If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way to indicate that the **redeeming** happens at the same time as “walking in wisdom” and gives an example of how it might look. Alternate translation: “which includes redeeming” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
4:5	b525		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν καιρὸν ἐξαγοραζόμενοι	1	Here Paul speaks of **time** as something that one could be **redeeming**. The picture is of a person buying **time** from someone. Paul uses this picture to refer to making the most of (**redeeming**) one’s opportunities (**the time**). If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “making the most of every chance you have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:6	bza7			your words always with grace, seasoned with salt	0	This verse provides one way in which Paul wants the Colossians to “walk in wisdom toward those outside” ([4:5](../04/05.md)). They are to speak with words that are compelling and carefully chosen to fit the situation.
4:6	v14n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὁ λόγος ὑμῶν πάντοτε ἐν χάριτι	1	Paul has not included a verb for “speaking” in this phrase, because it was not necessary in his language. If your language would require a verb of speaking here, you could include it. Alternate translation: “speaking your words always with grace” or “your words always spoken with grace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:6	u9mh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν χάριτι	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **grace**, you can express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “gracious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:6	fuv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἅλατι ἠρτυμένος	1	In Paul’s culture, when food was **seasoned with salt**, it would taste good and be nourishing. Paul thus speaks of seasoning one’s “words” **with salt** to say that the words should be interesting (like food that tastes good) and helpful (like food that is nourishing). If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable idiom or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “both compelling and helpful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:6	c1w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδέναι	1	Here Paul uses the phrase **to know** to introduce the result of speaking words **with grace** and **seasoned with salt**. If **to know** does not introduce a result in your language, you could use a word or phrase that more clearly expresses that Paul is speaking about a result. Alternate translation: “with the result that you will know” or “ so that you might know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:6	jdtx			πῶς δεῖ ὑμᾶς & ἀποκρίνεσθαι	1	Alternate translation: “how to best answer” or “the right answer to give to”
4:6	djl0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἑνὶ ἑκάστῳ	1	The phrase **each one** refers to individuals who would be considered part of “those outside” ([4:5](../04/05.md)). If what **each one** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could explicitly refer back to how you translated “those outside.” Alternate translation: “each outsider” or “each one who does not believe in the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:7	ut91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ πάντα γνωρίσει ὑμῖν Τυχικὸς, ὁ ἀγαπητὸς ἀδελφὸς, καὶ πιστὸς διάκονος, καὶ σύνδουλος ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nIf it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange this sentence so that (1) what **Tychicus will make known** to them comes after **to you**, and (2) the words that describe **Tychicus** come after his name. You may need to make one or both of these changes to make the verse clear in your language. Alternate translation: “Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you all the things concerning me” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
4:7	xzz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ πάντα	1	When Paul speaks of **All the things concerning me**, he refers to details about his life such as where he is living, his health, how his work is progressing, and other similar details. If your language has a customary way to refer to this kind of information, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “All the news about me” or “All the details about how I am doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:7	cbzm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Τυχικὸς	1	**Tychicus** is the name of a man. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names)
4:7	m52y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πιστὸς διάκονος	1	If your language would state whom Tychicus serves, you could make this explicit. He could be a **servant** to: (1) Paul. Alternate translation: “my faithful servant” (2) the Lord, and thus the Lord’s church as well. Alternate translation: “faithful servant of the Lord and his church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:7	p7c1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σύνδουλος	1	If **fellow slave** would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit that Tychicus is a **slave** of Christ, along with Paul. Alternate translation: “fellow slave of Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:7	h3mk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, identifies Paul and Tychicus as “slaves” of the Lord because of their union with him. Alternate translation: “in union with the Lord” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
4:8	wmmd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἔπεμψα	1	Here Paul uses the past tense form **sent** to describe something he has not yet done when he is dictating this letter. He uses the past tense because, when the letter is read to the Colossians, his sending of Tychicus will be in the past. If your language would not use the past tense here, you could use whatever tense would customarily be used in this situation in your language. Alternate translation: “whom I send” or “whom I have sent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
4:8	eei1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὑμᾶς εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο, ἵνα	1	It may seem that the phrase **for this very reason** contains redundant information in your language, since Paul also includes **so that**. If both of these phrases would be redundant in your language, you could use a single purpose phrase, such as **so that**. Alternate translation: “you so that” or “you in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:8	iv0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἵνα γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν	1	While many manuscripts have **so that you might know the things concerning us**, some say “so that he might know the things concerning you.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the phrase it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
4:8	fr1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα & καὶ	1	The words **so that** and **and that** introduce two of Paul’s purposes in sending Tychicus to the Colossians. If **so that** and **and that** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way to introduce a goal or purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that … and in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:8	cty1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν	1	Just like the phrase “all the things concerning me” in [4:7](../04/07.md), the phrase **the things concerning us** refers to details about life such as where people are living, their health, how their work is progressing, and other similar details. If your language has a customary way to refer to this kind of information, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “the news about us” or “the details about how we are doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:8	vyq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	The word **us** does not include the Colossians. Instead, Paul is referring to himself and those who are with him, including Timothy. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:8	rw4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν	1	Here when Paul refers to **your hearts**, the Colossians would have understood him to mean the entire person. Paul uses **hearts** because his culture identified **hearts** as the body part where people experienced encouragement. If that meaning of **your hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the location where people experience encouragement in your culture, or you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “your souls” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche)
4:9	f18w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σὺν Ὀνησίμῳ	1	Paul uses this phrase to tell the Colossians that he is sending Onesimus along with Tychicus to the city of Colossae. If this implication would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this explicit by adding a verb such as “sending.” Alternate translation: “With him I send Onesimus” (start a new sentence with “they will make”) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:9	yqh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ὀνησίμῳ	1	**Onesimus** is the name of a man. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names)
4:9	aqe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	The phrase **from among you** means that Onesimus used to live with the Colossians and was part of the group to whom Paul is writing the letter. To express this idea, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that a person belongs to a specific group of people. Alternate translation: “is from your town” or “used to live with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:9	n15d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	γνωρίσουσιν	1	The pronoun **they** refers back to Onesimus and Tychicus. If what **they** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this explicit by using their names or referring to “two” of them. Alternate translation: “the two of them will make known” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:9	vb7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πάντα & τὰ ὧδε	1	Just like the phrases “all the things concerning me” in [4:7](../04/07.md) and “the things concerning us” in [4:8](../04/08.md), the phrase **all the things here** refers to details about life such as where people are living, their health, how their work is progressing, and other similar details. If your language has a customary way to refer to this kind of information, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “all the news about us” or “all the details about what is happening here” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:10	wmf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀρίσταρχος & Μᾶρκος & Βαρναβᾶ	1	These are all names of men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:10	lcxt			ἀσπάζεται	1	As was customary in this culture, Paul concludes the letter by extending greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “asks to be remembered to” or “says hello to”
4:10	v0le		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ συναιχμάλωτός μου	1	The phrase **my fellow prisoner** identifies Aristarchus as someone who is in prison along with Paul. If **fellow prisoner** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this with a short phrase instead. Alternate translation: “who has been imprisoned with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:10	uq72		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ Μᾶρκος, ὁ ἀνεψιὸς Βαρναβᾶ	1	Paul has not included the verb “greet” in this clause because it was unnecessary in his language. If it is necessary in your language, you could include it here. Alternate translation: “and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, also greets you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:10	ta5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	ὁ ἀνεψιὸς Βαρναβᾶ	1	The word **cousin** refers to the son of the brother or sister of one’s mother or father. If possible, use a word in your language that makes this relationship clear, or you could describe the relationship. Alternate translation: “the son of Barnabas’ aunt or uncle” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
4:10	st6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗ & ἔλθῃ & αὐτόν	1	The words **whom**, **he**, and **him** refer back to Mark, not Barnabas. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “Mark … he may come … him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:10	i5ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	περὶ οὗ ἐλάβετε ἐντολάς	1	Paul does not clarify who sent these **orders** to the Colossians, and it was probably not him. If it is possible in your language, leave the person who sent these **orders** unexpressed. If you must clarify who sent the **orders**, you could use an indefinite expression. Alternate translation: “about whom someone sent you orders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:10	wiwq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐὰν ἔλθῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Here Paul indicates a hypothetical situation. It may be that Mark does visit the Colossians, but Paul is not sure if he will or not. Use a form that indicates a true possibility in your language. Alternate translation: “he may or may not come to you, but if he does,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
4:10	a1v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δέξασθε αὐτόν	1	To **receive** someone means welcoming that person into one’s group and extending hospitality to him or her. If **receive** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression that indicates this kind of hospitality or express the idea with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “show him hospitality and accept him into your group” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:11	bm6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰησοῦς & Ἰοῦστος	1	**Jesus** and **Justus** are two names for the same man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:11	p6tp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰοῦστος	1	Here Paul gives further information about “Jesus.” This information identifies which “Jesus” this is (the one also known as **Justus**), distinguishing him from other men who might be named “Jesus.” If this way of introducing a second name would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form in your language that expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “, the one called Justus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
4:11	ktfz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ λεγόμενος	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea in active form, with an indefinite or vague subject. Alternate translation: “whom some people call” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:11	oscc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ Ἰησοῦς, ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰοῦστος	1	Paul has not included the verb “greet” in this clause because it was unnecessary in his language. If it is necessary in your language, you could include it here. Alternate translation: “and Jesus who is called Justus also greets you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:11	o5rh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτοι	1	The word **These** refers back to the three men mentioned in this verse and the previous verse: Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus. If what **These** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could restate their names or indicate the reference in another way. Alternate translation: “These three are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:11	ehgz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	οἱ ὄντες ἐκ περιτομῆς οὗτοι, μόνοι συνεργοὶ εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ, οἵτινες ἐγενήθησάν μοι παρηγορία.	1	Paul here describes the three men in two ways. First, he identifies them as the **only** ones among his **fellow workers** who are Jewish (**from the circumcision**). In other words, Paul distinguishes them from all the other people who work with him, because these three men are the only ones who are circumcised Jews. Second, he describes them as ones **who have been a comfort** to him. Here, he is not distinguishing them from other fellow workers; instead, he just wishes to say that they have **been a comfort** to him. If these descriptions would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate the two descriptions differently so that it is clear that the first distinguishes the three men while the second describes the three men. Alternate translation: “Out of all my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, these are the only ones being from the circumcision, and they have been a comfort to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
4:11	ci74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὄντες ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	Paul uses the label **from the circumcision** to identify the men as Jews who had received circumcision. If **from the circumcision** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea non-figuratively by using a term such as “Jewish.” Alternate translation: “who are Jewish” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:11	b7l6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἵτινες ἐγενήθησάν μοι παρηγορία	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **comfort**, you can express the idea with a verb such as “comfort.” Alternate translation: “who have comforted me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:12	gg86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἐπαφρᾶς	1	**Epaphras** is the name of a man. He was the one who first preached the good news to the people in Colossae (see [Colossians 1:7](../01/07.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:12	et2g			ἀσπάζεται	1	As was customary in this culture, Paul concludes the letter by extending greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “asks to be remembered to” or “says hello to”
4:12	rq61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	The phrase **from among you** means that Epaphras used to live with the Colossians and was part of the group to whom Paul is writing the letter. To express this idea, you could use a word or phrase that indicates in your language that a person belongs to a specific group of people. Alternate translation: “He is from your town” or “He used to live with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:12	ek51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε	1	Here, **always** is an exaggeration that the Colossians would have understood to mean that Epaphras prays for them very often. If **always** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “frequently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
4:12	p8ff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀγωνιζόμενος ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	The word **striving** is usually used for attempting to win a contest, whether that is athletic, military, or legal. While Epaphras is not actually participating in an athletic or military contest, Paul uses the metaphor to explain how earnestly Epaphras prays for the Colossians. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “praying zealously for you” or “spending much effort on his prayers for you” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
4:12	sn23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) the content of Epaphras’ prayers. Alternate translation: “asking that” (2) the purpose or goal of Epaphras’ prayers. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:12	nuh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σταθῆτε τέλειοι καὶ πεπληροφορημένοι ἐν παντὶ θελήματι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks as if the Colossians can **stand complete and fully assured in all the will of God**. By this, he means that they should consistently do God’s will, just as if God’s will served as a foundation underneath them. The words **complete and fully assured** explain the way in which they are supposed to **stand** or continue to obey. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you may be complete and fully assured as you consistently do all the will of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:12	t6o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τέλειοι	1	The word **complete** in this context means that a person is what he or she is supposed to be and is able to do what he or she is called to do. If **complete** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that has this meaning, such as “perfect” or “excellent,” or translate **complete** with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “fit for what God has called you to be” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)
4:12	ojtu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	πεπληροφορημένοι	1	The phrase **fully assured** describes people who are confident or sure of what they believe and do. If **fully assured** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “convinced about what you know” or “without doubts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:12	s7e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν παντὶ θελήματι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **will**, you can express the idea by using a verb such as “wants” or “desires.” Alternate translation: “in whatever God desires” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:13	sg4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	The word **For** introduces further support for Paul’s statements about Epaphras in the previous verse. In [4:12](../04/12.md), Paul says that Epaphras is “always striving” for them, and he supports that claim here by giving his own testimony about how hard Epaphras has worked for the Colossians and for other believers who live near them. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support for a previous statement, or you could refer back to what Paul is supporting. Alternate translation: “you could be sure that he does this, because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:13	k8vv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔχει πολὺν πόνον	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **labor**, you can express the idea by using a verb such as “labor.” Alternate translation: “he labors diligently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:13	zzc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τῶν ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ, καὶ τῶν ἐν Ἱεραπόλει	1	Here Paul leaves out to whom the pronoun **those** refers, since in his language it was clear that **those** refers to people who live in the cities he mentions. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **those** refers to believers who live in these two towns. Alternate translation: “of believers who live in Laodicea, and of believers who live in Hierapolis” or “of believers who live in Laodicea and Hierapolis” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:13	d0et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Λαοδικίᾳ & Ἱεραπόλει	1	**Laodicea** and **Hierapolis** were towns near Colossae. In fact, they were all in the same valley. If it would be helpful to your readers to clarify that these are nearby towns, you could include this information. Alternate translation: “nearby Laodicea … nearby Hierapolis” or “Laodicea … Hierapolis, churches near you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:14	v0ho			ἀσπάζεται	1	As was customary in this culture, Paul concludes the letter by extending greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “asks to be remembered to” or “says hello to”
4:14	hq1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Λουκᾶς & Δημᾶς	1	**Luke** and **Demas** are the names of men. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:14	bv7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀσπάζεται ὑμᾶς Λουκᾶς, ὁ ἰατρὸς ὁ ἀγαπητὸς, καὶ Δημᾶς.	1	Paul has not included the verb “greet” with **and also Demas,** because it was unnecessary in his language. If including “greet” is necessary in your language, you could (1) move **and also Demas** before **greets you**. Alternate translation: “Luke the beloved physician and also Demas greet you” (2) include it with the phrase **and also Demas**. Alternate translation: “Luke the beloved physician greets you, and also Demas greets you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
4:15	xi2b			ἀσπάσασθε	1	As was customary in this culture, Paul not only extends greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing (as he has done in [4:10–14](../04/10.md)). He also asks the Colossians to extend greetings for him to other people that both he and the Colossians know. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “Remember me to” or “Say hello for me to”
4:15	sc5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς & ἀδελφοὺς	1	The word **brothers** does not refer to only male people. Instead, it refers to both men and women who are part of the group of believers. If **brothers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a word that does not refer to natural gender or you could use both male and female genders. Alternate translation: “the brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:15	zkp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Νύμφαν	1	**Nympha** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:15	wyk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατ’ οἶκον αὐτῆς	1	The phrase **in her house** is a way to indicate that the church used Nympha’s house as their meeting place. If **in her house** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that gathers in her house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:16	zzq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναγνωσθῇ & ἀναγνωσθῇ & ἀναγνῶτε	1	In this culture, letters sent to a group were normally read out loud by one person to everyone else in the group. The words that are translated by **read** in this verse refer to this practice. If you have a way to refer to this practice, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “has been heard … it is heard … hear” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:16	zvor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναγνωσθῇ παρ’ ὑμῖν ἡ ἐπιστολή & ἀναγνωσθῇ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you can express the ideas in active forms by supplying an indefinite subject such as “person” or by expressing the idea with a different verb such as “hear.” Alternate translation: “you have heard this letter … they hear it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:16	q4sz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποιήσατε ἵνα καὶ ἐν τῇ Λαοδικαίων ἐκκλησίᾳ ἀναγνωσθῇ, καὶ τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικίας ἵνα καὶ ὑμεῖς ἀναγνῶτε	1	With these commands, Paul is asking the churches to exchange letters. He wants the Colossians to hear the letter he sent to Laodicea, and he wants the Laodiceans to hear the letter he sent to the Colossians. If you have a specific form to refer to sending and receiving letters, you could use it hear. Alternate translation: “send it off to Laodicea to be read in the church there, and request the letter I sent to them so that you can read it too” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:16	q05z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικίας	1	The phrase **the one from Laodicea** refers to a letter that Paul has already sent or is about to send to the church in Laodicea. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that clarifies that this is a letter from Paul, not one written to Paul. Alternate translation: “the letter I addressed to Laodicea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:17	z330			καὶ εἴπατε	1	In addition to asking the Colossians to greet others for him ([4:15](../04/15.md)), Paul also asks them to **say** something to Archippus. If you have a specific form in your language for instructions on relaying a message, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “And relay this message”
4:17	do70		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀρχίππῳ	1	**Archippus** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
4:17	yy8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	βλέπε τὴν διακονίαν ἣν παρέλαβες ἐν Κυρίῳ, ἵνα αὐτὴν πληροῖς	1	The instruction from Paul to Archippus is written as a direct quote. If your language does not use this form, you can write it as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: “that he must look to the ministry that he has received in the Lord, so that he may fulfill it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
4:17	d39x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	εἴπατε Ἀρχίππῳ, βλέπε τὴν διακονίαν ἣν παρέλαβες ἐν Κυρίῳ, ἵνα αὐτὴν πληροῖς.	1	The words **Look**, **you have received**, and **you may fulfill** all refer to Archippus alone and are singular. However, the word **say** refers to the Colossians and is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
4:17	dy11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βλέπε τὴν διακονίαν	1	Here Paul speaks as if Archippus’ **ministry** were something he can **look to**. By this, he means that he wants Archippus to focus on carrying out his ministry just as if it were something he could stare at. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Focus on the ministry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:17	dau6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τὴν διακονίαν & παρέλαβες	1	Paul does not clarify or even hint at what **the ministry** is or from whom Archippus **received** it. If it is possible, leave this information unclear in your translation. If you must include some extra information, you could clarify that “God” gave him the **ministry** of serving the church. Alternate translation: “the task of serving the church … God gave you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
4:17	uble		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of Archippus with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord** or united to the Lord identifies the situation in which he **received** his **ministry**. He received this **ministry** when he was united to **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “in union with the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:17	ufdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	The phrase **so that** introduces a goal or purpose. Here, it is the purpose for which Archippus should **look to** or stay focused on his ministry. Use a word or phrase that introduces the goal or purpose of a previous statement. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:18	t5js			ὁ ἀσπασμὸς τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ	1	Paul concludes his letter by writing a final greeting to the Colossians. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “I ask to be remembered by my own hand” or “I say hello by my own hand”
4:18	fqek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ	1	In this culture, it was normal for a scribe to write down what the author of the letter was saying. Paul here indicates that he himself is writing these last words. The phrase **by my own hand** means that it was his own hand that took up the pen and wrote. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind **by my own hand**by using a comparable expression or include any extra information needed to make it clear. Alternate translation: “is in my handwriting” or “I write myself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:18	sz0k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Παύλου	1	Here Paul speaks of himself in the third person. He does this to sign his name to the letter, which shows that the letter is from Paul himself and carries his authority. If your language has a specific form for signing letters or documents, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “I am Paul” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
4:18	h3kx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	μου τῶν δεσμῶν	1	Paul speaks of his **chains**, by which he means his imprisonment. If **chains** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or state the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “that I am in jail” or “remember my imprisonment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:18	w2vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	ἡ χάρις μεθ’ ὑμῶν	1	As was customary in his culture, Paul closes his letter with a blessing for the Colossians. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May you experience kindness within you” or “I pray that you will have grace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
4:18	v7qw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ χάρις μεθ’	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **Grace**, you can express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “May God be gracious to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
