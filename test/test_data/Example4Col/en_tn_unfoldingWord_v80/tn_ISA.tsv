front:intro	l9fr				0	# Introduction to Isaiah\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of Isaiah\n\n1. Yahweh judges his people but gives them hope (chapters 1–12)\n1. Isaiah prophesies against many nations (13–23)\n1. Universal judgment and promise of redemption (24–27)\n1. The people of Yahweh judged (28–31)\n1. The righteous kingdom (32–33)\n1. The nations judged; the ransomed will be restored (34–35)\n1. Hezekiah and Sennacherib (36–39)\n1. Yahweh comforts his people and will restore them (40–45)\n1. Prophecies against Babylon (46–48)\n1. The servant of Yahweh (49–55)\n1. Ethics of Yahweh’s kingdom (56–59)\n1. Restored Jerusalem (60–66)\n\n\n### What is the Book of Isaiah about?\n\nThe first part of the Book of Isaiah (chapters 1-39) contains many different prophecies. Some of Isaiah’s prophecies are about how God would send an army to destroy the southern kingdom of Judah. Some of the prophecies are about how God would punish other nations of the world. The end of the first part (chapters 36-39) tells how Isaiah helped King Hezekiah when the Assyrians were about to attack Jerusalem.\n\nThe second part of the Book of Isaiah (chapters 40-66) has prophecies about how God will comfort and restore his people. He will do this through his chosen servant. By the suffering of this servant, God will forgive his people (chapter 53). This servant will also cause Gentiles to worship Yahweh. The Book of Isaiah ends with a prophecy about God creating a new heavens and earth.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators can use the traditional title, “The Book of Isaiah” or just “Isaiah.” Or they may call it “The Book about Isaiah” or “The Sayings of Isaiah.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### When was the Book of Isaiah written?\n\nIsaiah prophesied around 740–700 B.C., when the Assyrian Empire was becoming more powerful. Isaiah spoke the prophecies from God to the people of Judah during the reigns of Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. The story of Isaiah helping King Hezekiah (chapters 36-39) is also found in 2 Kings 19–20.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What did Isaiah prophesy about the future Messiah of Israel?\n\nJews and Christians have interpreted many passages in Isaiah to be about the Messiah. In 9:1-7, Isaiah described a child being born who would rule over David’s kingdom. In chapter 11, Isaiah described a descendant of David who would have God’s spirit upon him. Several prophecies in chapters 40-66 are about “the servant.” This servant will comfort the people, rule righteously, and suffer so that God will forgive the people for sinning against him. The New Testament writers interpret these prophecies to be about Jesus Christ.\n\n### What did Isaiah mean by the “last days”?\n\nIsaiah prophesied of the “last days” (2:2) as some later or final period of time. The New Testament writers understood the “last days” to be the church age (Acts 2:17, Hebrews 1:2). The Book of Isaiah was one of the first books to include prophesies about the last days. Isaiah explained that in the last days there would be a future kingdom of Israel. Jerusalem would be its main city. And people from all over the world will go there to learn about Yahweh and worship him.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What is the meaning of the term “Israel”?\n\nThe name “Israel” is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was the son of Isaac. God changed Jacob’s name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])\n\n### What are some characteristics of prophetic literature in the Book of Isaiah?\n\nMost of Isaiah’s prophecies are in poetic form. Many prophets in Israel used poetry when they spoke important messages that were meant to be remembered.\n\nSometimes Isaiah’s messages are hard to understand. He assumed his original hearers would know what he was talking about. But readers today do not always understand what he meant. However, Isaiah’s basic messages are still clear to us today. These messages are about how God’s people sinned against him, how he would punish them, and how he would eventually comfort and restore them.\n\nIsaiah also speaks about the Servant of Yahweh, in four different poems that are today called the “Four Servant Songs.” Christians understand these very clearly as prophecies about Jesus Christ, the Messiah. These “songs” are in Isaiah 42:1-9; 49:1-7; 50:4-9; and 52:13-53:12. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])
1:intro	q326				0	# Isaiah 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2-31, which is a vision Isaiah receives. These are the words of Yahweh.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Woe\nThe prophecy of this chapter serves as a warning to the people of the kingdom of Judah. If they do not change their evil ways, Yahweh will punish them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/woe]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\nThere are many vivid metaphors used to describe Judah’s sin. Their sin is described as a sickness that spreads. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\nYahweh uses several rhetorical questions in this chapter.

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Animals being present where people once lived\n\nVerse 17 (“Then the sheep will feed as in their own pasture, and in the ruins of the rich people, lambs will graze”) is an example of the Old Testament’s prophets’ habit of describing complete ruin and desolation in terms of a picture of animals--usually wild animals, but here sheep and lambs--living in or feeding in those places. Whether the picture is of flocks or wild animals, the purpose is to say that the human habitation has gone back to wild nature, and that this has happened because of God’s punishment on the people.

24:intro	a6m4				0	# Isaiah 24 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.\n\nWhile it appears that this chapter is a continuation of the prophecy from the previous chapter, it actually looks at the whole of the Assyrian conquest as Yahweh’s punishment on the world. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Covenant\nThe mention of an “everlasting covenant” in this chapter is probably not to a specific covenant with Abraham or Moses. Instead, it is an expectation that mankind would obey Yahweh. Some consider this to be a covenant Yahweh made with Adam. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Reign of Yahweh\nThis chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the Messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator should not add explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action.

28:intro	np8h				0	# Isaiah 28 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\nThere are many metaphors used to describe Yahweh’s punishment as well as the sin of the people of Ephraim. In one such metaphor, they are described as being drunk. Construction and weather metaphors are also used in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “That day”\nThis is a common phrase in this section of Isaiah. This chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the Messiah will reign. This chapter pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator does not need to add an explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action.

31:intro	a5pj				0	# Isaiah 31 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read.

It presents judgments against the people of Ephraim and Judah when they desired to make an alliance with Egypt. It also prophesies the destruction of Assyria. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/woe]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Trust\nThe people were to trust in Yahweh. Only he could provide them with protection. They were punished for their lack of trust when they were in trouble, but Yahweh only required that they trust him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “That day”\nThis is a common phrase in this section of Isaiah.

It can be viewed as bragging to another king about how rich and powerful he was without giving proper credit to Yahweh. Because of this sin, Yahweh punished him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Babylon\nAt this time, Babylon was not very powerful, but was little more than a city.

40:intro	xc5h				0	# Isaiah 40 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\nYahweh uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter. These rhetorical questions help to prove the point he is making and convince the reader. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “She has received double from Yahweh’s hand for all her sins”\nIt is common in many languages to use the feminine “she” to refer to a nation, rather than the word “it,” which is neither masculine or feminine. The translator should use the pronoun that aligns with the common usage in the target language. Therefore, it is acceptable to use “he,” “she,” or “it” in reference to a nation.\n\nThe phrase “received double” indicates that Jerusalem was punished more severely than the other nations. This is because they had the privilege of a special relationship to Yahweh and had more knowledge than the other nations.\n\n### Reign of Yahweh\nThis chapter appears to prophesy about a time of restoration when the Messiah will reign. It pictures a time of great peace and harmony in the world. The translator does not need to add an explanation, but should try to maintain the tense of the original text, as a future or uncompleted action. It does not appear that this prophecy was fulfilled in the days of Isaiah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])

49:intro	j3n4				0	# Isaiah 49 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.\n\nMany scholars believe that there are four songs or poems which Isaiah records about the Messiah. Isaiah 49:1-6 is the second of these songs. They are often called the “servant songs” because they focus on the Messiah being a servant. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### A day of salvation\nIt is unclear if this is a reference to the gospel proclaimed by the Messiah or to the day of restoration of all things.

They are often called the “servant songs” because they focus on the Messiah being a servant. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\nThere are many rhetorical questions in this chapter.

Israelites did not practice castration; foreigners did, sometimes for punishment. Eunuchs who had accepted the Hebrew faith knew that normally they were not allowed to worship in the temple (Deut. 23:1). The full meaning of this statement can be made clear.

The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Fasting\nThe practice of fasting became more common after the exile. This was intended to bring people into a right relationship with God by creating a designated time to concentrate on him. It may have been believed that Yahweh heard people better when they fasted. The significance of fasting is derived from the faster’s attitude of repentance and faith in Yahweh and not the practice itself.
