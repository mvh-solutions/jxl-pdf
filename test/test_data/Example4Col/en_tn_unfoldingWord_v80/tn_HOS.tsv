front:intro	k6lu				0	# Introduction to Hosea\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Hosea\n\n1. God tells Hosea to marry Gomer as a picture of how Israel relates to Yahweh (1:1–3:5)\n1. Israel betrays, wanders, and sins; Yahweh appeals and pleas to return to him (4:1–7:3)\n1. The conflict between Yahweh and Israel explained in various ways (7:4–13:8)\n    * Similes: oven, cake, dove, bow (7:4–16)\n    * Israel openly lies and rebels (8:1–14)\n    * The end of Israel predicted (9:1–17)\n    * Similes: grapes, vine, calf, lion, children, birds, and doves (10:1–11:11)\n    * Israel sins, betrays, and breaks alliances (11:12–12:1)\n    * Israel’s history remembered (12:2–13:16)\n    * Idolatry (13:1–8)\n1. Israel is hostile to Yahweh (13:9–16)\n1. Yahweh’s last appeals to Israel (14:1–9)\n\n### What is the Book of Hosea about?\n\nThis book contains the prophecies of Hosea, son of Beeri. Hosea lived in the northern kingdom of Israel. He often called this kingdom Ephraim or Samaria. Hosea prophesied for about 38 years and predicted that Assyria would destroy the northern kingdom of Israel.\n\nHosea began to prophesy around 753 B.C., just before King Jeroboam II died. At this time, the kingdom of Israel was prosperous but spiritually weak. Hosea warned how Yahweh would punish Israel unless the people turned back to Yahweh and were faithful to him.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book is traditionally named “The Book of Hosea” or just “Hosea.” Translators may also call it “The Book About Hosea” or “The Sayings of Hosea.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Hosea?\n\nAlthough this book tells what Hosea prophesied, it is uncertain whether Hosea wrote the book himself. It was probably written after Samaria, the capital of the norther kingdom, was destroyed in 721 B.C.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why did God command Hosea to marry a prostitute?\n\nGod told Hosea to marry the prostitute Gomer. This represented how the kingdom of Israel related to Yahweh. Israel was unfaithful to Yahweh and broke the covenant with him. This is compared to a woman who is unfaithful to her husband breaks her marriage agreement with him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### What is a lawsuit?\n\nMany cultures have a process for resolving disputes through law courts. These legal disputes are called lawsuits. The Book of Hosea contains some legal terms. This is because Yahweh is spoken of as if he were a husband accusing his wife in court of being unfaithful to him. Part of the Book of Hosea follows the form of a lawsuit. A problem is identified (4:1), someone is accused (4:4), someone is found guilty (4:15), and the guilty ones will be punished (5:1).\n\n### Who did the people of the kingdom of Israel worship?\n\nIsrael was supposed to worship Yahweh alone. But they worshiped both Yahweh and the Canaanite gods such as Baal. This was a major reason why Yahweh judged the kingdom of Israel. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What does the phrase “the declaration of Yahweh” mean?\n\nThe prophet used the phrase “the declaration of Yahweh” to mark a message as truly coming from God.\n\n### Why are English translations of Hosea very different?\n\nHosea 4–14 has many problems of interpretation. Some phrases in Hosea are beyond how we currently understand the Hebrew language. Many English versions have translated these difficult sections very differently.\n\n### What does the term “Israel” mean in Hosea?\n\nIn Hosea, “Israel” is used only to refer to the northern kingdom of Israel. It is not used to refer to the southern kingdom or to the two kingdoms together. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/kingdomofisrael]])
1:intro	ud3c				0	# Hosea 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2-11.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Hosea’s marriage\nGod does not approve of prostitution, but he told Hosea to marry a prostitute so that the message of Israel’s unfaithfulness would be shown to the people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\nHosea’s marriage to Gomer is a metaphor for the kingdom of Israel’s relationship to Yahweh. Israel was unfaithful to Yahweh and broke the covenant with him. Gomer was a woman who was unfaithful to her husband broke her marriage agreement with him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nHosea 1-4 is controlled by a metaphor that Hosea lived out. He was personifying the relationship between Israel and Yahweh. Hosea played the part of Yahweh, and Gomer played the part of Israel.

2:intro	h75z				0	# Hosea 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of this chapter, which is poetry, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. Hosea 1-2 is a single series forming one narrative.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\nMany relationships are used in this chapter that are metaphors for the relationship between Israel and her God. Brother, sister, husband, wife, mother, and children are examples. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\nThis chapter creates an abrupt change of address. The prophet is now addressing the children directly in the first few verses, but the whole chapter is written against Gomer as an illustration of Israel as an adulterous people. God uses Gomer as an illustration to teach the people of Israel how they should be faithful to him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])

3:intro	k2ts				0	# Hosea 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter focuses on the meaning of the illustration of Hosea’s marriage. It is a very short chapter written in prose to show the truth of Israel’s relationship with Yahweh.

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nThis chapter contains a continuation of the metaphor played out in chapter 2. Hosea is told to go and buy his wife out of slavery. Gomer must have been captured and held as a slave due to her adulterous activity. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])

4:intro	m65b				0	# Hosea 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe author stops using the metaphor of a husband/wife relationship and begins using a new illustration using lawsuits. God is suing the people of Israel because of all the wrong they have done. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Lawsuits\n\nLawsuits are special cases where people go to court when they have a legal issue to resolve between them. Normally, one party is accusing another party of having done wrong.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metonymy\n\nMetonymy is used in the first few verses of this chapter. Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or idea is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. Bloodshed is associated with murder. Stumbling represents sinning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Baking\n\nBaking of bread is an extended metaphor in this chapter. Yahweh uses various aspects of this activity to show his displeasure with their sins. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Israel and Ephraim\nThis chapter begins by using two different names for the same group of people: Israel and Ephraim. It also mentions Samaria, which was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel.

7:4	ccn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	They are all adulterers	0	The people committed spiritual adultery by worshiping idols and being unfaithful to Yahweh.

7:5	zte7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	He reached out with his hand	0	This probably means to unite or join with someone. It may mean that the king joins with his officials to mock things or people that should not be mocked, even God himself. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:6	h4zw			General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\nThe court officials’ plotting is described. Their anger is what motivates them to kill their king.

7:8	q1ji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	Ephraim is a flat cake that has not been turned over	0	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Here “Ephraim” refers to the northern kingdom of Israel. The nation is weak, as flat bread that has not been doubled over in the oven by the baker for more strength. Alternate translation: “The people of Ephraim are like a cake that no one has turned over” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

7:9	qta1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	but he does not know it	0	However, this “old age” is clearly a way of saying that the northern kingdom is getting weaker and weaker, because the nation does not know it is “old.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

7:10	l7dg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	The pride of Israel testifies against him	0	This describes “pride” as a person who testifies against the people of Israel in court.

7:10	d1v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	nor have they sought him	0	Israel’s lack of interest in Yahweh is spoken of as if he was lost and they were not trying to find him.

7:15	kf6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Though I trained them and strengthened their arms	0	This may be a military metaphor, in which God training the Israelites to love him and obey him is spoken of as if he had been training their men for war.

Alternate translation: “This is why people in Egypt will mock and laugh at Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:intro	sj97				0	# Hosea 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter continues to use the poetic form to communicate several other ways the people of Israel have sinned against God. First, Yahweh notes that they have set up a king without consulting him.\nNext, they set up or reinstalled the golden calves of Samaria. Last, they were seeking help from other nations like Egypt and Assyria. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\nThis chapter contains some references to the “calf of Samaria.” This most likely refers to an image that was set up by an earlier king of Israel. He did this in order to discourage his people from going to Jerusalem, which was part of the southern kingdom of Judah.
8:1	iyy7			General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\nYahweh is speaking about the coming of the Assyrian army to attack the northern kingdom.

8:5	xu7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Your calf	0	The people worshiped an idol that looked like a calf, so Yahweh is speaking of their worship as if it were the calf itself.

8:9	byr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like a wild donkey all alone	0	People often think of donkeys as being stubborn. This means the people of Israel refused to listen to Yahweh but instead went to the people of Assyria for help. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
8:9	s8b5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Ephraim has hired lovers for herself	0	Ephraim’s alliances with other nations are spoken of as if they had paid them to become prostitutes for Ephraim.

8:12	ww4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	I could write down my law for them ten thousand times, but they would	0	Yahweh is describing a hypothetical situation. Here “ten thousand times” is an exaggeration that means no matter how many times he gave the people the law, they would still refuse to obey him. Alternate translation: “Even if I wrote down my law for them very many times, they would” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

9:intro	lkm6				0	# Hosea 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe chapter is written in poetic form to speak of Yahweh’s displeasure with Israel’s sins. He is showing the many ways in which they do not honor him. The priests and kings do not understand how they have totally broken their covenant with Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Exile\nBecause the covenant has been broken, the people will be exiled into another land. This actually shows the mercy of God toward his people. He did not destroy them; he simply moved them to another place. However, this chapter goes into detail about many parts of their society to show how far they have moved away from truly worshiping Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Change in speaker\nIn verse 16, Yahweh is speaking; but in verse 17, Hosea starts speaking. There is a change in pronouns; the use of “my God” must imply that someone other than Yahweh is speaking.

9:4	ag4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	Their sacrifices will be to them like mourners’ food	0	Here “mourners’ food” refers to what people would eat while they mourning because they were defiled and not acceptable to God.

9:4	yxx6			For their food will be for themselves only; it will not come into the house of Yahweh	0	The people of Israel will have food to eat, but Yahweh will not accept it as a sacrifice.

9:6	x9gb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	if they escape	0	Here “they” still refers to the people of Israel. You can continue stating this is second person. Alternate translation: “if you escape” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

9:7	ns2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane	0	Here “prophet” and “inspired man” both mean a person who claims to receive messages from God.

10:intro	yd8u				0	# Hosea 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is written in poetic form and continues the theme of Israel’s many sins against Yahweh. Even though Israel prospered for a time as they multiplied their sins, Yahweh was leading them toward destruction. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\nYahweh’s relationship to his people was not based on his people’s actions. Even though they rebelled, Yahweh still desired to rescue them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Jacob\n\nThe repeated use of different names for the two kingdoms can be confusing. In verse 11, “Ephraim” refers to the northern kingdom of Israel, and “Judah” refers to the southern kingdom of Judah. However, Jacob is also mentioned. This use of “Jacob” makes us think of the earlier unified nation and may also refer to a future unified nation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

14:intro	bp7t				0	# Hosea 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis last chapter of Hosea ends with hope. In this chapter, Hosea calls for Israel to confess to Yahweh and repent. This chapter continues to be written in poetic form, using metaphors and other devices to communicate God’s love for his sinful people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/confess]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/love]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nWhy are confession and repentance even suggested here for a people that Yahweh has already condemned to be destroyed? It is because this is a teaching that Yahweh is a merciful God who loves his people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Speaker\nThe use of first and second person in this chapter often signifies a change in speaker. In this chapter, Hosea is speaking to the northern kingdom to tell them that Yahweh loves them.\nThere are several places in this chapter where the writer switches from the third person to the second or the first person. This may cause some confusion about who is speaking.
