front:intro	uk55				0	# Introduction to the Gospel of Luke\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Luke\n\n1. Dedication to Theophilus (1:1-4)\n2. Prologue\n    * The birth of John the Baptist (1:5-80)\n   * The birth and youth of Jesus (2:1-51)\n   * The ministry of John the Baptist (3:1-20)\n   * The baptism, genealogy, and temptation of Jesus (3:21-4:13)\n3. The teaching and healing ministry of Jesus in Galilee (4:14-9:50)\n4. Jesus teaches along his journey to Jerusalem\n    * Judgment by God, and people’s judgments about Jesus (9:51-13:21)\n   * Who will be part of the kingdom of God (13:22-17:10)\n   * Responding to Jesus by welcoming or rejecting him (17:11-19:27)\n5. Jesus in Jerusalem\n    * Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem (19:28-44)\n   * Jesus teaches in the temple: conflict over his identity and authority (19:45-21:38)\n   * Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection (22:1-24:53)\n\n### What is the Gospel of Luke about?\n\nThe Gospel of Luke is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Luke wrote his Gospel for a person named Theophilus and dedicated it to him. Luke wrote an accurate description of the life and teachings of Jesus so that Theophilus would be certain that what he had been taught about Jesus was true. However, Luke expected that what he wrote would encourage all followers of Jesus.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Luke” or “The Gospel According to Luke.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Good News About Jesus that Luke Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Luke?\n\nThis book does not give the name of its author. However, the same person who wrote this book also wrote the book of Acts, which is also dedicated to Theophilus. In parts of the book of Acts, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person traveling with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have recognized Luke as the author of both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts.\n\nLuke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. Luke himself probably did not witness what Jesus said and did. But he tells Theophilus in his dedication that he talked to many people who did.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### The kingdom of God\n\n“The kingdom of God” is a major concept in the Gospel of Luke. It is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of God ruling and of people embracing God’s rule over their lives. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating the idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom” with some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])\n\n### Why does Luke write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?\n\nLuke wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### What are the roles of women in the Gospel of Luke?\n\nLuke described women in a very positive way in his Gospel. For example, he often showed women being more faithful to God than most men. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they tell the story of many of the same events. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nPassages are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three Gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This is a reference to [Daniel 7:13-14](../dan/07/13.md). In that passage, there is a person who is described as like a “son of man.” That means that the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to this “son of man” to rule over the nations forever. All people will worship him forever.\n\nJews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. But Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### Major issues in the text of the book of Luke\n\nULT follows the readings of the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. However, there may already be older versions of the Bible in the translators’ regions that follow the readings of other manuscripts. In the most significant cases, the General Notes to the chapters in which these differences occur will discuss them and recommend approaches. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	f1b5				0	# Luke 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Dedication to Theophilus (1:1-4)\n2. The angel Gabriel announces to Zechariah that his wife Elizabeth is going to bear a son, John the Baptist (1:5-25)\n3. The angel Gabriel announces to Mary that she is going to become the mother of Jesus (1:26-38)\n4. Mary goes to visit Elizabeth (1:39-56)\n5. John the Baptist is born (1:57-80)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in Mary’s song about becoming the mother of Jesus in 1:46-55 and Zechariah’s song about the birth of his son John the Baptist in 1:68-79.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “He will be called John”\n\nMost people in the ancient Near East would give a child the same name as someone in their families. People were surprised that Elizabeth and Zechariah named their son John because there was no one else in their family with that name.
1:1	qhd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	περὶ τῶν πεπληροφορημένων ἐν ἡμῖν πραγμάτων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “about those things that have happened among us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:1	hyp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐν ἡμῖν	1	Luke dedicates this book to a man named Theophilus. It is no longer known exactly who he was. But since Luke says in [1:4](../01/04.md) that he wants Theophilus to know that the things he has been taught are reliable, it appears that he was a follower of Jesus. So here the word **us** would include him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1:2	hud2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ & αὐτόπται & γενόμενοι	1	The term **eyewitness** describes someone who saw something happen personally, “with their own eyes.” The term describes such a person figuratively by reference to something associated with sight, the eye. Alternate translation: “who … saw these things personally” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:2	z9dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑπηρέται & τοῦ λόγου	1	Here, **word** figuratively describes the things that the people who brought the message conveyed by using words. Alternate translation: “servants of the message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:2	l000		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑπηρέται & τοῦ λόγου	1	The people who brought this message were actually serving God by doing that. But Luke describes them figuratively as **servants of the word**, as if they were serving the message from God. Alternate translation: “served God by telling people his message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:3	fud1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	παρηκολουθηκότι ἄνωθεν πᾶσιν ἀκριβῶς	1	Luke provides this background information to explain that he was careful to find out exactly what happened. He probably talked to different people who saw what happened to make sure that what he wrote down about these events was correct. Alternate translation: “because I have conducted careful research and interviews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:3	l001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	σοι & κράτιστε Θεόφιλε	1	If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, it would be appropriate to use that form here. There are many other places in the book of Luke where your language might use formal **you**, and these notes will not address all of them. Rather, as you translate, use formal and informal **you** in the way that would be most natural in your language. The notes will address a few cases where a careful decision should be made between the two forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
1:3	nr63			κράτιστε Θεόφιλε	1	Luke is dedicating this work to Theophilus, and within his dedication, this is the conventional personal greeting. If it would be more customary in your language and culture, you could put this greeting in [1:1](../01/01.md) at the start of the dedication, at the very beginning of the book. Alternate translation: “To most excellent Theophilus”
1:3	vhj8			κράτιστε	1	Luke uses the term **most excellent** to address Theophilus in a way that shows honor and respect. This may mean that Theophilus was an important government official. In your translation, it would be appropriate to use the form of address that your culture uses for people of high status. Alternate translation: “Honorable”
1:3	h7q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Θεόφιλε	1	This name means “friend of God.” It may describe this man’s character, or it may have been his actual name. Most translations treat it as a name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:4	l002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὧν κατηχήθης λόγων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “what people have taught you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:4	l003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὧν κατηχήθης λόγων	1	Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that he means what he has been **taught** about Jesus. Alternate translation: “what people have taught you about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:5	gb16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις Ἡρῴδου βασιλέως τῆς Ἰουδαίας	1	This time reference introduces a new event. Alternate translation: “During the time when King Herod ruled over Judea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
1:5	l004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Here, Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular period of time. Alternate translation: “During the time when” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:5	l005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἡρῴδου	1	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:5	l006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰουδαίας	1	**Judea** is the name of a kingdom. (It was not an independent kingdom at this time. Herod ruled it as a vassal of the Roman Empire.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:5	a4q9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐγένετο & ἱερεύς τις	1	This phrase introduces a new character in a story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
1:5	l007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ζαχαρίας	1	**Zechariah** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:5	l228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξ ἐφημερίας Ἀβιά	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that this expression refers one of the different groups of priests who each served in the temple for a certain number of days at a time, and that the name of the group means that Abijah was the ancestor of these priests. Alternate translation: “who belonged to the group of priests who were descended from Abijah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:5	gzw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀβιά	1	**Abijah** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:5	d3ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γυνὴ αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρών	1	Here, the word **daughters** figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “his wife was a descendant of Aaron” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:5	nnu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τῶν θυγατέρων Ἀαρών	1	This means implicitly that she, like Zechariah, was descended from the line of priests going back to Aaron, the first high priest. Alternate translation: “his wife also came from the line of priests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:5	l008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἐλεισάβετ	1	**Elizabeth** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:6	uu87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Luke uses this expression to mean “where God could see them.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in God’s judgment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:6	l009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πορευόμενοι ἐν πάσαις ταῖς ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασιν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	The term **walking** figuratively means “obeying.” Alternate translation: “obeying … everything that the Lord had commanded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:6	csc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πάσαις ταῖς ἐντολαῖς καὶ δικαιώμασιν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	The words **commandments** and **statutes** mean similar things. Luke uses the two terms together to make a comprehensive statement. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “everything that the Lord had commanded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:7	c7cj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	This word indicates a contrast, showing that what follows is the opposite of what would be expected. People expected that if they did what was right, God would allow them to have children. Although this couple did what was right, they did not have any children. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1:7	l010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν	1	To have moved forward or to have **advanced** means figuratively to have aged. Alternate translation: “they had both grown old” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:7	l011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀμφότεροι προβεβηκότες ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῶν	1	Here, Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time, the lifetimes of Zechariah and Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “they had both grown old” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:8	jr7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	This phrase marks a shift from the background information that Luke has been providing about the participants to the first event in their story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses to introduce an event, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
1:8	l012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν, ἐν τῇ τάξει τῆς ἐφημερίας αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the results that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because it was his group’s turn, Zechariah was serving as a priest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:8	vyl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν & ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The expression **before God**, that is, “in front of God,” means that Zechariah was offering his service as a priest in the presence of God. Alternate translation: “while Zechariah was serving God as a priest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:8	abc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν τῷ ἱερατεύειν αὐτὸν	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Zechariah. Alternate translation: “while Zechariah was serving as a priest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:8	wed9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἐν τῇ τάξει τῆς ἐφημερίας αὐτοῦ	1	This is background information that explains why Zechariah was serving as a priest at this time. Alternate translation: “because it was his group’s turn to serve” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:9	vq5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς ἱερατείας, ἔλαχε	1	Luke is providing background information about how the priests selected members of their group to perform specific duties. Alternate translation: “The priests chose him in their customary way, by casting a lot” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:9	pa9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἔλαχε	1	A **lot** was a marked stone that was thrown or rolled on the ground in order to help decide something. The priests believed that God would guide the lot and show them which priest he wanted them to choose for a particular duty. If your culture has a similar object, you could use the word for that in your language here. Alternate translation: “by casting a marked stone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:9	l013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι, εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὸν ναὸν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	ULT puts these phrases in the chronological order of what Zechariah needed to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put them in logical order instead. Alternate translation: “to burn incense, and so he went into the temple to do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:9	ph9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῦ θυμιᾶσαι	1	The word **incense** describes a substance that gives off a sweet smell when it is burned. The priests were to burn it as an offering to God each morning and evening on a special altar inside the temple. If your language has a word for this substance, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “to burn a substance that would create a sweet smell as an offering to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
1:10	bjl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶν τὸ πλῆθος & τοῦ λαοῦ	1	This expression, if taken literally, could mean every single one of the Jews, but it is actually a generalization that Luke is using to emphasize how big this crowd was. Alternate translation: “A large number of people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1:10	ntl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔξω	1	This word refers implicitly to the enclosed area or courtyard that surrounded the temple. Alternate translation: “in the courtyard outside the temple building” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:10	uwu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ὥρᾳ τοῦ θυμιάματος	1	The word **hour** figuratively means “time.” This could mean either the morning or evening time for the incense offering. Alternate translation: “when it was time to offer the incense” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:11	b8b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δὲ	1	This word indicates that the event it introduces took place at the same time as the event the story has just related. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this relationship by using a phrase such as “right at that time.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1:11	c8ss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὤφθη & αὐτῷ	1	When Luke says that the angel **appeared**, this does not mean that Zechariah simply saw the angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Zechariah. Alternate translation: “suddenly was there with Zechariah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:12	r3aa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐταράχθη Ζαχαρίας & φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Luke is using them together to emphasize how afraid Zechariah was. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Zechariah became very afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:12	d1zm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰδών	1	The implication is that Zechariah was afraid because the angel appeared glorious and powerful. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. (Luke has just said that Zechariah was righteous and blameless, so it would be good not to leave your readers with the impression that he had done something wrong and was afraid that the angel was going to punish him for it.) Alternate translation: “when he saw how glorious and powerful the angel was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:12	l014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	Luke is using the expression **fell upon** figuratively to speak of fear as if it attacked and overcame Zechariah. Alternate translation: “this made him very afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:12	sfb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	φόβος ἐπέπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	Luke describes Zechariah’s **fear** figuratively as if it were something that could actively attack and overpower him. Alternate translation: “this made him very afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
1:13	ki8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μὴ φοβοῦ	1	While the angel speaks these words in the form of a command, he is actually telling Zechariah something to help and encourage him. Alternate translation: “You do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1:13	es4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has heard your prayer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:13	l015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰσηκούσθη ἡ δέησίς σου	1	This is an idiom that means that God is going to give Zechariah what he has been asking for. Alternate translation: “God is going to give you what you have been asking for” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:13	l016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	καὶ καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωάννην	1	The angel is using a statement as a command in order to tell Zechariah what to do. Alternate translation: “and you are to name him John” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
1:13	l017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰωάννην	1	The expression **call his name** is an idiom that means to give a child a name. Alternate translation: “name him John” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:13	l018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωάννην	1	**John** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:14	n654		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἔσται χαρά σοι καὶ ἀγαλλίασις	1	The words **joy** and **gladness** mean the same thing. The angel uses them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “you will be very happy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:14	q1p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπὶ τῇ γενέσει αὐτοῦ	1	The word **at** introduces the reason why many people will rejoice. Alternate translation: “because he has been born” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:15	td57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔσται γὰρ μέγας	1	The word **for** introduces the reason why people will rejoice at John's birth. Alternate translation: “This will be because they will be able to tell that he is going to be a great man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:15	sz79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔσται γὰρ μέγας ἐνώπιον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	This expression means “in front of the Lord,” that is, “where the Lord can see him.” Sight, in turn, figuratively represents attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “God will consider him to be very important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:15	abc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ πίῃ	1	The phrase **must never** translates two negative words in Greek. The angel uses them together to emphasize how important it is that the child not drink wine or strong drink. If your language can use two negatives together for emphasis without them cancelling each other to create a positive meaning, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1:15	hgb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will fill him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:15	l019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου πλησθήσεται	1	The angel speaks figuratively as if John would be a container that the Holy Spirit would fill. He means that the Holy Spirit will empower and influence John. Be sure that in your translation, this does not sound similar to what an evil spirit might do to in taking control of a person. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will empower him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:15	ie95			ἔτι ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “while he is still in his mother’s womb”

Alternate translation: “he will cause many of the people of Israel to repent and obey the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:16	l020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πολλοὺς τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραὴλ	1	Here, the word **sons** figuratively means “descendants.” This expression envisions all of the Israelites as if they were their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “many of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:16	l021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰσραὴλ	1	**Israel** is the name of a man. Luke uses it many times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:17	c52s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτὸς προελεύσεται ἐνώπιον αὐτοῦ	1	To **go before** is an idiom that indicates that before the Lord comes, John will announce to the people that the Lord is going to come to them. Alternate translation: “John will announce that the Lord is coming” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:17	p472		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἠλεία	1	In this context, the words **spirit** and **power** mean similar things. The angel may be using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “with the same great power that Elijah had” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:17	l022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐν πνεύματι καὶ δυνάμει Ἠλεία	1	Alternatively, the angel may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The term **power** may tell what kind of **spirit** Elijah had. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “in the powerful spirit of Elijah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1:17	l023		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἠλεία	1	**Elijah** is the name of a man, a great prophet of Israel. It occurs several times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

1:17	qe48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα	1	The angel uses the relationship between **fathers** and **children** figuratively to represent all relationships. Luke relates in [3:10-14](../03/10.md) how John encouraged reconciliation in a variety of different relationships. Alternate translation: “to restore broken relationships” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1:17	l024		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιστρέψαι καρδίας πατέρων ἐπὶ τέκνα	1	It is assumed that readers will know that this is what the prophet Malachi had said Elijah would do before the Lord came. The implication in context is that John will fulfill this prophecy by using the same empowerment that Elijah had. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to restore broken relationships, just as the prophet Malachi said Elijah would do before the Lord came” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:17	l025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπειθεῖς ἐν φρονήσει δικαίων	1	Gabriel is using the term **wisdom** in the Old Testament sense as a moral term that refers to choosing the way in life that God has shown to be best. The people who make this choice are **righteous**, meaning that God considers them to be living in the right way. Alternate translation: “to lead people who are disobeying God to choose his ways and become people who live right” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:17	j49j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀπειθεῖς & δικαίων	1	Gabriel is using the adjectives **disobedient** and **righteous** as nouns in order to indicate groups of people.

1:17	ujs1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λαὸν κατεσκευασμένον	1	You could state explicitly in your translation what the people will be prepared to do. Alternate translation: “a people who will be prepared to believe his message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:18	asn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατὰ τί γνώσομαι τοῦτο	1	Zechariah is implicitly asking for a sign as proof. Alternate translation: “What sign can you show me to prove that this will happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:18	l026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	This word introduces the reason why Zechariah wants a sign. He and his wife are both too old to have children, so he is finding it hard to believe what the angel has told him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:18	l027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	προβεβηκυῖα ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις αὐτῆς	1	Zechariah is using two idioms. As in [1:7](../01/07.md), to be **advanced** means figuratively to have aged, and **days** figuratively refers a particular period of time, in this case the lifetime of Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “my wife has also grown old” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:19	l028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἄγγελος εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the angel responded to the question that Zechariah asked. Alternate translation: “the angel responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1:19	p3jn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἐγώ εἰμι Γαβριὴλ, ὁ παρεστηκὼς ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Gabriel says this in the form of a statement, but he means it as a rebuke to Zechariah. The presence of an angel coming directly from God should be enough proof for him. Alternate translation: “You should have believed me, Gabriel, coming to you straight from God!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
1:19	l029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Γαβριὴλ	1	**Gabriel** is the name of an angel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:19	yp6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ παρεστηκὼς ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	To stand **before** or “in front of” a master, that is, in the presence of that master, figuratively means to be available to serve them at all times in any capacity.

1:19	pd7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπεστάλην λαλῆσαι πρὸς σὲ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God sent me to speak to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:20	x9qk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ	1	The term **behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” in this case seeing figuratively means giving notice and attention. Alternate translation: “Pay attention!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:20	l030		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔσῃ σιωπῶν καὶ μὴ δυνάμενος λαλῆσαι	1	The implication is that God will make this happen, to show that Zechariah should have believed what Gabriel told him. Alternate translation: “God will make you completely unable to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:20	g5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σιωπῶν καὶ μὴ δυνάμενος λαλῆσαι	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Gabriel uses the repetition to emphasize how complete the silence of Zechariah will be. Alternate translation: “completely unable to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1:20	q6y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐπίστευσας τοῖς λόγοις μου	1	Gabriel uses the term **words** figuratively to describe the content of his message by reference to something associated with it, the words he used to communicate it.

1:20	l031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἵτινες πληρωθήσονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “which will happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

1:21	e14e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	καὶ	1	This word marks a shift in the story from what happened inside the temple to what happened outside.

1:22	h6vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι ὀπτασίαν ἑώρακεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ. καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν διανεύων αὐτοῖς, καὶ διέμενεν κωφός	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “He kept on making signs to them but said nothing. So they concluded that he must have seen a vision while he was in the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:22	r2ak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπέγνωσαν ὅτι ὀπτασίαν ἑώρακεν ἐν τῷ ναῷ	1	Gabriel was actually present with Zechariah in the temple. He explains in [1:19](../01/19.md) that God sent him there. The people, not knowing this, assumed that Zechariah had seen a vision. While the Greek says that they “perceived” this, it means that they thought they recognized what had happened. Alternate translation: “they thought that he had seen a vision” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:23	duy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
1:23	l032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς ἐπλήσθησαν αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς λειτουργίας αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “when Zechariah had finished his time of service at the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:23	l033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αἱ ἡμέραι τῆς λειτουργίας αὐτοῦ	1	Here, Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “his time of service at the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:23	sa5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	This expression indicates implicitly that Zechariah did not live in Jerusalem, where the temple was located. Luke indicates in [1:39](../01/39.md) that Zechariah and Elizabeth lived instead in a city in the hill country of Judah, the area to the south of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “he traveled back to his hometown” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:24	l034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	δὲ	1	This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the events it has just described. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
1:24	cda2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μετὰ δὲ ταύτας τὰς ἡμέρας	1	Here, Luke uses the term **days** to refer figuratively to a particular period of time, specifically, the time when Zechariah was serving in the temple. Alternate translation: “after Zechariah had finished serving at the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:24	kpw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περιέκρυβεν ἑαυτὴν μῆνας πέντε	1	This expression means that Elizabeth did not leave her house during that time. She seems to state the reason for this in the next verse. She had felt disgraced because she was not able to have children. But if she stayed in her house for **five months**, the next time people saw her, her pregnancy would show, and it would be clear that she was able to have children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “She did not leave her house for five months so that by the next time people saw her, it would be clear that she was going to have a baby” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:25	w8yq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	οὕτως μοι πεποίηκεν Κύριος	1	This is a positive exclamation. Elizabeth is very happy with what the Lord has done for her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this by making it a separate sentence and indicating with the conventions of your language that it is an exclamation. Alternate translation: “What a marvelous thing the Lord has done for me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
1:25	z1xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὕτως μοι πεποίηκεν Κύριος	1	It is implicit that Elizabeth is referring to the fact that the Lord has allowed her to become pregnant. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “What a marvelous thing the Lord has done for me by allowing me to become pregnant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:25	pn2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐπεῖδεν	1	Here, the expression **looked upon** is an idiom that means “shown regard for” or “treated well.” Alternate translation: “he treated me kindly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:25	lx3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀφελεῖν ὄνειδός μου ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1	By **disgrace**, Elizabeth means the shame she felt because she was not able to have children. Alternate translation: “so that I no longer have to feel ashamed when I am around other people because I cannot have children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:26	v9w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν & τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ	1	Luke assumes that readers will recognize that this does not mean the sixth month of the year, but the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy. If you think there could be some confusion about this, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “after Elizabeth had been pregnant for six months” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:26	l035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τῷ μηνὶ τῷ ἕκτῳ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “month 6” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
1:26	rl4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπεστάλη ὁ ἄγγελος Γαβριὴλ ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God sent the angel Gabriel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:26	l036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Γαλιλαίας	1	**Galilee** is the name of a region. It occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:26	l037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ναζαρὲτ	1	**Nazareth** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:27	l038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀνδρὶ, ᾧ ὄνομα Ἰωσὴφ	1	This introduces Joseph as a new character in the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
1:27	l039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ	1	**Joseph** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:27	tzh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξ οἴκου Δαυεὶδ	1	In this expression, the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants figuratively as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “who was a descendant of King David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:27	l040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἐξ οἴκου Δαυεὶδ	1	This is background information that helps identify Joseph further. It is important for readers to know because it means that as [1:32](../01/32.md) indicates, Jesus, as the adoptive son of Joseph, will be an eligible successor to King David as the Messiah. Alternate translation: “who came from the royal line of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
1:27	w9tm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	τὸ ὄνομα τῆς παρθένου Μαριάμ	1	This introduces Mary as a new character in the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
1:27	l041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαριάμ	1	**Mary** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:28	i7h4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	χαῖρε	1	This word was used as a greeting. Alternate translation: “Greetings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:28	bp2n			κεχαριτωμένη	1	Alternate translation: “you who have received great grace” or “you who have received special kindness”
1:28	jmq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ Κύριος μετὰ σοῦ	1	The expression **with you** is an idiom that indicates favor and acceptance. Alternate translation: “The Lord is pleased with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:29	l042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ λόγῳ	1	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to mean what Gabriel said by using words. Alternate translation: “by what he said” or “when he said this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

1:30	l043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	μὴ φοβοῦ, Μαριάμ; εὗρες γὰρ χάριν παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “God is showing you his kindness, Mary, so you do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:30	d3rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μὴ φοβοῦ	1	While the angel speaks these words in the form of a command, he is actually telling Mary something that he thinks will help and encourage her. Alternate translation: “You do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
1:30	a3eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὗρες & χάριν παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God is showing you his kindness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:31	l044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ	1	As in [1:20](../01/20.md), **behold** is a term that focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:31	fi5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	συνλήμψῃ ἐν γαστρὶ, καὶ τέξῃ υἱόν	1	The phrase **conceive in your womb** might seem to express unnecessary extra information, and so if you represent all of it in your language, that might not seem natural. However, the details are important here. The expression emphasizes that Jesus was a human son born of a human mother. So be sure to translate this expression in a way that conveys that. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1:31	l045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦν	1	As in [1:13](../01/13.md), Gabriel is using a statement as a command in order to tell Mary what to do. Alternate translation: “you are to name him Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
1:31	l046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καλέσεις τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ Ἰησοῦν	1	As in [1:13](../01/13.md), **call his name** is an idiom that means to give a child a name. Alternate translation: “name him Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:31	l047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰησοῦν	1	This is a man’s name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:32	l048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου κληθήσεται	1	To **be called** is an idiom that means “to be.” (This idiom occurs three times in this episode and in a few other places in the book, such as [1:76](../01/76.md), [2:23](../02/23.md), and [15:19](../15/19.md).) Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:32	hl55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου κληθήσεται	1	Gabriel is not saying only that **Son of the Most High** is a title by which Jesus will be known. Instead, just as the previous verse described how Jesus was a human son born of a human mother, his statement here indicates that Jesus was also the divine Son of a divine Father. You may want to show this by employing capitalization or whatever other convention your language uses to indicate divinity. Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:32	ip26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Υἱὸς Ὑψίστου κληθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “He will be the Son of the Most High” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:32	z74z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	This is an idiomatic way of referring to God, as the fuller expression “the Most High God” in [8:38](../08/38.md) shows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the phrase that way in order to explain its meaning. Or, you could simply reproduce the phrase in the simpler form in which it occurs here in order to show your readers one of the ways in which the people of this time referred to God. Alternate translation: “the Most High God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:32	lwd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	δώσει αὐτῷ & τὸν θρόνον Δαυεὶδ, τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	The **throne** figuratively represents a king’s authority to rule. Alternate translation: “will give him authority to rule as king as his ancestor David did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:32	l049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δώσει αὐτῷ & τὸν θρόνον Δαυεὶδ, τοῦ πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the term **father** figuratively means “ancestor,” but since a line of kings is in view, it also indicates that Jesus will be a successor to David. Alternate translation: “will give him authority to rule as a successor to his ancestor David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:33	l050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	βασιλεύσει & εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας; καὶ τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Gabriel uses them together to emphasize how certain it is that Jesus will always rule. Because Gabriel is making a proclamation, he is speaking in a form much like poetry. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “he will rule … forever, yes, his kingship will always continue” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:33	l051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον Ἰακὼβ	1	In this expression, the word **house** figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person, in this case Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people descended from Jacob” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:33	l052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰακὼβ	1	**Jacob** is the name of a man. Luke uses it a few more times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:33	l053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	This is an idiom. The term **ages** means long periods of time. Alternate translation: “forever” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:33	q516		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	This is a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “his kingship will always continue” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
1:33	l054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ, οὐκ ἔσται τέλος	1	The abstract noun **kingship** refers to the action of a king reigning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this word with a verb such as “reign.” Alternate translation: “he will always reign” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:34	cf3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πῶς ἔσται τοῦτο	1	The implication is that even though Mary did not understand how this could happen, she did not doubt that it would happen. This is clear from the way that Gabriel responds positively and encouragingly to her, by contrast to the way he rebuked Zechariah in [1:18](../01/18.md) for his similar-sounding question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I believe you, though I do not understand how this could happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:34	fqt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ἄνδρα οὐ γινώσκω	1	Mary uses a polite expression to say that she had not engaged in sexual activity. Alternate translation: “I have never had sexual relations with a man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1:35	l055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ ἄγγελος εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the angel responded to the question that Mary asked. Alternate translation: “the angel responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1:35	l056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον ἐπελεύσεται ἐπὶ σέ, καὶ δύναμις Ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Once again Gabriel is speaking in a form much like Hebrew poetry. It would be good here as well to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a term other than **and**, in order to show that the second phrase is repeating and clarifying the meaning of the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The Holy Spirit will come to you, yes, the power of God will cover you like a shadow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:35	x53s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δύναμις Ὑψίστου ἐπισκιάσει σοι	1	It was the **power** of God that would supernaturally cause Mary to become pregnant even while she still remained a virgin. It is not clear exactly how this happened, since Gabriel speaks figuratively as if God’s power had a shadow in order to describe it. But make sure that your translation does not imply that there was any physical or sexual union involved. This was a miracle. It might work well to retain Gabriel’s language and change the metaphor to a simile. Alternate translation: “the power of the Most High will cover you like a shadow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:35	l057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). Alternate translation: “the Most High God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:35	l058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	As in [1:32](../01/32.md), to **be called** is an idiom that means “to be.” Alternate translation: “Therefore, this holy baby will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:35	k866		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	διὸ καὶ τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	Gabriel is not saying only that **Son of God** is a title by which Jesus will be known. Instead, this is a further statement that Jesus would be the divine Son of a divine Father. (Gabriel says **therefore**, indicating that this will be the result of the process he has just described.) You may want to show this by employing capitalization or whatever other convention your language uses to indicate divinity. Alternate translation: “Therefore, this holy baby will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:35	vrz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these two passive forms by stating the meaning of each with an active form. Alternate translation: “people will call this holy baby whom you will bear the Son of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:35	l059		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	τὸ γεννώμενον Ἅγιον κληθήσεται, Υἱὸς Θεοῦ	1	Depending on how the Greek is understood, this could be another parallel statement. Alternate translation: “The one who will be born will be holy. Yes, he will be the Son of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:36	lx9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	**Behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Consider this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:36	f88l			καὶ αὐτὴ συνείληφεν υἱὸν ἐν γήρει αὐτῆς	1	Make sure that your translation does not make it does not sound as if both Mary and Elizabeth were old when they conceived. Alternate translation: “she has also become pregnant with a son, even though she is already very old”
1:36	hck2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὗτος μὴν ἕκτος ἐστὶν αὐτῇ	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “she is now in the sixth month of her pregnancy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:36	l060		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῇ καλουμένῃ στείρᾳ	1	This is a further use of the idiom also found in [1:32](../01/32.md) and [1:35](../01/35.md) in which “to be called” means “to be.” Alternate translation: “who was not able to have children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “God is able to do anything he says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1:37	l061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἀδυνατήσει παρὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ πᾶν ῥῆμα	1	Here, the term **word** could mean: (1) since Mary uses the same term figuratively in the next verse to describe the message that Gabriel has brought from God, Gabriel may be using it to mean that message as well. Alternate translation: “God is able to do anything he says” (2) Gabriel may be using the term in a general sense to mean “thing.” Alternate translation: “everything is possible with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:38	tef1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Here, **behold** means more literally “look,” that is, “Look at me,” by which Mary means, “This is who I am.” Alternate translation (not followed by a comma): “I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:38	kw3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ δούλη Κυρίου	1	By describing herself as a **servant**, Mary is responding humbly and willingly.

1:39	ka5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ & ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	This time reference sets the stage for a new episode in the story. Alternate translation: “Around that same time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

1:41	bx82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. One method that is natural in some languages is to introduce this event without such a phrase. UST often models this approach. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
1:41	v99g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ κοιλίᾳ αὐτῆς	1	The pronoun **her** refers to Elizabeth. Alternate translation: “in Elizabeth’s womb” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

2:intro	dw6t				0	# Luke 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus is born in the city of Bethlehem (2:1-20)\n2. Joseph and Mary dedicate Jesus, and Simeon and Anna speak about him (2:21-40)\n3. Jesus goes to Jerusalem with his parents for Passover (2:41-52)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in the song of the angels about Jesus’ birth in 2:14 and in Simeon’s song about Jesus in 2:29-32.\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “his father and mother”\n\nIn [2:33](../02/33.md), the most accurate ancient manuscripts read “his father and mother.” ULT follows that reading. Some other ancient manuscripts read “Joseph and his mother.” That reading indicates that Joseph was not the biological father of Jesus, since Mary conceived him as a virgin. However, Joseph was the adoptive father of Jesus, and so the reading “his father and mother” is not incorrect. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading in ULT.

2:4	kz78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς πόλιν Δαυεὶδ, ἥτις καλεῖται Βηθλέεμ	1	Bethlehem was known as **the city of David** because King David had come from there.

Alternate translation: “he was descended from the royal line of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
2:4	s7a7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἶναι αὐτὸν ἐξ οἴκου καὶ πατριᾶς Δαυείδ	1	As in [1:27](../01/27.md), the word **house** figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person.

2:5	ne7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Μαριὰμ, τῇ ἐμνηστευμένῃ αὐτῷ	1	In this culture, an engaged couple was considered legally married, although there would not have been physical intimacy between them until after the wedding.

2:7	s97r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνέκλινεν αὐτὸν ἐν φάτνῃ	1	A **manger** was a box or frame in which people put hay or other food for animals to eat. It was most likely clean, and it may have had something soft and dry like hay in it that would have provided a cushion for the baby. In this culture, animals were often kept near a home to keep them safe and so that their owners could feed them easily. Mary and Joseph stayed in a space that was ordinarily used for animals for those reasons. Alternate translation: “put him in a box that held hay for animals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
2:7	yj6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διότι οὐκ ἦν αὐτοῖς τόπος ἐν τῷ καταλύματι	1	There was probably **no room** because so many people had come to Bethlehem to register.

2:42	d52y			κατὰ τὸ ἔθος τῆς ἑορτῆς	1	Alternate translation: “when it was time for the feast”
2:42	g8aa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς ἑορτῆς	1	Implicitly this means the Feast of Passover. It was called a **feast** because it involved eating a ceremonial meal. Alternate translation: “of the Feast of Passover” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

2:46	llz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
2:46	yy11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Since only priests could enter the **temple** building, this implicitly means the **temple** courtyard.

Alternate translation: “all those who heard him, unable to understand how a twelve-year-old boy with no formal religious education could answer so well, were amazed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:47	pgu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐπὶ τῇ συνέσει καὶ ταῖς ἀποκρίσεσιν αὐτοῦ	1	Luke may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The term **understanding** may tell what characterized Jesus’ **answers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “at his wise answers” or “at the understanding with which he answered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
2:48	llk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ ἰδόντες αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “When Mary and Joseph found Jesus there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

2:49	l165		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to draw a contrast between how readers might have expected Jesus to respond in this situation and how he actually responded.

2:49	r8eh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι ἐζητεῖτέ με?	1	Jesus is making a statement, not really asking a question. He is using the question form to challenge his parents respectfully.

He is using the question form to challenge his parents respectfully. Alternate translation: “You should have known that I would be involved in my Father’s business” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:49	p6aj			ἐν τοῖς τοῦ πατρός μου	1	This could mean: (1) Jesus is saying that he needed to be involved in the things that God was concerned about.

2:50	l166		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ῥῆμα ὃ ἐλάλησεν αὐτοῖς	1	The term **word** refers figuratively to what Jesus told his parents by using words. Alternate translation: “the answer that he gave them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:51	h2i9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καὶ κατέβη μετ’ αὐτῶν	1	Jerusalem was on top of a mountain, so Israelites customarily spoke of going **down** when they traveled from Jerusalem to some other place. Alternate translation: “Jesus went back home with Mary and Joseph” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:51	zl2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἦν ὑποτασσόμενος αὐτοῖς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he obeyed them” or “he was obedient to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:51	ceu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διετήρει πάντα τὰ ῥήματα ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτῆς	1	As in [2:19](../02/19.md), the **heart** here figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “carefully remembered all these things” or “reflected carefully on what all these things meant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:52	gb25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Ἰησοῦς προέκοπτεν τῇ σοφίᾳ, καὶ ἡλικίᾳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract nouns **wisdom** and **stature** with adjectives.

2:52	y5qk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάριτι παρὰ Θεῷ καὶ ἀνθρώποις	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **favor** with verbs. The phrase **in favor with God and people** refers to spiritual and social growth. Alternate translation: “God blessed him more and more, and people admired him more and more” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:intro	tkg5				0	# Luke 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. John the Baptist begins preaching and baptizing (3:1-22)\n2. The list of Jesus’ ancestors (3:23-38)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in 3:4-6, which Luke is quoting from the Old Testament about John the Baptist.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Justice\n\nJohn’s instructions to the soldiers and tax collectors in Luke 3:12-15 are things that a person who wanted to live rightly would find reasonable and willingly do. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and Luke [3:12-15](./12.md))\n\n### Genealogy\n\nA genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Such lists were very important in determining who had the right be king, because the king’s authority was usually passed down or inherited from his father. It was also common for other important people to have a recorded genealogy.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nProphecy often involves the use of metaphors to express its meaning. Spiritual discernment is needed for proper interpretation of the prophecy. The prophecy that Luke quotes in 3:4-6 from Isaiah 40:3-5 is an extended metaphor that describes the ministry of John the Baptist. See the individual notes to 3:4-6 for recommendations about how to translate this passage. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Herod locked up John in prison”\n\nThis statement could cause confusion because Luke says that John was imprisoned, and then he implies that John was still able to baptize Jesus. But Luke makes this statement in anticipation of Herod’s imprisonment of John. It describes something that was still in the future at the time of the other events in the narrative. See the first note to 3:19 for a further explanation.
3:1	l167		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ τῆς ἡγεμονίας Τιβερίου Καίσαρος	1	This verse and the beginning of the next one are an extended time reference that introduces a new event. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Everything that the angels and inspired people had said about John and Jesus began to come true during the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
3:1	l168		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “in year 15” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
3:1	l169		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Τιβερίου Καίσαρος	1	As in [2:1](../02/01.md), **Caesar** is the title of the emperor of the Roman Empire. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Tiberius, who ruled the Roman Empire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
3:1	l170		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Τιβερίου	1	**Tiberius** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:1	v22w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ποντίου Πειλάτου & Ἡρῴδου & Φιλίππου & Λυσανίου	1	These are the names of men. Here, the **Herod** mentioned is not the same one as in [1:5](../01/05.md). Rather, it is his son. Luke makes further mention of him many times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:1	uv8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῆς Ἰουδαίας & τῆς Γαλιλαίας & τῆς Ἰτουραίας καὶ Τραχωνίτιδος & τῆς Ἀβειληνῆς	1	These are names of territories. Like **Galilee**, the name **Judea** occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:1	l171		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τετραρχοῦντος	1	In the Roman Empire, a **tetrarch** was the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “ruler” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:2	d3m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ ἀρχιερέως Ἅννα καὶ Καϊάφα	1	Usually there would only have been one high priest, but at this point the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea, and there had been some intrigue surrounding Annas. One Roman official had appointed him some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son-in-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’ claim to the position. It would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible for your readers. Alternate translation: “while Annas and Caiaphas were both serving as the high priest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:2	dg8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Θεοῦ	1	Luke speaks of God’s message figuratively as if it were a living thing that could come to a person at God's bidding. Alternate translation: “God gave a message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
3:2	l172		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐγένετο ῥῆμα Θεοῦ	1	The term **word** figuratively describes the message that God gave John to say by using words. Alternate translation: “God gave a message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:3	l173		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:3	l174		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τοῦ Ἰορδάνου	1	**Jordan** is the name of a river. Alternate translation: “the Jordan River” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
3:3	w2pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract nouns **baptism**, **repentance**, and **forgiveness** with other phrases. Alternate translation: “preaching that people should let him immerse them in the river to show that they wanted to live a new life and that they wanted God to forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:4	zf6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ λόγων Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “As the book says that records the sayings of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:4	l175		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγων Ἠσαΐου τοῦ προφήτου	1	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to refer to the sayings that Isaiah used words to articulate. Alternate translation: “the sayings of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:4	b86g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	From this phrase through to the end of [3:6](../03/06.md), Luke quotes from the book of Isaiah. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:4	l176		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	The term **voice** refers figuratively to what this person is saying by association with the means they are using to say it. Alternate translation: “Someone is calling out in the wilderness and saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:4	l177		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Everything from this phrase through to the end of [3:6](../03/06.md) is a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting from the book of Isaiah, and Isaiah is quoting the words of the person calling out in the wilderness. It would be best to indicate that by punctuating this material as a second-level quotation, since Luke is quoting from Scripture. However, if your language does not put one direct quotation within another, you can translate this material as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:4	rzv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. They are both telling people to make a good road for the Lord to travel on. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be helpful to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with another phrase that would show the relationship between them. Alternate translation: “Prepare a good road for the Lord to travel on, and do this by making sure that it follows a straight path” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
3:4	h9xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	This is a figurative way of telling people to get ready to listen to the Lord’s message when it comes. They are to do this by giving up their sins. Alternate translation: “Give up your sins so that you will be ready to listen to the Lord’s message when it comes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	wk8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται, καὶ πᾶν ὄρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται	1	This is a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road that began in the previous verse. When people prepare the road for an important person who is coming, they make sure that the road is level by taking material from high places and using it to fill in low places. However, this is also a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. It is a statement similar to the one Mary makes in [1:52](../01/52.md), “He has thrown down rulers from their thrones and he has raised up the lowly.” Metaphors in Scripture can have more than one reference like this. So we recommend that you translate the words directly and not provide a non-figurative explanation, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meanings of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	e52x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πᾶσα φάραγξ πληρωθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Since people would be doing this action in one sense of the metaphor, but God would be doing the action in another sense of the metaphor, it might be best not to be specific about who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Someone will fill in every valley” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:5	s66m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ πᾶν ὄρος καὶ βουνὸς ταπεινωθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, following the same principle as for the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “and someone will make every mountain and hill low” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:5	l178		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔσται τὰ σκολιὰ εἰς εὐθείαν, καὶ αἱ τραχεῖαι εἰς ὁδοὺς λείας	1	This too is both a continuation of the figurative description of making a good road and a description of the effects that the coming of the Lord will have on people. Something that is **crooked** becoming **straight** and something that is **rough** becoming **smooth** can be seen as metaphors for repentance and a change in a person’s way of life. And so we recommend once again that you translate the words directly and not provide a non-figurative explanation in the text of your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:6	l179		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πᾶσα σὰρξ	1	Luke is describing people figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the flesh they are made of. Alternate translation: “all people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:6	l180		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὄψεται	1	The term **see** is a figurative way of referring to recognition and understanding. Alternate translation: “will recognize” or “will understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:6	du1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὄψεται & τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **salvation** with a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “will understand how God saves people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:6	l181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	After this phrase, Isaiah ends his quotation from the person who is calling out in the wilderness. If you decided in [3:4](../03/04.md) to mark these words as a second-level quotation, indicate the end of that quotation here with whatever convention your language uses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
3:6	l182		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	τὸ σωτήριον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	After this phrase, Luke also ends his quotation from the book of Isaiah. If you decided in [3:4](../03/04.md) to mark this as a first-level quotation, indicate that ending here with whatever punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a first-level quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
3:7	sxn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βαπτισθῆναι ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for him to baptize them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:7	b724		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	The expression **offspring of** is an idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. John is using dangerous poisonous snakes to represent evil. Alternate translation: “You evil people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:7	l183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	γεννήματα ἐχιδνῶν	1	If your readers would not recognize the name **vipers**, which refers to dangerous poisonous snakes, you could state something more general. Alternate translation: “You are evil, like poisonous snakes” or “You are evil, like poisonous animals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
3:7	mcq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς?	1	John is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the people in the crowds to tell him who warned them. Instead, he is using the question form to challenge the people to think about what they believe baptism will do for them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “you could not escape from God’s wrath just by being baptized!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:7	g7tw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς	1	John is using the word **wrath** to refer figuratively to God’s punishment. This is by association with the way that punishment is an expression of God’s **wrath** or displeasure over sin. Alternate translation: “from the punishment that God is sending” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:8	pz16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποιήσατε & καρποὺς ἀξίους τῆς μετανοίας	1	John is figuratively comparing a person’s behavior to fruit. Just as a plant is expected to produce fruit that is appropriate for that kind of plant, a person who says that he has repented is expected to live righteously.

3:16	c1an		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς ὑμᾶς βαπτίσει & πυρί	1	The word **fire** is intended figuratively, and it suggests a fuller metaphor.

Alternate translation: “because John had rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother’s former wife” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:19	cu4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλεγχόμενος ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ περὶ Ἡρῳδιάδος, τῆς γυναικὸς τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that Herod’s brother was still alive. That made this marriage a violation of the law of Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because John had rebuked him for marrying Herodias, his brother’s former wife, while his brother was still alive. That was something which the law of Moses forbade” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:20	p2xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	κατέκλεισεν τὸν Ἰωάννην ἐν φυλακῇ	1	Herod did not do this by himself, Rather, as a ruler, he probably ordered his soldiers to lock John up.

3:21	phe6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

3:21	l200		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἅπαντα τὸν λαὸν	1	The phrase **all the people** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “all the people who came to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

3:22	q2yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	φωνὴν ἐξ οὐρανοῦ γενέσθαι	1	Luke speaks figuratively of this **voice** as if it were a living thing that could come from heaven to earth.

3:23	uvm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information about Jesus’ age and ancestors. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
3:23	d3sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτὸς ἦν Ἰησοῦς ἀρχόμενος ὡσεὶ ἐτῶν τριάκοντα	1	This idiomatic expression could mean: (1) the word **beginning** is a reference to Jesus starting his own ministry. UST follows this interpretation. Alternate translation: “Jesus himself was about 30 years old when he began his ministry” (2) Luke is saying that Jesus had just turned 30 was when he was baptized. Alternate translation: “Jesus himself was just 30 years old at this time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:23	z2xa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὢν υἱός, ὡς ἐνομίζετο, Ἰωσὴφ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

ULT does this with the poetry in 4:10-11 and 4:18-19, which is quoted from the Old Testamentt.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Jesus was tempted by the devil”\n\nWhile it is true that the devil actually believed that he could persuade Jesus to disobey God and obey him instead, it is important not to imply in your translation that Jesus would ever really have wanted to obey the devil.
4:1	n1xx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	Ἰησοῦς δὲ	1	Luke uses this expression to return to the story after providing background information about Jesus’ ancestors.

4:1	v18k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤγετο ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the Spirit led him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:2	bls8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	ἡμέρας τεσσεράκοντα πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	The Greek verb indicates that the temptation continued throughout the 40 days.

4:2	hg5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡμέρας τεσσεράκοντα πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form.

4:2	k47d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ οὐκ ἔφαγεν οὐδὲν	1	Make sure that it is clear in your translation that the word **he** refers to Jesus, not to the devil. Alternate translation: “Jesus did not eat anything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:3	bg52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶπεν & ὁ διάβολος	1	The devil either holds a stone in his hand or points to a nearby stone. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The devil picked up a stone and said” or “The devil pointed to a stone and said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:3	l202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ Υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, εἰπὲ τῷ λίθῳ τούτῳ, ἵνα γένηται ἄρτος	1	The devil is suggesting that this is a hypothetical condition, that the **stone** will only become **bread** if Jesus is the **Son of God**. The devil is speaking as if it is uncertain who Jesus is in order to challenge him to do this miracle to prove that he really is the **Son of God**. Alternate translation: “Prove that you are the Son of God by commanding this stone to become bread” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
4:3	y7yf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς & τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This is an important title for Jesus. Even the devil knew its significance. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
4:4	l203		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	This word introduces a contrast between the devil wanting Jesus to turn the stone into bread and Jesus refusing to do that. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
4:4	kde3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπεκρίθη πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς, γέγραπται	1	Jesus clearly implies in his answer that he is rejecting the devil’s challenge.

Alternate translation: “It is written that man will not live on bread alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:4	hr5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “The Scriptures say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:4	ek2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οὐκ ἐπ’ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	The word **bread** refers to food in general. Jesus quotes this scripture to explain why he will not turn the stone into bread. It means that food by itself, without God, is not enough to sustain a person in life. Alternate translation: “It is not just having food that makes a person truly alive” or “God says there are more important things than food” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:4	l205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Here, **man** has a generic sense that refers to all people. Alternate translation: “People” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
4:5	wm17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναγαγὼν αὐτὸν	1	The implication is that the devil brought Jesus **up** to a high place with a commanding view. Alternate translation: “the devil led Jesus up a mountain” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:5	jxi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἐν στιγμῇ χρόνου	1	In your language, it might seem that the phrase **an instant of time** expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “in an instant” or “in a short time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
4:6	l206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐμοὶ παραδέδοται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God has given me authority over all these kingdoms” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:6	dcx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐμοὶ παραδέδοται	1	The word **it** likely refers back to the singular antecedent **all this authority**, that is, the authority over these kingdoms. So the word you use to translate **it** should agree with **authority** in gender and number and in any other distinctions that your language marks. Alternate translation: “God has given me authority over all these kingdoms” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:7	g7h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐὰν προσκυνήσῃς ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ	1	The implication is that the devil wants visible, direct worship that will be an official act of submission.

4:7	l207			ἐνώπιον	1	Here, the term **before** means “in front of.”

4:8	v8ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the offer that the devil made. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
4:8	l208		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται, Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου προσκυνήσεις καὶ αὐτῷ μόνῳ λατρεύσεις	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “It is written that one must worship the Lord his God and serve only him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:8	m4tc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γέγραπται	1	Jesus clearly implies in his answer that he is rejecting the devil’s challenge.

4:8	bch3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου προσκυνήσεις καὶ αὐτῷ μόνῳ λατρεύσεις	1	Here, the Scriptures are using a statement to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must worship the Lord your God, and you must serve only him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
4:8	q8ni		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	προσκυνήσεις	1	Here, it may not be clear whether to use the singular or plural form of **you** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular form of **you**, if your language marks that distinction. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context. But they will address ambiguous cases such as this one. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
4:9	j8r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ πτερύγιον	1	The term **pinnacle** refers to the highest point or very top of something. If you have a similar term in your language, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:9	g2n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ Υἱὸς εἶ τοῦ Θεοῦ, βάλε σεαυτὸν ἐντεῦθεν κάτω	1	The devil is suggesting that this is a hypothetical condition, that Jesus will be able to jump safely from this great height if he really is the **Son of God**. The devil is speaking as if it is uncertain who Jesus is in order to challenge him to do this miracle to prove that he really is the **Son of God**. Alternate translation: “Prove that you are the Son of God by jumping safely from this great height” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
4:9	j9nx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς & τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This is an important title for Jesus. Even the devil knew its significance. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
4:9	i81s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βάλε σεαυτὸν ἐντεῦθεν κάτω	1	The exact location of the part of the temple that Luke describes is uncertain. However, the implication is that it was one of the places on the temple roof from which people would fall several hundred feet into the Kidron Valley if they jumped or slipped off. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this would ordinarily have been a deadly fall. Alternate translation: “jump from this great height” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:10	l209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται γὰρ, ὅτι τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ ἐντελεῖται περὶ σοῦ, τοῦ διαφυλάξαι σε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “For it is written that he will give orders to his angels regarding you, to protect you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:10	f5dn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γέγραπται γὰρ	1	The devil implies that his quote from the Psalms means that if Jesus really is the Son of God, he will not be hurt if he jumps from this great height.

4:10	nld8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῖς ἀγγέλοις αὐτοῦ ἐντελεῖται περὶ σοῦ, τοῦ διαφυλάξαι σε	1	**He** refers to God. Alternate translation: “God will order his angels to protect you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:11	l210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ, ὅτι ἐπὶ χειρῶν ἀροῦσίν σε, μήποτε προσκόψῃς πρὸς λίθον τὸν πόδα σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and that they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
4:11	l211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	μήποτε προσκόψῃς πρὸς λίθον τὸν πόδα σου	1	The Scriptures are figuratively using one way of being hurt to mean all ways of being hurt. Alternate translation: “so that you will not get hurt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

4:12	fy8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἴρηται	1	Jesus clearly implies in his answer that he is rejecting the devil’s challenge.

4:12	gf8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	οὐκ ἐκπειράσεις Κύριον τὸν Θεόν σου	1	The Scriptures are using a statement to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must not test the Lord your God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
4:13	nc2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συντελέσας πάντα πειρασμὸν	1	This does not imply that the devil was successful in his temptation. Jesus resisted every attempt. You can state this clearly. Alternate translation: “after the devil had repeatedly failed to persuade Jesus to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:13	qqd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄχρι καιροῦ	1	New Testament Greek had two words for time. The first referred to chronological time, that is, the passage of time. The second word referred to the right time to do something. ULT is using the phrase **an opportune time** to translate that second word. If your language makes this same distinction, use the corresponding word in your own translation. Alternate translation: “until the time was right to try again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:14	yfc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
4:14	ht5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ δυνάμει τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	This phrase means that God, by the Holy Spirit, was empowering Jesus in a special way, enabling him to do things that ordinary humans could not.

4:14	dhj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	φήμη ἐξῆλθεν & περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	Luke speaks figuratively of this **news** as if it were something that could **go out** actively by itself.

4:14	hah9			καθ’ ὅλης τῆς περιχώρου	1	Alternate translation: “everywhere around Galilee”

Alternate translation: “someone brought him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
4:17	l216		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπεδόθη αὐτῷ βιβλίον τοῦ προφήτου Ἠσαΐου	1	Since Jesus looked for a specific passage in the scroll, and since he said that it was being fulfilled right at that time, it is likely that Jesus requested this particular scroll. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at his request, someone brought him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:17	x52a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βιβλίον τοῦ προφήτου Ἠσαΐου	1	A **scroll** was a long, wide roll of special paper.

4:18	q96y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχρισέν με	1	In the Old Testament, ceremonial oil was poured on a person when they were given the authority to assume an office or do a special task. Isaiah uses anointing figuratively to indicate that God has appointed him to his work. Jesus applies these words to himself as well. Alternate translation: “he has appointed me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:18	l6ac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πτωχοῖς & τυφλοῖς	1	Luke is using the adjectives **poor** and **blind** as nouns in order to indicate groups of people.

4:18	a9wn			κηρύξαι αἰχμαλώτοις ἄφεσιν	1	Alternate translation: “to tell people who are being held captive that they can go free”

4:19	z262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κηρύξαι ἐνιαυτὸν Κυρίου δεκτόν	1	Luke is using the term **year** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “to announce that this is the time when the Lord will show his kindness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:20	sm11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πτύξας τὸ βιβλίον	1	A scroll was closed by rolling it like a tube to protect the writing inside it. Alternate translation: “closing the scroll by rolling it up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:20	ehx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ ὑπηρέτῃ	1	The **attendant** refers to a synagogue worker who, with proper care and reverence, would bring out and put away the scrolls that contained the Scriptures. If there is a word in your language for a person who has a similar role in your culture, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “the sexton” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
4:20	l217		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκάθισεν	1	Since a person would stand to read the Scriptures in a synagogue but then sit down to teach, the implication is that Jesus was going to speak to the people about what he had just read. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, as UST does. Alternate translation: “he sat down to teach” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:20	pu89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πάντων οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ ἐν τῇ συναγωγῇ	1	Luke is using one part of people, their **eyes**, figuratively to represent people themselves in the act of seeing. Alternate translation: “all the people in the synagogue” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
4:21	l218		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σήμερον	1	**Today** figuratively refers to the present moment. Alternate translation: “Right now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

4:22	l219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τοῖς λόγοις & τοῖς ἐκπορευομένοις ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	In your language, this phrase might seem like an unnecessarily elaborate way of speaking. If so, you could express the same idea more compactly. Alternate translation: “the … things he was saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
4:22	ty6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ υἱός ἐστιν Ἰωσὴφ οὗτος?	1	The people were making a statement, not asking a question. They did not expect others to verify for them who Jesus’ father was. Instead, they were using the question form to say how amazed they were. Joseph was not a religious leader, so they were surprised that his son would preach as well as he did. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “This is just Joseph’s son!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

5:intro	axr7				0	# Luke 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus calls Peter and his fellow fishermen to be his disciples (5:1-11)\n2. Jesus travels to various towns teaching and healing (5:12-26)\n3. Jesus calls Levi to be his disciple (5:27-32)\n4. Jesus teaches about fasting (5:33-39)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “You will catch men”\n\nPeter, James, and John were fishermen. When Jesus told them that they would catch men, he was using a metaphor to tell them he wanted them to help people believe the good news about him. See the last note to 5:10. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Sinners\n\nWhen the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses. But when Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who understand that they are sinners who have disobeyed God can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Fasting and feasting\n\nPeople would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or in order to show God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, such as during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Healthy and sick people\n\nTo correct the Pharisees, Jesus speaks of healthy people who do not need a doctor. This does not mean that there are people who do not need Jesus. Rather, Jesus was explaining why he spent time with people whom the Pharisees considered to be “sinners.” See the notes to 5:31-32. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Implicit information\n\nIn several parts of this chapter, as in other places in the book, Luke does not explain information that his original readers would already have understood. Modern readers might not know some of those things, so they might have trouble understanding all that Luke is communicating. The alternate translations in these notes and the readings in UST often illustrate how that information can be presented so that modern readers will be able to understand these passages. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Past events\n\nParts of this chapter are sequences of events that have already happened. In a given passage, Luke sometimes writes as if the events have already happened while other events are still in progress (even though they are complete at the time he writes). This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.
5:1	zc8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

5:7	n2fp			κατένευσαν τοῖς μετόχοις	1	The Greek text does not specify how they **signaled**, but since they were some distance from the shore, it may have been by waving their arms rather than by calling out. You can use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “they summoned their partners”
5:7	pr7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βυθίζεσθαι αὐτά	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the reason for this explicitly. Alternate translation: “they began to sink because the fish were so heavy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:8	r8j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	προσέπεσεν τοῖς γόνασιν Ἰησοῦ	1	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that Peter did not fall down accidentally.

5:8	j67m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνὴρ ἁμαρτωλός	1	Here, **man** means “adult male,” not the more general “human being.” So Peter is not saying generally, “I am a sinful person.” He really does mean, “I personally am a sinful man.” Be sure that this is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

5:12	i3zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πεσὼν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον	1	This phrase is an idiom that means that he bowed down.

5:12	ys5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	με καθαρίσαι	1	The man talks about becoming **clean** ceremonially, but it is implicit that he has become unclean because of his leprosy, so he is really asking Jesus to heal him of this disease. Alternate translation: “heal me from leprosy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:13	ziz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	καθαρίσθητι	1	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you from your leprosy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:13	l48a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ λέπρα ἀπῆλθεν ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Luke speaks figuratively of the man’s **leprosy** as if it were something that could actively go **away from him**. Alternate translation: “the man no longer had leprosy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
5:14	q18t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	αὐτὸς παρήγγειλεν αὐτῷ, μηδενὶ εἰπεῖν, ἀλλὰ ἀπελθὼν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate all of Jesus’ instructions as a direct quotation.

5:14	v1wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσένεγκε περὶ τοῦ καθαρισμοῦ σου καθὼς προσέταξεν Μωϋσῆς	1	Jesus assumes that the man will know that the law required a person who had been healed from a skin disease to make a specific sacrifice. This made the person ceremonially clean and they could participate once again in community religious activities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded so that you could become ceremonially clean once again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:14	jk14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	A priest would have to examine the man and certify that he had been healed before he would be allowed to offer this sacrifice.

5:15	q4t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to describe the news about Jesus that people spread by using words. Alternate translation: “the news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

5:16	l251			αὐτὸς & ἦν ὑποχωρῶν ἐν ταῖς ἐρήμοις καὶ προσευχόμενος	1	This expression **was withdrawing** indicates habitual action. Alternate translation: “he often withdrew to places where there were no other people so that he could pray”

5:18	l254		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

5:18	l9q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κλίνης	1	**A mat** was a portable bed that could also be used to transport a person. Alternate translation: “a stretcher” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

5:19	rkm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τὸν ὄχλον	1	The implication is that they could not enter because the crowd was so large that there was no room for them. Alternate translation: “because the crowd of people had filled the house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:19	s7bm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναβάντες ἐπὶ τὸ δῶμα	1	In this culture, houses had flat roofs, and many houses had a staircase outside that provided access to **the housetop**.

5:20	l83a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἰδὼν τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	The implication is that Jesus recognized that the friends of this paralyzed man strongly believed that he could heal him. Their actions proved that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When Jesus recognized that the man’s friends were convinced that he could heal him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:20	z4ek			ἄνθρωπε	1	**Man** was a general word that people used in this culture when speaking to a man whose name they did not know. If your language has a term that it uses for this same purpose, you could use it in your translation here. Alternate translation: “Friend”
5:20	c7r7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

5:21	l256		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οἱ γραμματεῖς	1	Here and elsewhere in the book, the term **the scribes** does not refer to people who make copies of documents.

5:21	l257		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	οἱ Φαρισαῖοι	1	**Pharisees** is the name of an important and powerful group of Jewish religious leaders in Jesus’ time. The name occurs many times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
5:21	ie5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διαλογίζεσθαι	1	These men were not debating or arguing out loud, since the next verse shows that this was rather something they were thinking.

5:21	l258		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	λέγοντες	1	Luke uses the word **saying** to introduce his quotation of what the religious leaders were thinking. If you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
5:21	a86c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ἐστιν οὗτος ὃς λαλεῖ βλασφημίας?	1	These religious leaders do not expect someone to tell them who Jesus is. Instead, they are using the question form to emphasize how inappropriate they think it is for Jesus to tell someone that he forgives their sins. As the next sentence explains, they think this means Jesus was claiming to be God, and so in their view, he would be speaking **blasphemies**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “This man is speaking blasphemies!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:21	s21n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας εἰ μὴ μόνος ὁ Θεός?	1	Once again the religious leaders are using a question form for emphasis, and you can translate their words as a statement or exclamation.

5:22	z4k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς & τοὺς διαλογισμοὺς αὐτῶν	1	This phrase indicates that they were reasoning silently, so the implication is that Jesus sensed what they were thinking. Alternate translation: “sensing what they were thinking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:22	l259		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the religious leaders were thinking. Alternate translation: “responded to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
5:22	et8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus does not expect the religious leaders to explain why they are thinking these things. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that they should not be thinking them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be thinking these things!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:22	p2hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	The term **hearts** figuratively represents the thoughts of these people. Alternate translation: “are you thinking these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:23	zid2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν, ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Jesus is using the form of a question in order to teach. He wants to make the scribes and Pharisees reflect on the situation and realize something. There are many implications. For example, these religious leaders may take the question in the sense, “Which is easier to get away with saying?” The answer would be, “Your sins are forgiven,” because people don’t expect visual proof of that, whereas if someone says, “Get up and walk,” and nothing happens, that proves the speaker doesn’t have the power to heal. Jesus likely intends the question in a different sense: “Which is the easier way to deal with a situation like this?” It appears that the man’s sickness has something to do with his sins, because Jesus forgives them. In such a situation, it would not be sufficient to say, “Get up and walk,” since that would address the effect but not the cause. To say, “Your sins are forgiven,” would deal with both the cause and the effect, so that would be the easier way to deal with the situation. There are many other implications that could also be drawn out as well—too many to include in the text of a translation. Since the question form is intrinsic to Jesus’ teaching method, you may wish simply to retain it in your translation. However, to show that he is teaching, not asking for information, you could introduce his question with a phrase that indicates its purpose. Alternate translation: “Think about this. Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk'?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:23	l260		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν, ἀφέωνταί σοι αἱ ἁμαρτίαι σου, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ περιπάτει?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Is it easier to tell someone that his sins are forgiven, or to tell him to get up and walk?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
5:24	f1lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὅτι ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐξουσίαν ἔχει	1	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “that I, the Son of Man, have authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
5:24	l261		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses it to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. Alternate translation: “that the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:24	l262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἔγειρε	1	As in [5:13](../05/13.md), this was not a command that the man was able to obey. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you, so you can get up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:25	agg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ παραχρῆμα ἀναστὰς	1	The implication is that the man was able to get up because Jesus had healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And all at once the man was healed, so he got up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:25	l263			ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν	1	Here, the term **before** means “in front of.” Alternate translation: “in front of everyone” or “where everyone could see him”
5:26	l264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἔκστασις ἔλαβεν ἅπαντας	1	Luke describes the **amazement** of the crowd figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of the people. Alternate translation: “they were all completely amazed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
5:26	f6tp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπλήσθησαν φόβου λέγοντες	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “fear filled them and they said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:26	l265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐπλήσθησαν φόβου	1	Luke describes the **fear** of the crowd figuratively as if it were something that could actively fill the people. Alternate translation: “they became very afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
5:27	k6r2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event. The expression **these things** refers to what the previous verses describe. Alternate translation: “After that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
5:27	abc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐξῆλθεν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus left that house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:27	xf15			ἐθεάσατο τελώνην	1	The Greek word that Luke uses for **saw** indicates that Jesus gave careful attention to this man when he saw him. Alternate translation: “observed a tax collector” or “looked carefully at a tax collector”
5:27	l266		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	In this context, to **follow** someone means to become that person’s disciple. Alternate translation: “Become my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:27	b3tr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	**Follow me** is not a command, but an invitation. Jesus is encouraging Levi to do this if he wants. Alternate translation: “I want you to become my disciple” or “I invite you to come and follow me as your teacher” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:28	phw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	καταλιπὼν πάντα	1	Here, **everything** is a generalization that refers to Levi’s position as a tax collector and the advantages that came with it.

5:29	g6yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Levi, not to Jesus. Alternate translation: “in his own house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:29	ip2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κατακείμενοι	1	In this culture, the manner of eating at a feast was to lie on a couch and prop oneself up with the left arm on some pillows. Alternate translation: “lying on banqueting couches” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
5:30	n82u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς αὐτοῦ	1	In this case, the pronoun **his** refers to Jesus, not to Levi. Alternate translation: “to Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:30	tmm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	διὰ τί μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε?	1	The Pharisees and scribes are using the question form to express their disapproval. They believed that religious people should separate themselves from people whom they considered to be sinners. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not eat and drink with sinful tax collectors!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:30	pi2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε	1	The word **you** is plural, since the Pharisees are speaking to the disciples as a group, not to one particular disciple. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
5:30	l268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἐσθίετε καὶ πίνετε	1	The Pharisees are figuratively using the two components of a meal to mean an entire meal. Alternate translation: “share meals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
5:30	ze7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	The Pharisees may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The previous verse says that there were many **tax collectors** at this banquet. So the term **sinners** may tell what the Pharisees thought these **tax collectors** were. Alternate translation: “with sinful tax collectors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
5:31	l269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the religious leaders were complaining about. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
5:31	t6iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ὑγιαίνοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλὰ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	Jesus begins his response by quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you could translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “People who are well do not need to see a doctor; people who are sick do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
5:31	i9gn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	The proverb expresses the idea compactly, and so it leaves out some words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply those words. Alternate translation: “rather, it is people who are sick who need a doctor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:32	g993		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	δικαίους	1	Luke is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “righteous people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:32	l270		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλοὺς εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	Once again Jesus expresses the idea compactly and leaves out some words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply those words. Alternate translation: “rather, I came to call sinners to repentance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:32	l271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μετάνοιαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **repentance** with a verb. Alternate translation: “to repent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:33	f6g6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ δὲ εἶπαν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the Pharisees and scribes. Alternate translation: “Then the religious leaders said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
5:33	l272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωάννου	1	The Pharisees and scribes assume that Jesus will know that they are referring to **John** the Baptist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:33	l273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ δὲ σοὶ ἐσθίουσιν καὶ πίνουσιν	1	There is an implied challenge and question in this observation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “But your disciples do not fast, and we want you to tell us why” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:33	l274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ἐσθίουσιν καὶ πίνουσιν	1	The Pharisees are figuratively using the two components of a meal to mean an entire meal. Alternate translation: “continue to have meals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
5:34	l275		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ δύνασθε τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν ποιῆσαι νηστεύειν?	1	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **are you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Can you actually make the groom’s party at a wedding fast while the groom is still with them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
5:34	hxe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ δύνασθε τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν ποιῆσαι νηστεύειν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants the scribes and Pharisees to reflect on the actions of his disciples in light of a situation they are already familiar with. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one tells the groom’s party at a wedding to fast while the groom is still with them!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
5:34	q9k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τοὺς υἱοὺς τοῦ νυμφῶνος	1	The expression **sons of** is a Hebrew idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of being an integral part of a wedding. These are the male friends who attend the groom during the ceremony and the festivities. Alternate translation: “the groom’s party” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:35	z8ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐλεύσονται δὲ ἡμέραι καὶ	1	Here Jesus is using **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “But there will certainly be a time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:35	he9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος	1	Jesus is speaking of himself figuratively as the **bridegroom**, and of his disciples as the groom’s party. He does not explain the metaphor, so you do not need to explain it in your translation unless you think your readers will not understand it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:35	l276		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπαρθῇ ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ὁ νυμφίος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “someone will take the bridegroom away from them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:35	l277		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Jesus is again using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:36	a4zs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἔλεγεν δὲ καὶ παραβολὴν πρὸς αὐτοὺς	1	Jesus gives a brief illustration that teaches something true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Alternate translation: “Then he gave them this illustration to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
5:36	qz5e			ἐπιβάλλει ἐπὶ ἱμάτιον παλαιόν	1	Alternate translation: “uses it to patch an old garment”
5:36	xj2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή γε	1	Jesus uses this expression to introduce a hypothetical situation that explains the reason why a person would not actually mend a garment in that way. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone did do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
5:37	n35t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀσκοὺς	1	These were bags made out of animal skins. They were used for holding wine. If your readers would not be familiar with **wineskins**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “leather bags” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
5:37	l278		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ δὲ μή γε	1	Jesus uses this expression once again to introduce a hypothetical situation that explains the reason why a person would not put new wine in an old wineskin. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone did do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
5:37	ac7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ῥήξει ὁ οἶνος ὁ νέος τοὺς ἀσκούς	1	When the new wine fermented and expanded, it would break the old skins because they could no longer stretch. Jesus’ audience would have understood this information about wine fermenting and expanding and about old leather losing its suppleness. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the new wine would burst the old wineskins because they would no longer be able to expand when the wine fermented” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:37	dw18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς ἐκχυθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the wine would spill out of the bags” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:37	l279		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ ἀσκοὶ ἀπολοῦνται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the leather bags would tear and become useless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:38	ijm3			ἀσκοὺς καινοὺς	1	See how you translated the term **wineskins** in [5:37](../05/37.md). Alternate translation: “fresh leather bags”
5:39	l280		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐδεὶς πιὼν παλαιὸν θέλει νέον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words. You may want to supply these words in your translation if not having them would be confusing in your language. Alternate translation: “No one who is used to drinking old wine wants to try new wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:39	pvn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς πιὼν παλαιὸν θέλει νέον	1	Jesus is figuratively contrasting the old teaching of the religious leaders with his own new teaching. The point is that people who are used to the old teaching are not receptive to the new things that he is bringing. Jesus does not explain the metaphor, so you do not need to explain it in your translation unless you think your readers will not understand it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:intro	vv2y				0	# Luke 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches about the Sabbath (6:1-11)\n2. Jesus chooses twelve apostles (6:12-16)\n3. Jesus teaches about being his disciple (6:17-49)\n\nThe long teaching in Luke 6:20-49 begins with blessings and woes that are similar to the beginning of the long teaching in Matthew 5-7. That part of Matthew has traditionally been called the “Sermon on the Mount.” The teaching here in Luke has many other similarities with the one in Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Eating the grain”\n\nWhen the disciples plucked and ate the grain in a field they were walking through on the Sabbath (Luke 6:1), the Pharisees said that they were breaking the law of Moses. The Pharisees said this because they thought that the disciples were doing work by picking the grain, and so they were disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees did not think the disciples were stealing. That is because the law of Moses told farmers to allow travelers to pluck and eat small amounts of grain from plants in fields that they traveled through or near. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### The twelve disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the twelve disciples:\n\nIn Matthew:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Mark:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn Luke:\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThe man whom Luke calls Judas the son of James is probably the same man whom Matthew and Mark call Thaddaeus. However, you do not need to explain that in your translation or give both names. You can translate Luke’s list as he wrote it, and allow Bible teachers to explain the reason for the difference.
6:1	c4sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
6:1	x5zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σπορίμων	1	These were large sections of land where people had scattered wheat seed in order to grow more wheat. Wheat is a kind of **grain** plant, and **grain** is a type of large grass that has edible seeds. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of plant, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “the areas where people were growing plants with edible seeds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:1	rl46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	στάχυας	1	The **heads** are the topmost part of the **grain** plant. They hold the mature, edible seeds. Alternate translation: “parts that held the seeds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:1	h9fy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ψώχοντες ταῖς χερσίν	1	The implication is that they did this to separate out the grain seeds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “rubbing them in their hands to separate the seeds from the other parts of the plant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:2	z32z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ποιεῖτε ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν τοῖς Σάββασιν?	1	The Pharisees are using the question form to make an accusation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are doing something that the law does not permit you to do on the Sabbath!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:2	m76z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ποιεῖτε ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν τοῖς Σάββασιν?	1	The Pharisees considered even the small action of plucking and rubbing heads of grain to be harvesting, and therefore work. You could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are harvesting grain, and that is work that the law does not permit you to do on the Sabbath!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:2	dum1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	τί ποιεῖτε	1	Here, **you** is plural. It refers to the disciples. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
6:3	l281		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the objection that the Pharisees raised.

6:3	vih6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐδὲ τοῦτο ἀνέγνωτε, ὃ ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ ὅτε ἐπείνασεν αὐτὸς, καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ ὄντες	1	Jesus does not expect the Pharisees to tell him whether they have read this passage in the Scriptures. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that the Pharisees should have learned a principle from that passage that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The Scriptures suggest otherwise, in the passage that tells what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:4	l282			ὡς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If you made the first part of the quotation in [6:3](../06/03.md) a separate sentence, begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He entered into the house of God”
6:4	l283		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus is figuratively describing the tabernacle as the **house of God**. He is speaking as if it were the place where God lived, since God’s presence was there. Alternate translation: “the tabernacle” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:4	yyh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως	1	The phrase **the bread of the presence** refers to loaves of bread that were placed on a table in the temple as an offering to God. They represented how the people of Israel lived in the **presence** of God. Alternate translation: “the bread that was offered to God” or “the bread that showed God lived among the people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:4	l284			οὓς οὐκ ἔξεστιν φαγεῖν, εἰ μὴ μόνους τοὺς ἱερεῖς	1	It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The law says that only the priests can eat that bread”
6:5	h453		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐστιν & ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Jesus is speaking of himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah, am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
6:5	l285		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐστιν & ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah, am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:5	xy9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Κύριός ἐστιν τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	The title **Lord** figuratively describes Jesus’ authority over the Sabbath. Alternate translation: “has authority over the Sabbath” or, if you translated in the first person, “have authority over the Sabbath” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:6	p1ee		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
6:6	d44q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἦν ἄνθρωπος ἐκεῖ	1	This expression introduces a new character into the story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
6:6	t77y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ ἡ δεξιὰ ἦν ξηρά	1	This means that the man’s **hand** was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out. It was probably bent almost into a fist, making it look smaller. Alternate translation: “his right hand was shriveled” or “his right hand was atrophied” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:7	q3sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παρετηροῦντο & αὐτὸν	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus, not to the man with the withered hand. Alternate translation: “were watching Jesus carefully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
6:7	c1qe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἵνα εὕρωσιν κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ	1	Luke is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Alternate translation: “because they wanted to find something that they could accuse him of” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
6:8	d7zu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	στῆθι εἰς τὸ μέσον	1	The implication is that Jesus wanted this man to stand where everyone could see him. Alternate translation: “stand here where everyone can see you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:9	j8y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πρὸς αὐτούς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the scribes and Pharisees. Alternate translation: “to the scribes and Pharisees” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

The intent of the question is therefore rhetorical. Jesus is not trying to obtain information; he wants someone to admit that something is true. However, Jesus says, “I ask you,” so this question is not like other rhetorical questions that might appropriately be translated as statements. This one should be translated as a question. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:9	dc6f			ἀγαθοποιῆσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι	1	Alternate translation: “to help someone or to harm someone”
6:10	abcb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	περιβλεψάμενος πάντας αὐτοὺς, εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, and **him** refers to the man with the withered hand. Alternate translation: “Jesus looked around at them all and said to the man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
6:10	x77k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἔκτεινον τὴν χεῖρά σου	1	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you, so you can stretch out your hand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
6:10	hce1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀποκατεστάθη ἡ χεὶρ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “his hand became healthy again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:11	l286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτοὶ & ἐπλήσθησαν ἀνοίας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “they became furious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:11	l287		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	αὐτοὶ & ἐπλήσθησαν ἀνοίας	1	Luke speaks figuratively of the **rage** of the scribes and Pharisees as if it were something that could actively fill them. Alternate translation: “they became furious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
6:11	l288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ἂν ποιήσαιεν τῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	The implication is that these religious leaders perceived Jesus as a threat and they wanted to get rid of him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:12	e4s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
6:12	gzn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Here Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
6:12	l289			ἐξελθεῖν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ὄρος	1	While the term **mountain** is definite here, it does not seem to refer to a specific, identifiable mountain. Rather, as many languages do, here the Greek is using a definite expression in a general sense. Alternate translation: “Jesus went up a mountain” or “Jesus climbed a high hill”
6:12	l7by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξελθεῖν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ ὄρος	1	The implication is that Jesus did this so that he could be alone and pray about whom to choose as his disciples. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus went up a mountain where he could be alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

6:13	zgh6			οὓς καὶ ἀποστόλους ὠνόμασεν	1	The term **apostles** comes from a Greek word that originally meant “messengers” or “delegates.” It took on a specialized meaning within the community of Jesus’ followers to mean the 12 men whom Jesus chose to be his authoritative representatives. Many languages have borrowed the Greek word to use in this sense. But if your language has developed its own special term for this role, use it in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he appointed them to be apostles”
6:14	l290		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σίμωνα & Πέτρον & Ἀνδρέαν & Ἰάκωβον & Ἰωάννην & Φίλιππον & Βαρθολομαῖον	1	These are seven men’s names. (The second name is a nickname for the first man.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
6:14	zdq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Ἀνδρέαν τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Simon. Alternate translation: “Simon’s brother, Andrew” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

6:27	pz5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἀγαπᾶτε τοὺς ἐχθροὺς ὑμῶν, καλῶς ποιεῖτε τοῖς μισοῦσιν ὑμᾶς	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus is using repetition to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers.

6:29	l308		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σε & σου	1	Even though Jesus is still speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is now addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
6:29	d5qi			ἐπὶ τὴν σιαγόνα	1	Alternate translation: “on one side of your face”
6:29	eq83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάρεχε καὶ τὴν ἄλλην	1	It may be helpful to state the implicit purpose of this action.

6:30	ts8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἀπὸ τοῦ αἴροντος τὰ σὰ, μὴ ἀπαίτει	1	Jesus is using another hypothetical situation to teach. Alternate translation: “suppose someone takes away something that is yours. Then do not demand that he give it back” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

6:31	l312		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	Jesus now returns to speaking to his disciples and the crowd about general situations, so **you** is plural here and in the following verses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
6:32	qh81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	Here Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. He wants to make a point and get his listeners to reflect on it.

6:33	l313		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	Once again Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. You could translate his words as a statement here as well.

6:34	l314		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ποία ὑμῖν χάρις ἐστίν?	1	Jesus is using the question form once again as a teaching tool. You could also translate his words as a statement here.

6:34	kgc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἵνα ἀπολάβωσιν τὰ ἴσα	1	Here the adjective **same** functions as a noun. It is plural, and ULT supplies the noun **things** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. The adjective is also neuter, and this is a use of the neuter plural in Greek to refer to a single thing in order to describe it in its entirety. Alternate translation: “expecting that everything they lend will be repaid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
6:35	s8j7			μηδὲν ἀπελπίζοντες	1	Alternate translation: “without expecting the person to pay you back”

6:35	zw5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	This is a figurative expression. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **sons** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human son or child. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:35	l316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	Jesus is using the word **sons** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “children of the Most High” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
6:35	qr5x			υἱοὶ Ὑψίστου	1	Make sure that the word **sons** or “children” in your translation is plural and not capitalized, if your language uses that convention for titles, so that readers do not confuse this expression with the title for Jesus, “the Son of the Most High,” which occurs in [1:32](../01/32.md) and [8:28](../08/28.md).
6:35	l317		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Ὑψίστου	1	See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “of the Most High God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

6:36	n28w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the **Father** of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: “God your Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

He could mean either God or other people. The word **they** is indefinite, so it does not necessarily refer to people rather than to God. You could represent this metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, God will give you a generous amount” or “Like a generous grain merchant who presses down the grain and shakes it together and pours in so much that it fills a container and spills over, people will give you a generous amount” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:38	l320		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πεπιεσμένον σεσαλευμένον ὑπερεκχυννόμενον, δώσουσιν εἰς τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	These are all passive verb forms in Greek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate them with active verbal phrases. See the alternate translation in the previous note. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:38	l321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸν κόλπον ὑμῶν	1	This is a reference to the way people in this culture would form a pocket or carrying pouch from the folds of the front of their robes. If you readers would not be familiar with this practice, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the folds of your robe” or “a container” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:38	fp26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ᾧ & μέτρῳ μετρεῖτε, ἀντιμετρηθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Jesus does not say exactly who will measure. This could mean: (1) “God will give to you in just as generous or stingy a way as you give to others.” (2) “people will give to you in just as generous or stingy a way as you give to others.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:39	bw7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	εἶπεν δὲ καὶ παραβολὴν αὐτοῖς	1	Jesus is giving a brief illustration that teaches something true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Alternate translation: “Then he gave them this illustration to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
6:39	l322		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	Here the word translated **blind man** is masculine, but Jesus is using it in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “Can one person who is blind guide another person who is blind?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
6:39	l323		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **is he?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Can one person who is blind really guide another person who is blind?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
6:39	kyt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μήτι δύναται τυφλὸς τυφλὸν ὁδηγεῖν?	1	Jesus is not expecting the people in the crowd to tell him whether one **blind** person can guide another. He is using the question form as a teaching tool to make a point and get his listeners to reflect on it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “We all know that one blind person cannot guide another blind person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:39	nm4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τυφλὸς	1	The **blind** person figuratively represents someone who has not yet been fully trained and taught as a disciple. But since Jesus explains this figure in the next three verses, you do not need to explain it explicitly here in your own translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:39	f4xj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἀμφότεροι εἰς βόθυνον ἐμπεσοῦνται?	1	Jesus is using this question as well as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Both of them would certainly fall into a ditch” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:40	ipr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἔστιν μαθητὴς ὑπὲρ τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	The word **above** creates a spatial metaphor. Alternate translation: “A disciple is not better than his teacher” or “A disciple is not greater than his teacher” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:40	l324		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔστιν μαθητὴς ὑπὲρ τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what this implicitly means. Alternate translation: “A disciple does not know more than his teacher” or “A disciple is not wiser than his teacher” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:40	a6ym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κατηρτισμένος & πᾶς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “every disciple whose teacher has fully taught him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:41	l7vj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί & βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, τὴν δὲ δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ οὐ κατανοεῖς?	1	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “do not look at the speck in your brother’s eye while ignoring the log in your own eye” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:41	jpt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τί & βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “you should not criticize the less important faults of a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:41	l325		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	βλέπεις & σου & τῷ ἰδίῳ & οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	Even though Jesus is still speaking to his disciples and the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation here, so **you** and **your** are singular in this verse. But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
6:41	j1r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ κάρφος	1	If your readers would not be familiar with **wood**, in your translation you could use a phrase that describes the smallest thing that commonly falls into a person’s eyes in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the grain of sand” or “the tiny object” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:41	ud6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	The term **brother** figuratively refers to a fellow believer in Jesus. Alternate translation: “of a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:41	l326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ	1	This fellow believer could be either a man or a woman, so be sure that this is clear in your translation, for example, by using both the masculine and feminine forms of the word for “believer.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
6:41	ssu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν δὲ δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “while ignoring your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:41	l327		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὴν & δοκὸν τὴν ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ ὀφθαλμῷ	1	A log could not literally go into a person’s eye. Jesus is exaggerating to emphasize his point and make it memorable. Alternate translation: “your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
6:41	h9a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	δοκὸν	1	You could translate this with the term for the kind of long, large piece of **wood** that people in your culture would encounter. Or if your readers would not be familiar with **wood**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “beam” or “plank” or “large object” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:42	l345		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	πῶς δύνασαι λέγειν τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου	1	Jesus is speaking to his disciples and the crowd, but he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular here. (The terms **you**, **your**, and **yourself** are also singular throughout the rest of this verse, because either Jesus is addressing an individual situation, or one person is addressing another in fictional dialogue.) If the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
6:42	rkk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύνασαι λέγειν	1	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool, not to ask for information. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should not say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:42	l346		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ ἀδελφῷ σου, ἀδελφέ, ἄφες	1	The term **brother** figuratively means a fellow believer in Jesus. So in its first instance here, you could translate the term the way you did in [6:41](../06/41.md). But since it is realistic that in dialogue one believer might address another believer as **Brother** or “Sister,” you could retain the figurative term in its second instance. Alternate translation: “to a fellow believer, ‘Brother,’ or ‘Sister, let’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:42	l328		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἄφες ἐκβάλω τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σου	1	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “let me help you correct some of your faults” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:42	l329		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς τὴν ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ δοκὸν οὐ βλέπων	1	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “you yourself are not correcting your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:42	l330		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὴν ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ σοῦ δοκὸν	1	A log could not literally go into a person’s eye. Jesus is continuing to exaggerate to emphasize his point and make it memorable. Alternate translation: “your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
6:42	l331		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔκβαλε πρῶτον τὴν δοκὸν ἐκ τοῦ ὀφθαλμοῦ σοῦ	1	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “First recognize and correct your own serious faults” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:42	l332		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου ἐκβαλεῖν	1	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “to help a fellow believer correct his or her faults” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:43	ezb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Jesus uses the word **for** to introduce the reason for what he said in the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “This is because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
6:43	u159		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ γάρ ἐστιν δένδρον καλὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν σαπρόν; οὐδὲ πάλιν δένδρον σαπρὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλόν	1	Jesus is twice using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “For a healthy tree naturally produces good fruit and, on the other hand, an unhealthy tree naturally produces bad fruit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
6:43	pi3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ γάρ ἐστιν δένδρον καλὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν σαπρόν; οὐδὲ πάλιν δένδρον σαπρὸν ποιοῦν καρπὸν καλόν	1	This is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “For a person of good character naturally says and does helpful things but, on the other hand, a person of bad character naturally says and does harmful things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:44	z1vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἕκαστον & δένδρον ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου καρποῦ γινώσκεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who does the action. Alternate translation: “people recognize a tree by the fruit that it bears” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
6:44	l335		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕκαστον & δένδρον ἐκ τοῦ ἰδίου καρποῦ γινώσκεται	1	This phrase is a metaphor. Alternate translation: “each person’s words and actions reveal his or her character” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:44	l336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οὐ γὰρ ἐξ ἀκανθῶν συλλέγουσιν σῦκα, οὐδὲ ἐκ βάτου σταφυλὴν τρυγῶσιν	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis and to capture the interest of his listeners. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Instead, you could combine them into a single general expression. Alternate translation: “people do not collect the kind of fruit that grows on a tree or a vine from a small, thorny bush” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
6:44	ns81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀκανθῶν	1	The word **thornbush** refers to a kind of plant that has sharp protective spines on its stem. If your readers would not know what a **thornbush** is, in your translation you could use the name of another plant that does not produce edible fruit. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:44	ux87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βάτου	1	The term **briar bush** refers to a kind of plant that has thorny stems growing in dense clusters. If your readers would not know what a **briar bush** is, in your translation you could use the name of another plant that does not produce edible fruit. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:45	fd19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἀγαθὸς ἄνθρωπος	1	Here, the word **man** refers to any person, male or female. Alternate translation: “A righteous person” or “A moral person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
6:45	kz5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ θησαυροῦ τῆς καρδίας	1	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the good thoughts of a righteous person as if they were treasures stored deep inside that person. Alternate translation: “from the good things that he keeps deep inside himself” or “from the good things that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:45	i93l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῆς καρδίας	1	In this expression, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “that he keeps deep inside himself” or “that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:45	gpn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	προφέρει τὸ ἀγαθόν	1	Producing what is good, the way a tree would produce fruit, is a metaphor for doing what is good. Alternate translation: “does what is good” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:45	l337		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ	1	For rhetorical purposes, Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning can be inferred from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “from the evil treasure of his heart” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
6:45	y2cj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ πονηροῦ	1	Once the meaning is inferred, it is clear that Jesus is speaking figuratively of the evil thoughts of a wicked person as if they were treasures stored deep inside that person, and of the **heart** figuratively to represent the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “from the evil things that he keeps deep inside himself” or “from the evil things that he values deeply” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:45	l338		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκ & περισσεύματος καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	3	In this expression as well, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “what a person is thinking and feeling is expressed in what he says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
6:45	jc6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐκ & περισσεύματος καρδίας λαλεῖ τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	3	The phrase **his mouth** represents the person as a whole, in the action of speaking. Alternate translation: “what a person is thinking and feeling comes out in what he says” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
6:46	a4av			τί δέ με καλεῖτε Κύριε, Κύριε, καὶ οὐ ποιεῖτε ἃ λέγω?	1	The repetition of these words indicates that these people regularly called Jesus **Lord**. Alternate translation: “And why are you always calling me ‘Lord’ when you do not do what I tell you?’”
6:47	wwu5			πᾶς ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρός με, καὶ ἀκούων μου τῶν λόγων καὶ ποιῶν αὐτούς, ὑποδείξω ὑμῖν τίνι ἐστὶν ὅμοιος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could move the last phrase to the beginning of the verse. Alternate translation: “I will tell you what every person is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice”
6:47	l339		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	μου τῶν λόγων	1	Jesus uses the term **words** figuratively to refer to the teachings he is giving by using words. Alternate translation: “my teachings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:47	i3tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὑποδείξω ὑμῖν τίνι ἐστὶν ὅμοιος	1	Jesus says this to introduce the simile in the next verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
6:48	l340		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπῳ οἰκοδομοῦντι οἰκίαν	1	Here Jesus is using **man** in the generic sense. Alternate translation: “a person building a house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
6:48	cw41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἔσκαψεν καὶ ἐβάθυνεν καὶ ἔθηκεν θεμέλιον ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν	1	The **foundation** is the part of a **house** that connects it to the ground. People in Jesus’ time dug down into the ground until they reached a layer of solid **rock**, and then they began to build **on the rock**. You could describe this more fully in your translation. Alternatively, if the people of your culture would not be familiar with laying the **foundation** of a **house** on bedrock, you could instead describe how they would ensure that a dwelling was safe and stable. Alternate translation: “dug down deep enough to reach a layer of solid rock and set the foundation of the house on it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:48	l341		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἔσκαψεν καὶ ἐβάθυνεν	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The expression **dug deep** tells what goal the person had when he or she **dug down**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “dug down deep enough” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
6:48	dp2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν πέτραν	1	This means the layer of hard **rock** that lies deep under the soil. Alternate translation: “bedrock” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:48	qc2z			ποταμὸς	1	Alternate translation: “floodwaters”
6:48	d3gs			προσέρηξεν	1	Alternate translation: “crashed against”
6:48	h75u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἴσχυσεν σαλεῦσαι αὐτὴν	1	Jesus is figuratively describing what the waters would do at first to represent what they would ultimately do if they could. This meaning is clear from what he says in the next verse. Alternate translation: “it could not destroy it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:48	tu5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διὰ τὸ καλῶς οἰκοδομῆσθαι αὐτήν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

6:49	sjf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Jesus uses this word to draw a strong contrast to the previous person who built with a foundation. Alternate translation: “However” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
6:49	l347		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὁ & ἀκούσας καὶ μὴ ποιήσας	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from [6:47](../06/47.md). Alternate translation: “anyone who hears my teachings but does not put them into practice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
6:49	wg4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὅμοιός ἐστιν	1	Jesus says this to introduce the simile that follows in the rest of the verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
6:49	l342		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπῳ οἰκοδομήσαντι οἰκίαν	1	Here Jesus is using **man** in the generic sense. Alternate translation: “a person who built a house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
6:49	yu5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν χωρὶς θεμελίου	1	The phrase **on the ground without a foundation** refers to the same method of building as in [6:48](../06/48.md). You could describe this more fully in your translation. Alternatively, if the people of your culture would not be familiar with that building method, you could use the same image for creating a stable building that you used there in your translation. Alternate translation: “without digging down first to create a foundation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
6:49	bs8c			ᾗ προσέρρηξεν ὁ ποταμός	1	In this context, the word **flowed** indicates violent impact. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “The floodwaters crashed against it”
6:49	q98t			συνέπεσεν	1	Alternate translation: “it fell down” or “it came apart”
6:49	jm86			ἐγένετο τὸ ῥῆγμα τῆς οἰκίας ἐκείνης μέγα	1	Your language may require you to say what was responsible for the **ruin** of the **house**. Alternate translation: “the floodwaters completely demolished that house”
7:intro	u8gj				0	# Luke 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus does miracles in Capernaum and Nain (7:1-17)\n2. Jesus responds to messengers from John the Baptist and then teaches about John (7:18-35)\n3. A woman anoints Jesus with perfume (7:36-50)\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. ULT does this with the quoted material in 7:27.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Centurion\n\nA centurion was a Roman military commander. The centurion who asked Jesus to heal his slave (Luke 7:2) was doing some unusual things. A Roman soldier, especially an officer, would almost never go to a Jew for help, and most wealthy people did not love or care for their slaves. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/centurion]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### John’s Baptism\n\nThis chapter refers again to the baptism of John (7:29). John baptized people who wanted to show that they knew they were sinners and that they were sorry for their sin. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nIn 7:34, Jesus describes how the Pharisees said he was a friend of “sinners.” That was the name that the Pharisees used for people whom they thought were disobeying the law of Moses. In reality, it was the Pharisees who were sinful, since they rejected Jesus, the Savior whom God had sent. This situation can be understood as irony. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### Washing feet\n\nThe feet of the people in the ancient Near East were very dirty because they wore sandals and the roads and trails were dusty in the dry season and muddy in the wet season. Only slaves washed other people’s feet. The woman who washed Jesus’ feet was showing him great honor.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now he was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow, so he had been her only means of support” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “people spread these sayings about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

7:25	nn75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς βασιλείοις	1	**Palaces** are large, elaborate houses where kings or queens would live.

7:27	wt2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	God, speaking through the prophet Malachi, uses the term **behold** to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now pay attention” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

7:28	rr11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	The phrase **those born of women** is an idiom that refers to all people. Alternate translation: “of all the people who have ever lived” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:28	hfqf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	If you would like to retain the idiom but your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “among those whom women have borne” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:28	gfz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μείζων & Ἰωάννου οὐδείς ἐστιν	1	Here Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative term together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “John is the greatest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
7:28	c33u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ & μικρότερος	1	Jesus is using the adjective **least** as a noun in order to indicate a kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the least important person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
7:28	l379		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “whose life God is ruling” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:28	r81b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μείζων αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	The implication is that being part of the kingdom of God is greater than any human distinctive. So anyone who is part of God’s kingdom is greater than even John, whom Jesus said was the greatest person who had ever lived before the coming of the kingdom. Alternate translation: “is greater than John is because they are part of something greater than anything that is human” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:29	idv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐδικαίωσαν τὸν Θεόν, βαπτισθέντες τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they had come to John for baptism, declared God to be righteous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:29	m5cn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐδικαίωσαν τὸν Θεόν	1	The implication is that the people agreed that God had been right to send John to tell them to repent of their sins. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “agreed that God had been right to send John to tell them to repent of their sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:29	s9v6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βαπτισθέντες τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “because they had come to John for baptism” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:30	l380		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	νομικοὶ	1	Here and elsewhere in the book, the term **lawyers** does not mean people who would represent clients and argue cases in court or draw up legal documents. Rather, it refers to experts in the law of Moses and its application to various situations. Alternate translation: “experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:30	v8f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τὴν βουλὴν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἠθέτησαν εἰς ἑαυτούς, μὴ βαπτισθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because they had not come to John for baptism, rejected what God wanted them to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
7:30	wqc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μὴ βαπτισθέντες ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “because John had not baptized them” or “because they had not come to John for baptism” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:31	cs1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνι οὖν ὁμοιώσω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης, καὶ τίνι εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι?	1	Jesus is using these questions as a teaching tool, to introduce a comparison. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate them as statements. Alternate translation: “This is what I compare the people of this time to. This is what they are like” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:31	ix8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	τίνι οὖν ὁμοιώσω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης, καὶ τίνι εἰσὶν ὅμοιοι?	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis and to capture the interest of his listeners. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “What should I compare the people of this time to?” or “This is what I compare the people of this time to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
7:31	ec4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀνθρώπους τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “the people of this generation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
7:32	n8yp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὅμοιοί εἰσιν	1	These words are the beginning of Jesus’ comparison. His opponents complain about John being too austere, and they complain about him not being austere enough, just like children who complain when other children don’t dance with them, and then complain again when they don’t cry with them. Since Jesus explains this comparison in the next two verses, you do not need to explain it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
7:32	f7hg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀγορᾷ	1	This means a large, open-air area where people come to sell their goods. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:32	l381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ηὐλήσαμεν ὑμῖν	1	The children are referring to the **flute** to indicate that they played a happy, upbeat tune, for which the **flute** was well suited. Alternate translation: “We played a happy tune for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:32	xgg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	The children are expressing a contrast between what they expected their playmates to do and what those playmates actually did. Alternate translation: “but” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
7:32	m2k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	Once again the children are expressing a contrast between what they expected their playmates to do and what those playmates actually did. Alternate translation: “but” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
7:33	kbc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	μὴ ἐσθίων ἄρτον	1	This could mean one of two things. Either way, Jesus is using one kind of food, **bread**, figuratively to represent all kinds of food. (1) It could refer to the way that John lived on whatever he could find to eat in the desert. Alternate translation: “not eating regular food” (2) It could mean that John often went without eating as a devotional practice. Alternate translation: “frequently fasting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:33	wka1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, δαιμόνιον ἔχει	1	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what the Pharisees were saying about John. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that he has a demon” or “you accuse him of having a demon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:34	k33e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
7:34	l382		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). In this case the title highlights Jesus’ identification with humanity in the special role that God has given him. Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:34	s1um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ἰδοὺ, ἄνθρωπος φάγος καὶ οἰνοπότης, φίλος τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what the Pharisees were saying about him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that he eats and drinks too much and that he is a friend of tax collectors and sinners” or (if you used the first person for the title “Son of Man”) “you say that I eat and drink too much and that I am a friend of tax collectors and sinners” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
7:34	l383		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	**Behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Now this is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:34	am9s			ἄνθρωπος φάγος	1	Alternate translation: “a man who is a glutton” or “a man who eats too much”
7:34	chu4			ἄνθρωπος & οἰνοπότης	1	Alternate translation: “a man who is a drunkard” or “a man who drinks too much alcohol”
7:35	ba4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	This appears to be a proverb, a short popular saying of the culture, that Jesus applied to this situation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the saying is true that wisdom is justified by all her children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
7:35	l384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	This proverb likely uses a Hebrew idiom in which the “sons” or **children** of a thing share its qualities. Alternate translation: “wisdom is justified by people who are wise themselves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:35	l385		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν τέκνων αὐτῆς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “wise people recognize when someone else is following a wise course” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:36	fd2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἠρώτα δέ τις αὐτὸν τῶν Φαρισαίων, ἵνα φάγῃ μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	This phrase introduces a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
7:36	lhd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	τις & τῶν Φαρισαίων	1	This phrase also introduces the Pharisee into the story. In [7:40](../07/40.md), Jesus addresses him as Simon. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give his name here, as UST does. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee named Simon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
7:36	dy31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κατεκλίθη	1	See how you translated this phrase in [5:29](../05/29.md). It was the custom in this culture for dinner guests to eat while lying comfortably around the table on banqueting couches. Alternate translation: “he took his place at the table” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:37	l386		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:37	a9iu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	γυνὴ ἥτις ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was woman who lived in that city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
7:37	x4sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἁμαρτωλός	1	Luke is speaking from the perspective of the Pharisee when he says that the woman was a **sinner**. Since the Pharisee would likely not have known her personally, this is an implicit reference to her reputation. She may have been a prostitute, as UST suggests. Alternate translation: “who had a reputation for living a sinful life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:37	l387		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κομίσασα	1	In this culture, if people wanted to hear what someone’s special dinner guest had to say, they were allowed to come and stand around the walls of the banqueting hall and listen, even if they had not been invited to share in the meal. And so this woman was allowed to enter and listen to Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that specifically. Alternate translation: “she came into the banquet hall as a visitor, bringing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:37	apx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀλάβαστρον	1	The word **alabaster** is the name of a soft, white stone. People stored precious and valuable items in jars made from alabaster. Alternate translation: “a jar made of soft, white stone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:37	a954		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύρου	1	This oil had fragrant additives. To make a nice smell, people would rub the oil on themselves or sprinkle their clothing with it. Alternate translation: “that contained oil with perfume in it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
7:38	v5xh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ταῖς θριξὶν τῆς κεφαλῆς αὐτῆς	1	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “with her hair” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
7:38	i93v			ἤλειφεν τῷ μύρῳ	1	Alternate translation: “pouring perfume on them”
7:39	u455		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	εἶπεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ λέγων	1	As noted in [3:10](../03/10.md), Luke often uses the word **saying** to introduce a quotation. Particularly in cases like this one, if you indicate the quotation in some other way, such as with quotation marks, you do not need to represent this word in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
7:39	xc9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	οὗτος εἰ ἦν προφήτης, ἐγίνωσκεν ἂν τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνὴ, ἥτις ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν	1	This Pharisee is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He has concluded that Jesus must not be a prophet, because he allowed this sinful woman to touch him, and a prophet would have known she was sinful and not allowed that. Alternate translation: “Jesus must not be a prophet, because if he were, he would know that the woman who is touching him is a sinner” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
7:39	tbq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τίς καὶ ποταπὴ ἡ γυνὴ, ἥτις ἅπτεται αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἁμαρτωλός ἐστιν	1	Simon assumed that a prophet would never allow a sinner to touch him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state his assumption explicitly. Alternate translation: “that this woman is a sinner, and he would not allow her to touch him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:40	l388		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the Pharisee was thinking. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
7:40	u3cg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σίμων	1	This was the name of the Pharisee who invited Jesus into his home. This was not Simon Peter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
7:40	l389			ὁ δέ, Διδάσκαλε, εἰπέ, φησίν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “And he said, ‘Say it, Teacher!’”
7:40	l390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	Διδάσκαλε, εἰπέ	1	Simon is inviting Jesus to speak, not ordering him to speak. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate his words as more of an invitation. You could also translate them as a question, as UST does. Alternate translation: “Go ahead and say it.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
7:40	l391			Διδάσκαλε	1	This was a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
7:41	sv92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	δύο χρεοφιλέται ἦσαν: δανιστῇ τινι	1	To help Simon the Pharisee understand what he wants to teach him, Jesus tells him a story. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told him this story to help him understand. ‘There were two debtors’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
7:41	fcq6			δύο χρεοφιλέται ἦσαν: δανιστῇ τινι	1	Alternate translation: “Two different people owed money to the same moneylender”
7:41	snz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δηνάρια πεντακόσια	1	The word **denarii** is the plural of “denarius.” A denarius was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “500 silver coins” or “an amount equivalent to a year and a half’s wages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
7:41	i92j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ὁ δὲ ἕτερος πεντήκοντα	1	Alternate translation: “the other person owed 50 silver coins” or “the other person owed an amount equal to 50 days’ wages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
7:42	l392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	μὴ ἐχόντων αὐτῶν ἀποδοῦναι	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. He is not saying that the men no longer needed to repay these debts. Rather, he is saying that they did not have enough money to repay the lender what they owed him. Alternate translation: “When they were not able to repay their debts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:42	lbq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀμφοτέροις ἐχαρίσατο	1	This does not mean literally that the lender decided he would not hold their failure to repay against them. Rather, it is an idiom that means that he told them they did not have to repay the money. Alternate translation: “he canceled both of their debts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
7:43	l393		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς Σίμων εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Simon responded to the question that Jesus asked him. Alternate translation: “Simon responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
7:43	l394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὑπολαμβάνω ὅτι ᾧ τὸ πλεῖον ἐχαρίσατο	1	Simon leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “I suppose that the one to whom he forgave the most will love him the most” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:43	uyj6			ὑπολαμβάνω	1	Simon was cautious about his answer. Alternate translation: “Probably”

7:44	s7g6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	στραφεὶς πρὸς τὴν γυναῖκα	1	Jesus **turned to the woman** in order to direct Simon’s attention to her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus turned to the woman so that Simon would look at her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
7:44	l395		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτην τὴν γυναῖκα?	1	Jesus does not expect Simon to tell him whether he can **see** the **woman**. Rather, he is using the question as a teaching tool, to focus Simon’s attention on her as an example of showing love and gratitude. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to consider this woman.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:44	mw7d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὕδωρ μοι ἐπὶ πόδας οὐκ ἔδωκας	1	It was a basic responsibility of a host to provide **water** and a towel for guests to wash and dry their **feet** after walking on dusty roads. Alternate translation: “You did not provide me with anything to wash my feet, as a considerate host would have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:44	mw58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐκ ἔδωκας; αὕτη δὲ	1	In this verse and the next two verses, Jesus uses such phrases to contrast Simon’s lack of courtesy with the woman’s extreme actions of gratitude. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
7:44	am5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὕτη & τοῖς δάκρυσιν ἔβρεξέν μου τοὺς πόδας	1	The woman used **her tears** in place of the missing water. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “she has wet my feet with her tears in place of the water you did not provide” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:44	ld62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ταῖς θριξὶν αὐτῆς ἐξέμαξεν	1	The woman used **her hair** in place of the missing towel. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and she has dried my feet with her hair in place of the towel you did not provide” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:45	xj92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φίλημά μοι οὐκ ἔδωκας	1	It was customary in this culture for a host to greet a guest with a **kiss** on the cheek. Simon did not do this for Jesus. Alternate translation: “You did not greet me with a kiss on the cheek, as a welcoming host would have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:45	r2jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ διέλιπεν καταφιλοῦσά μου τοὺς πόδας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **stopped**. Alternate translation: “has continued to kiss my feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
7:45	u3er		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	οὐ διέλιπεν καταφιλοῦσά μου τοὺς πόδας	1	The woman kissed the **feet** of Jesus, rather than his cheek, as a sign of extreme repentance and humility. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has continued to kiss my feet to show her repentance and humility” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
7:46	j8wj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὐκ ἤλειψας; αὕτη δὲ	1	Jesus continues to contrast Simon’s poor hospitality with the actions of the woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
7:46	le9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλαίῳ τὴν κεφαλήν μου οὐκ ἤλειψας	1	It was the custom in this culture to welcome an honored guest by pouring refreshing olive **oil** on his **head**. Alternate translation: “You did not welcome me by pouring oil on my head” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:46	g6va		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἤλειψεν τοὺς πόδας μου	1	The woman greatly honored Jesus by doing this. She demonstrated humility and expressed her own sense of unworthiness by anointing his **feet** instead of his head. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has anointed my feet to show her humility” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
7:47	kwc5			λέγω σοι	1	This phrase emphasizes the importance of the statement that follows. Alternate translation: “pay attention to this”
7:47	clu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνται αἱ ἁμαρτίαι αὐτῆς αἱ πολλαί	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has forgiven her many sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:47	l396		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι ἠγάπησεν πολύ	1	The implication is that her display of love was the evidence that her sins were forgiven. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “We can tell this because she has shown that she greatly loves the one who forgave her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:47	jql4			ὅτι ἠγάπησεν πολύ	1	Your language may require you to state the object of **loved**. Alternate translation: “because she greatly loves the one who forgave her”
7:47	qd9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ᾧ δὲ ὀλίγον ἀφίεται, ὀλίγον ἀγαπᾷ	1	In this sentence Jesus states a general principle. However, he is saying implicitly that Simon specifically has shown very little love for him. A further implication is that **one to whom little is forgiven** is actually someone who thinks he is better than others and mistakenly thinks he does not need to be forgiven for very much. Alternate translation: “a person like you who thinks that God has only had to forgive him for a few things does not show much love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:47	l397		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ᾧ & ὀλίγον ἀφίεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “the person who thinks that God has only had to forgive him for a few things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:48	c7hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῇ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, not to Simon. The word **her** refers to the woman. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said to the woman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:48	lq5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφέωνταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “I have forgiven your sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:49	enw4			συνανακείμενοι	1	Alternate translation: “who were eating together with him”
7:49	ie4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς οὗτός ἐστιν ὃς καὶ ἁμαρτίας ἀφίησιν?	1	The religious leaders knew that only God could forgive sins. They did not believe that Jesus was God. So they are using the question form to make an accusation. Alternate translation: “This man is not God, so he cannot forgive sins!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:50	lje8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “trust.” Alternate translation: “you have trusted in God, and God has saved you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:50	l398		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of the woman’s **faith** as if it had actively **saved** her. He means that it provided the conditions for her to receive salvation from God. Alternate translation: “you have trusted in God, and God has saved you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:50	sp2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πορεύου εἰς εἰρήνην	1	This was a way of saying goodbye while giving a blessing at the same time. It also reassured the woman, despite the disapproval of the religious leaders. Alternate translation: “May God give you peace as you go” or “You may go now, and do not worry about your sins anymore” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:intro	ba3i				0	# Luke 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches the crowds with parables (8:1-21)\n2. Jesus calms a storm on the Sea of Galilee (8:22-25)\n3. Jesus drives out many demons from a man (8:26-39)\n4. Jesus heals a woman and restores a dead girl to life (8:40-55)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Miracles\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus makes a storm stop by speaking to it, he makes a dead girl alive by speaking to her, and he makes evil spirits leave a man by speaking to them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nParables were short stories that Jesus told so that people who wanted to believe in him could easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. But people who did not want to believe in him would not be able to understand the message (Luke 8:4-15).\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Brothers and sisters\n\nMost people use the terms “brother” and “sister” for those who have the same parents as they do. They think of them as some of the most important people in their lives. Some people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter, Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “having spent all her living on doctors”\n\nIn [8:43](../08/43.md), some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “having spent all her living on doctors,” but other manuscripts do not. ULT includes the phrase in its text, but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to whether it was an original part of the book of Luke. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the phrase if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
8:1	i6mi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:1	l399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατὰ πόλιν καὶ κώμην	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “around to different cities and villages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:1	l401		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “how God would rule” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:1	l402		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ δώδεκα	1	Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “his 12 apostles” or “the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
8:1	l403		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:2	g99l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αἳ ἦσαν τεθεραπευμέναι ἀπὸ πνευμάτων πονηρῶν καὶ ἀσθενειῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “whom Jesus had set free from evil spirits and healed of diseases” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:2	jq4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρία ἡ καλουμένη Μαγδαληνή	1	**Mary** is the name of a woman, and **Magdalene** is a distinguishing term that most likely means that she came from the town of Magdala. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:2	n4x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Μαρία ἡ καλουμένη Μαγδαληνή	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Mary, who people called Magdalene” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:2	l404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀφ’ ἧς δαιμόνια ἑπτὰ ἐξεληλύθει	1	The **demons** did not go **out** on their own. It may be helpful to say explicitly that Jesus drove them out. Alternate translation: “from whom Jesus had driven out seven demons” or “whom Jesus had set free from seven demons” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:3	tfz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωάννα & Σουσάννα	1	These are the names of two women. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

8:3	l405			ἐπιτρόπου Ἡρῴδου	1	Alternate translation: “the man who managed King Herod’s household affairs”
8:3	k9m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	διηκόνουν αὐτοῖς	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “were personally providing what Jesus and his 12 apostles needed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

8:4	l407		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	εἶπεν διὰ παραβολῆς	1	This means that Jesus told a brief story to teach something true in an understandable and memorable way. Alternate translation: “he told them this story to help them understand God’s ways better” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
8:5	ndc3			ἐξῆλθεν ὁ σπείρων τοῦ σπεῖραι τὸν σπόρον αὐτοῦ	1	Use either the singular or the plural to translate **seed** in this story, whichever would be more natural in your language.

8:5	n8bw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, you could also use an action clause to keep the sense of **sky**. Alternate translation: “birds” or “birds flew down and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
8:5	lt8n			κατέφαγεν αὐτό	1	Alternate translation: “ate it all” or “ate them all”
8:6	k6a4			ἐξηράνθη	1	Continue to use either the singular or the plural, whichever would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “each plant dried out and shriveled up” or “the plants dried out and shriveled up”
8:6	ktz7			διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ἰκμάδα	1	Alternate translation: “because there was no water for it in the rock” or “because there was no water for them in the rock”
8:7	xzq2			ἀπέπνιξαν αὐτό	1	The thorn plants took all the nutrients, water, and sunlight, so the farmer’s plants could not grow well. Continue to use either the singular or the plural, whichever would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “crowded it out” or “crowded them out” or “kept it from growing well” or “kept them from growing well”
8:8	q12t			ἐποίησεν καρπὸν ἑκατονταπλασίονα	1	Here the word translated **fruit** has the specific sense of “a crop.” Since the farmer is sowing wheat seeds, this crop would be more seeds. Alternate translation: “it produced a hundred times as much seed as had landed in this soil” or “they produced a hundred times as many seeds as had landed in this soil”
8:8	b92z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize that what he has just said is important and that it may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase **ears to hear** figuratively represents the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body by which his listeners would have been taking in his teaching. Alternate translation: “If anyone is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:8	l408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
8:8	l409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα ἀκούειν, ἀκουέτω	1	If you choose to translate this in the second person, **you** would be plural, since Jesus is speaking to the crowd. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
8:9	l410			τίς αὕτη εἴη ἡ παραβολή	1	Alternate translation: “What does this story mean?”
8:10	je1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑμῖν δέδοται γνῶναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

8:10	l6sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τοῖς δὲ λοιποῖς ἐν παραβολαῖς	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “but I speak in parables to the people who are not my disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
8:10	l412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἵνα βλέποντες μὴ βλέπωσιν, καὶ ἀκούοντες μὴ συνιῶσιν	1	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting the prophet Isaiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. For clarity, you could also indicate the source of the words that Jesus is quoting. Alternate translation: “so that as the prophet Isaiah said, though they see, they will not perceive, and though they hear, they will not understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
8:10	xtu6			βλέποντες μὴ βλέπωσιν	1	Some languages may need to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “though they see things, they will not understand them” or “though they see things happen, they will not understand what they mean”

8:12	jb9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	The word **hearts** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions.

8:12	l413		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶτα ἔρχεται ὁ διάβολος καὶ αἴρει τὸν λόγον ἀπὸ τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	Based on the figurative meaning of the parable, the implication is that these people did not appreciate the message deeply, just as seeds could not go down deep into the hard-packed soil of the path. And so the devil would be able to break up their superficial awareness and concentration by distracting them with everyday concerns. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the devil distracts them and they forget about the message they heard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

8:15	l416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν καρδίᾳ καλῇ καὶ ἀγαθῇ	1	The terms **honest** and **good** mean similar things. Jesus uses the two terms together for emphasis and clarity. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “with genuine intentions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
8:15	pbi7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν καρδίᾳ καλῇ καὶ ἀγαθῇ	1	In this expression, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “with genuine intentions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “whoever presumes that he already understands will understand less and less” or “God will not give greater understanding to anyone who presumes that he already understands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:19	l423		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	δὲ	1	Luke uses **then** to introduce a new event and to indicate that it came after the event he has just described. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
8:19	dw3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ	1	These were Jesus' younger brothers. They were sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you can use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
8:20	wr4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπηγγέλη & αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. The subject should be plural, since in the next verse Jesus responds to “them.” Alternate translation: “people told him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:20	l424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	σου & σου & σε	1	Since the person who said this was speaking to Jesus alone, **your** and **you** are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
8:20	un5d			ἰδεῖν θέλοντές σε	1	Alternate translation: “and they would like to see you”
8:21	l425		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the information that people gave him. Alternate translation: “But Jesus responded to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
8:21	b97u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μήτηρ μου καὶ ἀδελφοί μου, οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ ἀκούοντες καὶ ποιοῦντες	1	Jesus means figuratively that people who believe and obey the message from God become like a family to one another. Alternate translation: “Those who hear the word of God and obey it are like a mother and brothers to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:21	edk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to the message from God that people share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:22	l426		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:22	l427		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν μιᾷ τῶν ἡμερῶν	1	Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “around that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:22	l428		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ αὐτὸς ἐνέβη εἰς πλοῖον καὶ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ, καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς, διέλθωμεν εἰς τὸ πέραν τῆς λίμνης	1	It seems unlikely that Jesus and his disciples would have gotten into a boat before they were planning to sail somewhere. So here Luke is probably describing the result before the reason. If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to his disciples, ‘Let us go over to the other side of the lake.’ So they all got into a boat together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:22	w1pk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῆς λίμνης	1	This means the Lake of Genneseret, which is also called the Sea of Galilee. But since Jesus would have referred to it simply as “the lake” while he and his disciples were on it, you do not need to use the proper name in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:22	btk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνήχθησαν	1	This expression means that they began to travel across the lake in their boat. Alternate translation: “they headed out across the lake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:23	vh2v			πλεόντων & αὐτῶν	1	The term **voyaged** means that Jesus and the disciples traveled by water. Alternate translation: “as they traveled across the lake”
8:23	sf8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀφύπνωσεν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus began to sleep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:23	mdb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατέβη λαῖλαψ ἀνέμου εἰς τὴν λίμνην	1	Luke says **came down** because these winds blew down from the hills surrounding the lake. Alternate translation: “very strong winds suddenly began to blow on the lake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:23	l429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	συνεπληροῦντο	1	Luke says **they**, meaning the disciples, to refer figuratively by association to the boat they were in. Alternate translation: “the boat was being filled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:23	l430		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνεπληροῦντο	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state what was doing the action. Alternate translation: “water started to fill up their boat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:23	uki7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνεπληροῦντο	1	The implication is that the strong winds were causing high waves that pushed water over the sides of the boat, and that this water was filling the boat. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the strong winds were causing high waves that pushed water over the sides of their boat, so that the water began to fill it up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:24	l432			Ἐπιστάτα	1	**Master** is the title by which disciples addressed their teacher in this culture. If your language and culture have a similar term, you could use it here in your translation.
8:24	l431			λέγοντες, Ἐπιστάτα, Ἐπιστάτα, ἀπολλύμεθα!	1	The repetition indicates that the disciples called to Jesus urgently and continually. Alternate translation: “crying out continually, ‘Master! We’re going to die!’”
8:24	l433		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀπολλύμεθα	1	Since the disciples want Jesus to understand that he is in danger too, the word **we** would include him. Alternate translation: “We’re all going to die” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
8:24	uhe4			ἐπετίμησεν	1	Alternate translation: “spoke sharply to”
8:24	t1yy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τῷ κλύδωνι, τοῦ ὕδατος	1	In your language, it might seem that the wording here expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, you could also translate this as expressing emphasis. Alternate translation: “the waves” or “the violent waves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
8:24	v1c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐπαύσαντο καὶ ἐγένετο γαλήνη	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Luke uses the repetition to emphasize what great power Jesus demonstrated. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases. However, you could also translate both phrases and show how the second expresses the results of the first. Alternate translation: “the storm ended” or “the storm ended, so that the lake became calm again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
8:25	d8c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ποῦ ἡ πίστις ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus does not expect his disciples to tell him where their faith is. Rather, he is using the question form to correct them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should have trusted God!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:25	wjv3			τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν, ὅτι καὶ τοῖς ἀνέμοις ἐπιτάσσει καὶ τῷ ὕδατι, καὶ ὑπακούουσιν αὐτῷ?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could turn this into two sentences, one asking the question, and the other giving the reason for the question. Alternate translation: “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!”
8:25	f2wp			τίς ἄρα οὗτός ἐστιν	1	This is a genuine question, not a statement in question form. The disciples are looking for information about what kind of person Jesus could be if he can do this. Alternate translation: “What kind of man is this”
8:25	l434		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ ὕδατι	1	The disciples are figuratively describing the violent waves that had threatened the boat by reference to the water that these waves arose from. Alternate translation: “the waves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:26	f17p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὴν χώραν τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	The name **Gerasenes** refers to people from the city of Gerasa. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:26	p9zp			ἀντιπέρα τῆς Γαλιλαίας	1	Alternate translation: “on the other side of the lake from Galilee”
8:27	l435		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐξελθόντι & αὐτῷ	1	Here Luke is writing in a compact way. He means that Jesus **came out** of the boat. Alternate translation: “when Jesus got out of the boat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
8:27	hjh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀνήρ τις ἐκ τῆς πόλεως	1	This phrase introduces a new character in a story. If your language has an expression of its own that serves this purpose, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “a man who was from the city of Gerasa” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
8:27	ji6p			ἔχων δαιμόνια	1	Alternate translation: “who was controlled by demons” or “whom demons controlled”
8:27	xhw7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ χρόνῳ ἱκανῷ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce background information about the man who had demons. Alternate translation: “Now for a long time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
8:27	we6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῖς μνήμασιν	1	The term **the tombs** refers to places in which people laid to rest the bodies of loved ones who have died. In this context it may possibly mean caves cut into the rock or small buildings that the man could use for shelter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:28	ip59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἰδὼν & τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the man who had demons. Alternate translation: “when the man whom the demons controlled saw Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

8:28	fak9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	προσέπεσεν αὐτῷ	1	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that the man did not fall down accidentally. Rather, bowing or lying down in front of Jesus was a sign of humility and respect for him. Alternate translation: “respectfully bowed down at Jesus’ feet” or “respectfully lay down on the ground in front of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
8:28	m21e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	φωνῇ μεγάλῃ εἶπεν	1	This is an idiom that means the man raised the volume of his voice. Alternate translation: “shouted out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

8:28	l436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί	1	The man is using the question form to insist on something urgently.

8:28	ptt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου	1	**Son of the Most High God** is an important title for Jesus. See how you translated the expression **the Most High** in [1:32](../01/32.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
8:29	l437		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Luke is giving the reason for the result he described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “The man said this because” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:29	l438		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	παρήγγειλεν γὰρ τῷ πνεύματι τῷ ἀκαθάρτῳ ἐξελθεῖν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου	1	If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge and put this sentence in [8:28](../08/28.md), after the man bows down to Jesus but before he speaks, changing the tense of the verb to fit the context. You could also put the next sentence in this verse at the end of [8:27](../08/27.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
8:29	l439		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	πολλοῖς γὰρ χρόνοις	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce further background information about what the demon had done to the man before Jesus met him. Alternate translation: “Many times in the past” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

Luke appears to be describing how the demon would seize the man after he was bound and while he was being guarded. Alternate translation: “For though he was bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard, many times it had seized him” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events)
8:29	bxz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐδεσμεύετο ἁλύσεσιν καὶ πέδαις, φυλασσόμενος, καὶ διαρήσσων τὰ δεσμὰ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation (no comma following): “though the people in the area had bound him with chains and shackles and kept him under guard, he would break his bonds and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:29	bey5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠλαύνετο ὑπὸ τοῦ δαιμονίου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demon would make him go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:30	l440		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	σοι	1	Since Luke indicates in the previous verse that Jesus is speaking to the unclean spirit here, **your** is singular, even though the demon responds that he is speaking for “many,” and even though in the following verses Luke says **they** and **them** for the multiple demons. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
8:30	p31w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	λεγεών	1	Translate the word **Legion** with a word in your language that refers to a large number of soldiers. Show that this was the name of the demon by using the convention in your language for proper names.

8:31	qcn1			παρεκάλουν αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “the demons kept begging Jesus”
8:31	l441		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν Ἄβυσσον	1	The term **abyss** literally means a bottomless pit, and here it describes a place of punishment. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate the term with an explanatory phrase, as UST does, saying “the deep pit where God punishes demons.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:32	b3vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἦν δὲ ἐκεῖ ἀγέλη χοίρων ἱκανῶν βοσκομένη ἐν τῷ ὄρει	1	Luke supplies this background information to help readers understand what happens next. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
8:32	q8w5			ἦν & ἐκεῖ & βοσκομένη ἐν τῷ ὄρει	1	Alternate translation: “was nearby eating grass on the side of a hill”
8:32	l442		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	παρεκάλεσαν αὐτὸν ἵνα ἐπιτρέψῃ αὐτοῖς εἰς ἐκείνους εἰσελθεῖν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could clarify who and what these pronouns refer to. Alternate translation: “the demons begged Jesus to let them go into the pigs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:32	l443			καὶ ἐπέτρεψεν αὐτοῖς	1	Luke does not say specifically why Jesus allowed the demons to go into the pigs. But Jesus did not necessarily do so because the demons begged him. He may have had other reasons of his own. So it would probably be best to translate this in a neutral way, as ULT and UST both do, rather than beginning with a word such as “So,” which would imply that Jesus agreed to this because the demons begged him.
8:33	na38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐξελθόντα δὲ τὰ δαιμόνια	1	The term translated as **then** could mean that the demons came of out the man because Jesus told them they could go into the pigs. You could begin this sentence with the word **so**, as UST does, to show that. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:33	gz5x			ὥρμησεν	1	Alternate translation: “ran very fast”
8:33	ja6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ ἀπεπνίγη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. You do not need to specify someone who did this action to the pigs, because no one caused them to drown once they were in the water. Alternate translation: “and drowned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:34	l444		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	Here Luke uses a figure of speech to refer to that whole region by naming the two constituent parts of it. Alternate translation: “throughout the whole area” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
8:34	l445		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς τὴν πόλιν καὶ εἰς τοὺς ἀγρούς	1	You could also translate this more literally. The implication is that this means the city of Gerasa, since Luke says in [8:29](../08/29.md) that Jesus and his disciples came to the region where this city was located. Alternate translation: “in the city of Gerasa and in the surrounding countryside” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:35	l446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξῆλθον	1	Here, as well as in the other two instances in this verse, **they** refers to the people of that region, as in [8:37](../08/37.md). The term **went out** indicates the remote area where the man had been living. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express those things explicitly. Alternate translation: “people from all over that region went out to that remote area” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:35	ju71			εὗραν & τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἀφ’ οὗ τὰ δαιμόνια ἐξῆλθεν	1	Alternate translation: “saw the man whom the demons had left”

8:35	x9lp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καθήμενον & παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “sitting on the ground in front of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:35	j89t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν	1	The implication is that they were afraid of what else such a powerful person as Jesus might do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they were afraid of what else Jesus might do, since they recognized what great power he had” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:36	xtf3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οἱ ἰδόντες	1	Alternate translation: “those who had seen what had happened” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
8:36	kv18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐσώθη ὁ δαιμονισθείς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express both of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “Jesus had delivered the man from the demons who had controlled him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:37	l448		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος τῆς περιχώρου	1	This phrase means “everyone who lived in that area.” It is a generalization for emphasis, since every single resident of that region did not make this request. Rather, this was the general request of the crowd that came out to see what had happened. Alternate translation: “the crowd that had gathered from the region” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
8:37	ai7m			τῆς περιχώρου τῶν Γερασηνῶν	1	Alternate translation: “the area where the Gerasene people lived”
8:37	l449		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι φόβῳ μεγάλῳ συνείχοντο	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this phrase first in the sentence, since it gives the reason for the result that the rest of the sentence describes. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
8:37	jbh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φόβῳ μεγάλῳ συνείχοντο	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “they became very afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:37	l450		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	φόβῳ μεγάλῳ συνείχοντο	1	Luke speaks of this **fear** figuratively as if it were something that could actively take hold of these people. Alternate translation: “they became very afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
8:37	l451		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	αὐτὸς δὲ ἐμβὰς, εἰς πλοῖον	1	Luke figuratively says **he**, meaning Jesus, to describe the entire group of Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “Jesus and his disciples got into the boat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
8:37	ue8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπέστρεψεν	1	The implication is that Jesus and his disciples were going to return to Galilee. Alternate translation: “to go back across the lake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:38	s25w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	δὲ	1	The events in this verse and the next verse happened before Jesus left in the boat. It may be helpful to state that clearly at the beginning here. Alternate translation (followed by comma): “Before Jesus and his disciples left,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
8:38	l452		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἐδεῖτο & αὐτοῦ & εἶναι σὺν αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a direct quotation, as UST does, breaking the sentence here. Alternate translation: “pleaded with Jesus, ‘Let me go with you!’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
8:38	abce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπέλυσεν δὲ αὐτὸν	1	The pronoun**he** refers to Jesus, and the word **him** refers to the man. Alternate translation: “Jesus sent the man away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:39	zl3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν οἶκόν σου	1	Jesus is using the word **house** figuratively to mean the people who live in the man’s **house**. Alternate translation: “your household” or “your family” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:39	c9nh			διηγοῦ ὅσα σοι ἐποίησεν ὁ Θεός	1	Alternate translation: “tell them everything about what God has done for you”
8:39	l453		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθ’ ὅλην τὴν πόλιν	1	The implication is that this means the city of Gerasa, since Luke says in [8:29](../08/29.md) that Jesus and his disciples came to the region where this city was located. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “throughout the whole city of Gerasa” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:40	l454		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν δὲ τῷ ὑποστρέφειν τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	Luke figuratively says **he**, meaning Jesus, to describe the entire group of Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “Now when Jesus returned with his disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

You could put that information in a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “So Jesus agreed to go with him. Now as he was on his way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:42	l458		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

8:43	l460		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὅλον τὸν βίον	1	This phrase uses the term **living** figuratively to mean the money that was needed for **living**. Alternate translation: “all of her money” or “all the money she had to live on” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

8:45	c3wm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ ὄχλοι συνέχουσίν σε καὶ ἀποθλίβουσιν	1	By saying this, Peter was implying that anyone could have touched Jesus.

8:46	u6am		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἥψατό μού τις	1	The implication is that Jesus means someone reached out and **touched** him intentionally. He is not referring to the accidental jostling of the crowd. Alternate translation: “Someone deliberately touched me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:46	zmu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγὼ & ἔγνων δύναμιν ἐξεληλυθυῖαν ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Jesus did not lose power or become weak.

8:48	uja4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “because you believed, you have become well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

8:49	l465			ἔρχεταί τις	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “someone came”
8:49	deu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τις παρὰ τοῦ ἀρχισυναγώγου	1	This does not mean someone whom Jairus sent, since Jairus was with Jesus. Rather, this means someone who had been at his house watching over his daughter with the others. Alternate translation: “someone who had been at the home of Jairus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:49	id9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηκέτι σκύλλε τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	This statement implies that Jesus will not be able to do anything to help, since the girl is dead.

8:49	n6ez			τὸν διδάσκαλον	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
8:50	l466		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπεκρίθη αὐτῷ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, and the pronoun **him** refers to Jairus, not the messenger.

8:51	qal2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐκ ἀφῆκεν & τινα & εἰ μὴ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Luke was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause.

The term that ULT translates as **mourning** could mean that the people were pounding on their chests as a sign of grief, although Luke uses a much more specific expression to say that directly in [18:13](../18/13.md). If you think your readers might not understand the significance of these actions, you could explain generally what the people were doing. Or you could describe the actions and say why the people were doing them. Alternate translation: “they were all loudly expressing their grief” or “all the people there were wailing and pounding on their chests to show how sad they were that the girl had died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

8:54	l469		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἔγειρε	1	This was not a command that the girl was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused her to be raised from the dead. Alternate translation: “your life is restored, so get up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
8:55	k6w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπέστρεψεν τὸ πνεῦμα αὐτῆς	1	The people of this time considered life to be the result of the spirit coming into a person. You could express this in the way that would be most meaningful in your culture. Alternate translation: “she started breathing again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:56	c6mp			μηδενὶ εἰπεῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the verb negative and the subject positive. Alternate translation: “not to tell anyone”
9:intro	uc1r				0	# Luke 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus sends his 12 apostles to teach and heal (9:1-9)\n2. Jesus miraculously feeds 5,000 people (9:10-17)\n3. Jesus speaks with his disciples about who he is (9:18-27)\n4. The glory of Jesus is revealed on a mountaintop (9:28-36)\n5. Jesus drives a demon out of a boy (9:37-43)\n6. Jesus speaks about being his disciple (9:44-50)\n7. Jesus begins to travel to Jerusalem (9:51-62)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Elijah\n\nGod had promised the Jews that the prophet Elijah would return before the Messiah came. So some people who saw Jesus do miracles thought Jesus was Elijah (9:9, 9:19). He was not. However, Elijah did come to earth to speak with Jesus (9:30). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])\n\n### Glory\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Luke says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it” (9:24).\n\n### “Receiving”\n\nThis word appears several times in this chapter and means different things. When Jesus says, “If someone receives a little child like this in my name, he also is receiving me, and if someone receives me, he is also receiving the one who sent me” (9:48), he is speaking of people serving the child. When Luke says, “the people there did not receive him” (9:53), he means that the people did not believe in or accept Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])
9:1	l470		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	συνκαλεσάμενος & τοὺς δώδεκα	1	See how you translated this phrase in [8:1](../08/01.md). You may have decided to translate the nominal adjective **the Twelve** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “when he had called together his 12 apostles” or “when he had called together the 12 men whom he had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
9:1	l471		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τοὺς δώδεκα	1	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate this as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
9:1	zqq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	δύναμιν καὶ ἐξουσίαν	1	**Power** and **authority** mean similar things. Luke uses them together to show that Jesus gave his 12 disciples both the ability and the right to heal people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this phrase with a combination of words that includes both of these ideas. Alternate translation: “the right to use power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
9:1	fuj7			πάντα τὰ δαιμόνια	1	This could mean one of two things. Alternate translation: “every demon” or “every kind of demon”

9:3	m7c5			καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	It may be helpful to state that Jesus said these things to the disciples before they went out. Alternate translation: “Before the 12 disciples left, Jesus said to them”
9:3	aui6			μηδὲν αἴρετε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the verb negative and the subject positive. Alternate translation: “Do not bring anything”
9:3	l473		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς τὴν ὁδόν	1	Jesus uses the term **road** figuratively to refer to the journey that his disciples will make by traveling along roads. Alternate translation: “for your journey” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:3	qm2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ῥάβδον	1	The term **staff** means a large stick that people used for balance when climbing or when walking on uneven ground, and also for defense against animals and people.

9:3	l474		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀργύριον	1	Jesus figuratively uses a means by which value is stored and exchanged, **silver**, to represent money by association. Alternate translation: “money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:3	l475		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μήτε δύο χιτῶνας ἔχειν	1	Here Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. When he says that these men should not each have two tunics, he means that they each should only have one tunic. Alternate translation: “and do not bring an extra tunic” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
9:4	kyw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς ἣν ἂν οἰκίαν εἰσέλθητε	1	The implication is that the disciples can **enter** a house because the people living there have welcomed them.

9:5	ze2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τὸν κονιορτὸν ἀπὸ τῶν ποδῶν ὑμῶν ἀποτινάσσετε	1	This action was an expression of strong rejection in this culture. It showed that someone did not want even the dust of a town to remain on them. If there is a similar gesture in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation.

When John sends messengers to Jesus in [7:18-19](../07/18.md), he does this from prison. But by this point in the story, John is dead, because Herod has executed him. Luke assumes that his readers will know that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could tell them explicitly. Alternate translation: “that John the Baptist, whom Herod had executed, had risen from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:7	l478		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to John the Baptist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “and it was said by some that Elijah had appeared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
9:8	l480		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἄλλων δὲ, ὅτι προφήτης τις τῶν ἀρχαίων ἀνέστη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form.

9:9	r98f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	Ἰωάννην ἐγὼ ἀπεκεφάλισα	1	Herod speaks of himself figuratively as the person who did this action, representing the entire group of people who were responsible for it.

9:12	l485		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate this as a title, **the Twelve**, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns.

To make sure that this is clear to your readers, you may wish to use a different expression than “the third day” or “day three,” especially if, in your culture, this would mean one day longer than Jesus intends. Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” or “day two” according to the way your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “and he will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, he will come back to life” or (if you translated in the first person) “and I will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, I will come back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Rather, he is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “It would not benefit a person to get everything he wanted in this world and yet be lost eternally.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
9:25	l496		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τί γὰρ ὠφελεῖται ἄνθρωπος, κερδήσας τὸν κόσμον ὅλον, ἑαυτὸν δὲ ἀπολέσας ἢ ζημιωθείς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form.

9:35	l733		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ ἐκλελεγμένος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could indicate who has done the action.

9:36	l509		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εὑρέθη Ἰησοῦς μόνος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state **Jesus was found alone** with an active form. Alternate translation: “only Jesus was there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:36	v9uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	αὐτοὶ ἐσίγησαν, καὶ οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. (The Greek verb in the first phrase does not always mean to make no sound. It can also mean to keep a secret.) Luke uses the two phrases together for emphasis. In your translation, you could also use repetition for emphasis, or, If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “they kept it a secret and did not tell anyone” or “they said nothing about it to anyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
9:36	l510		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδενὶ ἀπήγγειλαν & οὐδὲν	1	Luke uses a double negative in Greek for emphasis here, “told no one … nothing.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “told someone … something.” If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
9:36	l511		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείναις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Here Luke uses the term **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
9:37	q5f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
9:38	l512		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:38	k35b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man in the crowd who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
9:38	l513			Διδάσκαλε	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
9:38	l514		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐπιβλέψαι ἐπὶ	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “help” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
9:39	l515		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The man uses the term **behold** to calls Jesus’ attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:39	ka7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	πνεῦμα	1	The man uses this phrase to introduce the spirit into his story.

Alternate translation: “there is an evil spirit that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
9:39	abm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μετὰ ἀφροῦ	1	When a person is having convulsions, they can have trouble breathing or swallowing. This causes white foam to form around their mouths. Alternate translation: “and foam comes out of his mouth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
9:39	l516		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μόγις ἀποχωρεῖ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	The man is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “it attacks him very often” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
9:39	l517		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	συντρῖβον αὐτόν	1	The man speaks figuratively of the spirit as if it were a heavy weight whose attacks crush the boy.

9:41	sdu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Together **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the man’s request. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
9:41	bi9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus is speaking figuratively to something that he knows cannot hear him. He is addressing the entire **generation** of people who were living at that time, and they are not all present to hear him. He is doing this to show in a very strong way how he feels about this generation. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the crowd that has gathered there. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to the crowd, since they are included in the generation that Jesus is figuratively addressing. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe, so I hope I do not have to stay here and put up with you for very long!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
9:41	l518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη, ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis.

9:41	apa3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἄπιστος καὶ διεστραμμένη	1	The terms **unbelieving** and **perverted** mean similar things. Jesus uses them together for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
9:41	qk1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ἕως πότε ἔσομαι πρὸς ὑμᾶς καὶ ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν?	1	In both cases here, **you** is plural in Greek because Jesus is addressing a **generation** that is made up of many people. However, **generation** is a collective noun, and if your language would treat a collective noun as singular in a context like this, you could use the singular form of **you**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
9:41	ls7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	προσάγαγε ὧδε τὸν υἱόν σου	1	Jesus is now speaking to the father of the boy, and so **your** is singular here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
9:42	l519		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔτι & προσερχομένου αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the boy, not to the father. Alternate translation: “while the boy was coming” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
9:43	hz1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξεπλήσσοντο δὲ πάντες ἐπὶ τῇ μεγαλειότητι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus performed the miracle, but the crowd recognized that **God** was the power behind the healing. Alternate translation: “Then they were all amazed that God would work so powerfully through Jesus in this way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:43	d61c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πᾶσιν οἷς ἐποίει	1	The word **he** refers to Jesus, not to God the Father. Alternate translation: “everything Jesus was doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

9:44	im3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ γὰρ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form.

9:44	ygr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ γὰρ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι	1	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person.

9:44	l520		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ γὰρ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου μέλλει παραδίδοσθαι	1	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “someone is going to betray me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:44	l521		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων	1	The term **hands** figuratively represent power and control. Alternate translation: “to his enemies, who will have power over him” or (if you translated in the first person) “to my enemies, who will have power over me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:44	l522		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων	1	It may be helpful to make explicit who these **men** are. Alternate translation: “to his enemies, who will have power over him” or (if you translated in the first person) “to my enemies, who will have power over me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:45	l523		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ῥῆμα τοῦτο & περὶ τοῦ ῥήματος τούτου	1	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to describe what Jesus said by using words. Alternate translation: “this saying … about this saying” or “this statement … about this statement” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:45	ub1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἦν παρακεκαλυμμένον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God hid its meaning from them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:46	dh3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that the pronoun **them** does not include Jesus. He was not arguing, along with the disciples, about who was the **greatest**. Alternate translation: “among the disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
9:46	l524			τίς ἂν εἴη μείζων αὐτῶν	1	Alternate translation: “which one of them was the greatest”
9:47	cx62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰδὼς τὸν διαλογισμὸν τῆς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	Here Luke uses **hearts** figuratively to represent the disciples’ thoughts and evaluations. Alternate translation: “knowing what they were thinking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:48	l525		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τοῦτο τὸ παιδίον	1	Jesus is using the **child** as an extreme example. He is illustrating that since he will be present in even the most humble of his followers, the disciples do not need to argue among themselves about which of them is the greatest. Everyone who is working on behalf of Jesus possesses his full honor and dignity. Alternate translation: “even someone as seemingly insignificant as this child” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
9:48	afx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here, **name** is a figurative way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with him. Alternate translation: “as someone who is working on my behalf” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:48	mav1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐμὲ δέχεται	1	This is a metaphor, but If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate it as a simile. Alternate translation: “it is as if he is welcoming me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:48	awc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that this means God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God, who sent me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:48	zw5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οὗτός ἐστιν μέγας	1	Here Jesus uses the pronoun **he** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “that is the person whom God considers to be great” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
9:49	uwr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ Ἰωάννης εἶπεν	1	Together **answering** and **said** mean that John responded to what Jesus had just said. Alternate translation: “Then John responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
9:49	bj41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	εἴδομέν & μεθ’ ἡμῶν	1	When John says **we**, he is speaking of himself and some other disciples who spoke to this man, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language uses that form. However, when John says **us**, he seems to be referring to the disciples and Jesus traveling together, and since he is speaking to Jesus, **us** would be inclusive. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
9:49	py8i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου	1	The term **name** is a figurative way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with them. This expression means the person was acting with the power and authority of Jesus. Alternate translation: “on your behalf” or “as your representative” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:49	l526		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἀκολουθεῖ μεθ’ ἡμῶν	1	In this case, to **follow** Jesus does not seem to mean to be one of his disciples, as in [5:27](../05/27.md), since this man was acting in Jesus’ **name**. Rather, in this context it seems to refer to traveling together in this group with Jesus. Alternate translation: “he does not travel with you in our group” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:50	hw85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μὴ κωλύετε	1	Jesus is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. You can state this positively. Alternate translation: “Allow him to continue” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
9:51	l527		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
9:51	c8gx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας τῆς ἀναλήμψεως αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active verbal forms in place of these two passive forms, and in the second case you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time for God to take him up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:51	l528		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὰς ἡμέρας	1	Here Luke uses **days** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
9:51	l529		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς ἀναλήμψεως αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that God would take Jesus back up to heaven, and the further implication is that this would be after Jesus died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express one or both of those things explicitly. Alternate translation: “for God to take him up to heaven” or “for him to die and for God to take him back up to heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:51	mq2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ πρόσωπον ἐστήρισεν	1	**Set his face** is an idiom. Alternate translation: “he firmly decided” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
9:52	l530		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ	1	The term **face** figuratively means the front of a person. Alternate translation: “ahead of him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Samaria was between Galilee and Judea, and the people who lived there were not Jewish and they were hostile to the Jews. The terms **Samaritan** and Samaria occur several times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
9:52	b6ct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὡς ἑτοιμάσαι αὐτῷ	1	This phrase means to make arrangements in anticipation of his arrival there, such as for food to eat, a place to stay, and possibly also a place to speak. Alternate translation: “to arrange his accommodations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
9:53	v61k			οὐκ ἐδέξαντο αὐτόν	1	Alternate translation: “the Samaritans did not want him to stay with them”
9:53	l532		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἦν πορευόμενον εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	Luke is using one part of Jesus to represent all of him. Luke may use the **face** because Jesus was facing in the direction he was traveling. Or this may echo the expression “he set his face” in [9:52](../09/52.md). Alternate translation: “he was traveling toward Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
9:53	n62j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ ἦν πορευόμενον εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	The Samaritans and the Jews hated each other. Therefore the Samaritans did not want to help Jesus travel to Jerusalem, which was the Jewish capital and the place where the Jews held their major religious observances. Alternate translation: “because they did not want to help any Jew make a journey to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:54	a8sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδόντες	1	The word **saw** figuratively represents notice and attention. Alternate translation: “recognized that the Samaritans were not going to accommodate Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:54	y4rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	θέλεις εἴπωμεν πῦρ καταβῆναι ἀπὸ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ ἀναλῶσαι αὐτούς?	1	James and John suggested this method of judgment because they knew that this was how the prophets such as Elijah had called down judgment upon people who rejected God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “do you want us to tell fire to come down from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:54	l533		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	θέλεις εἴπωμεν	1	By **us**, James and John mean themselves, but not Jesus, so **us** is exclusive. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
9:55	pj6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	στραφεὶς & ἐπετίμησεν αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to James and John. Jesus did not condemn the Samaritans, as the disciples expected. Alternate translation: “Jesus turned around and rebuked James and John” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
9:57	l534			τις	1	This was not one of the disciples. Alternate translation: “a certain person”
9:58	yq5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	αἱ ἀλώπεκες φωλεοὺς ἔχουσιν, καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech. By naming a creature that lives on land and a creature that flies in the air, Jesus is referring to all creatures. Alternate translation: “Every creature has a place to live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
9:58	anv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	αἱ ἀλώπεκες φωλεοὺς ἔχουσιν	1	The word **foxes** describes land animals that are similar to small dogs. The word **dens** refers to holes that these animals dig in the ground as shelters. If your readers would not be familiar with this animal and its habits, you could describe them in general terms. Alternate translation: “Little animals live in holes in the ground” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
9:58	c88m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις	1	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it. However, you could also use an action clause to keep the sense of **sky**, to complement the idea of “ground” in the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “birds live in nests” or “birds that fly in the air live in nests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
9:58	ls02		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατασκηνώσεις	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “birds live in nests” or “birds that fly in the air live in nests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
9:58	r7vq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ & Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	**Jesus** is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
9:58	l535		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:58	l536		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	Jesus implies that if this person were to follow him, he too might not have a home. Alternate translation: “does not have a home anywhere, so if you become his disciple, expect that you will not have a home either” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a home anywhere, so if you become my disciple, expect that you will not have a home either” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:58	l537		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	This expression figuratively means “does not have anywhere to sleep,” by association with something that a person does in order to sleep, **lay** down his **head**. And a place to sleep, by association, means a home, since that is where people sleep. Alternate translation: “does not have a home anywhere” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a home anywhere” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:58	ff62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἔχει ποῦ τὴν κεφαλὴν κλίνῃ	1	Jesus actually did find places to sleep wherever he went to teach and heal, but he says figuratively that he has no such place at all to emphasize that he has no permanent home. Alternate translation: “does not have a permanent home” or (if you translated in the first person) “do not have a permanent home” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
9:59	l538		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀκολούθει μοι	1	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to become one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “I want you to be one of my disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:59	l539			ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀπελθόντι, πρῶτον θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου	1	It is unclear whether the man’s father had died and that he would bury him immediately, or whether the man wanted to wait for a longer amount of time until his father died so that he could bury him then. The main point is that the man wanted to do something else first before going with Jesus. Alternate translation: “before I do that, let me go and bury my father”
9:59	l540		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπίτρεψόν μοι ἀπελθόντι, πρῶτον θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου	1	One possible meaning of this expression is that the man wanted to wait until he had received his inheritance from his father so that he could live on that money while traveling with Jesus. If so, then he would be referring to the inheritance by association with his father’s death, and he would be referring to his father’s death by association with his burial. Alternate translation: “let me wait until I receive my inheritance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:60	l541		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἄφες τοὺς νεκροὺς θάψαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκρούς	1	Jesus does not mean literally that dead people will bury other dead people. Instead, the expression **the dead** likely refers figuratively to those who do not follow Jesus and so are spiritually dead. Alternate translation: “Let people who are not concerned about spiritual things take care of everyday matters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:60	l542		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς νεκροὺς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are dead” or “people who are not concerned about spiritual things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
9:60	l543		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “how God will rule” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
9:61	l544		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀκολουθήσω σοι	1	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to become one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “I want to be one of your disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:61	l545			πρῶτον δὲ ἐπίτρεψόν μοι	1	Alternate translation: “but before I do that, please let me”
9:61	l546		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῖς εἰς τὸν οἶκόν μου	1	This person is referring figuratively to his family by association with where they live. Alternate translation: “to my family” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:62	l547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον καὶ βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω, εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus responds with an illustration that is designed to teach this person about what is required to be his disciple. He means that a person is not suitable for the kingdom to God if his past loyalties are more important to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this illustration. Alternate translation, add: “No one can plow straight if he is looking backwards, and in the same way, no one will be useful in the kingdom of God if his past loyalties are more important to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:62	l548		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	Jesus refers figuratively to a person using a plow by describing one part of that activity, guiding the plow with the **hand**. Alternate translation: “No one who is using a plow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
9:62	l553		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐδεὶς ἐπιβαλὼν τὴν χεῖρα αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἄροτρον	1	A **plow** is a tool that farmers use to break up soil to prepare a field for planting. Plows have sharp, pointed prongs that dig into the soil. They usually have handles that the farmer uses to guide the plow. If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of tool, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “No one who needs to go straight forward” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
9:62	l549		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βλέπων εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	The implication is that anyone who is looking backwards while plowing cannot guide the plow where it needs to go. That person must focus on looking forward in order to plow well. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “looking backwards, and so not going in the right direction” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:62	l550		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εὔθετός ἐστιν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “can really let God rule his life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:intro	z899				0	# Luke 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus sends seventy-two disciples to teach and heal (10:1-24)\n2. Jesus tells the Parable of the Good Samaritan (10:25-37)\n3. Jesus visits Mary and Martha (10:38-43)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Harvest\n\nHarvest refers to the time when people gather in the food they have planted so they can eat some of it right away and store the rest for future use. Jesus uses this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about him so that those people can become part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Neighbor\n\nThe Jews helped their Jewish neighbors who needed help, and they expected their Jewish neighbors to help them. Jesus wanted them to understand that people who were not Jews were also their neighbors, so he told them a story about this (10:29-37). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “72”\n\nIn 10:1 and 10:17, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible read “72,” but others read “70.” ULT reads “72,” but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to which number was originally in the book of Luke.\n\n### “Jesus”\n\nIn 10:39, many of the best ancient manuscripts read “Jesus,” but some read “the Lord.” ULT reads “Jesus.”\n\nIn both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
10:1	u8l6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα	1	Luke uses this phrase to mark a new event in the story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses for this same purpose, you could use that here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
10:1	l551			ὁ Κύριος	1	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the title **the Lord** to show his authority. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
10:1	m75c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to say **72** or “70” in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
10:1	g8ka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπέστειλεν αὐτοὺς ἀνὰ δύο	1	This phrase is an idiom. Alternate translation: “sent them out two by two” or “sent them out in groups of two” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:1	l554		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **face** figuratively means the front of a person. Alternate translation: “ahead of him” or “to prepare the way for him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:2	fx9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ἔλεγεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς	1	Jesus said these things to the 72 disciples before they actually went out. Alternate translation: “He had said to them” or “Before they went out, he told them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
10:2	ju6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ μὲν θερισμὸς πολύς, οἱ δὲ ἐργάται ὀλίγοι	1	This statement means, “There is a big crop, but there are not enough workers to bring it in.” Jesus is speaking figuratively. Alternate translation: “There are many people who are ready to enter God’s kingdom, but there are not enough disciples to help them understand how to do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:2	l555		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	τοῦ Κυρίου τοῦ θερισμοῦ	1	Jesus continues to speak figuratively and extends his metaphor by describing God as **the Lord of the harvest**. Alternate translation: “God, who leads people to believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
10:2	l556		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ὅπως ἐργάτας ἐκβάλῃ εἰς τὸν θερισμὸν αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus extends his metaphor even further by describing disciples who help others to trust in him as **laborers** in the **harvest**. Alternate translation: “to send more disciples to go and help people trust in me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
10:3	x732		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπάγετε	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly where Jesus wants these disciples to go. Alternate translation: “Go to the cities and places where I am sending you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:3	l557		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get his disciples to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:3	u8h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἀποστέλλω ὑμᾶς ὡς ἄρνας ἐν μέσῳ λύκων	1	Wolves attack and kill sheep. This simile is a warning to the disciples whom Jesus is sending out that there will be people who will want to harm them. You could explain the meaning of this figurative expression in your translation. (However, you could also reproduce the simile, as suggested in the next note.) Alternate translation: “when I send you out, there are going to be some people who will want to harm you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
10:3	l558		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀποστέλλω ὑμᾶς ὡς ἄρνας ἐν μέσῳ λύκων	1	Jesus’ disciples would have known that **lambs** are gentle animals that have been domesticated for their wool, milk, meat, and leather, and that **wolves** are predatory land animals, similar to large dogs, that hunt and kill in packs. If you would like to reproduce the simile, but your readers would not be familiar with these animals, you could use general terms. Alternate translation: “I am sending you out like harmless animals that will encounter a group of predators” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
10:3	l559		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμᾶς	1	Since Jesus is speaking to these 72 disciples as a group, **you** is plural here and through [10:12](../10/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
10:4	l560		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	Here Jesus is using the word **carry** in an idiomatic sense to mean “bring along.” He is not envisioning that these disciples might carry their sandals in their hands. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:4	fz6p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	While Jesus probably means what he says literally about not bringing these specific items, he is also using them figuratively with larger meanings. The **money bag** represents the money it would contain. The **sack** represents the provisions someone would carry in it for a journey. The **sandals** represent, in this culture, more clothing and equipment than is strictly needed. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:4	l561		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ βαστάζετε βαλλάντιον, μὴ πήραν, μὴ ὑποδήματα	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why Jesus does not want his disciples to bring these things with them. As he will explain in [10:7](../10/07.md), he wants the people who receive his message to provide for those who bring the message. Alternate translation: “Do not bring any money or provisions or extra clothes with you, because the people who receive my message will provide for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:4	tj52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	μηδένα κατὰ τὴν ὁδὸν ἀσπάσησθε	1	Jesus is generalizing to indicate that these disciples should go quickly to the places where he is sending them to prepare the way for him. He is not telling them to be rude. Alternate translation: “make your journey as quickly as possible” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
10:5	l562		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what he wants his disciples to say. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “say that you want there to be peace in that house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
10:5	zk69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	The term **house** refers figuratively to the people who live in the house. Alternate translation: “May the people in this household have peace” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:5	l563		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰρήνη τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	This was an idiomatic expression, based on the Hebrew concept of “shalom,” that was both a greeting and a blessing. Alternate translation: “I greet all of you in this household and I wish for God to bless you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:6	x5e4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	υἱὸς εἰρήνης	1	The expression **son of** refers figuratively to a person who shares the qualities of something. Alternate translation: “a person who wants peace with God and with people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:6	pq5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπαναπαήσεται ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἡ εἰρήνη ὑμῶν	1	Here, **upon** creates a spatial metaphor. It means that this person will experience the peace that God gives in a special and lasting way. Alternate translation: “he will deeply experience the peace that you wish him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:6	it4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἰ & μή γε	1	It may be helpful to restate the entire phrase. Alternate translation: “if there is no one there who wants peace with God and with people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
10:6	zpx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἀνακάμψει	1	Jesus describes **peace** as a living thing that could choose to leave one person and go to another person. Alternate translation: “you will experience that peace yourselves instead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
10:7	ki3k			ἐν αὐτῇ δὲ τῇ οἰκίᾳ μένετε	1	Jesus was not saying that they should stay in the house all the time and never leave it, but that they should make it their base of operations for as long as they were in that place. Alternate translation: “stay at that house”
10:7	l564		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὰ παρ’ αὐτῶν	1	This phrase is an idiom. Alternate translation: “the food and drink that they provide” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:7	u3vs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	ἄξιος γὰρ ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life, to explain the reason for these arrangements. You could translate the proverb directly into your language, or you could explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “for since you will be teaching and healing the people, they should provide you with a place to stay and food to eat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
10:7	kd8i			μὴ μεταβαίνετε ἐξ οἰκίας εἰς οἰκίαν	1	This expression describes staying in different houses rather than making one house the base of operations the whole time. Jesus is repeating his earlier instruction, **remain in that house**, for emphasis. Jesus is not saying that these disciples cannot go to meet with people in other homes. Alternate translation: “As I said, stay at that house”
10:8	k8yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ δέχωνται ὑμᾶς	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people living in this city. Alternate translation: “if the people there welcome you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
10:8	wd2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐσθίετε τὰ παρατιθέμενα ὑμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “eat whatever food the people of that city serve you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:9	ws6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς & ἀσθενεῖς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the people who are sick” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
10:9	l565		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Alternate translation: “who live in that city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
10:9	l566		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε αὐτοῖς, ἤγγικεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “tell them that the kingdom of God has come close to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
10:9	e1he		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἤγγικεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** can be expressed with a verb such as “rule.” This could mean: (1) the kingdom of God is close in location, that is, its activities are happening nearby. Alternate translation: “God is ruling in this area” (2) the kingdom of God is close in time, that is, it will begin soon. Alternate translation: “God will soon begin to rule as king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:10	nt9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ μὴ δέχωνται ὑμᾶς	1	This is a direct contrast to the similar expression in [10:8](../10/08.md). Once again the pronoun **they** refers to the people living in this city. Alternate translation: “if the people there do not welcome you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
10:11	l567		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ τὸν κονιορτὸν τὸν κολληθέντα ἡμῖν, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς πόδας ἀπομασσόμεθα ὑμῖν; πλὴν τοῦτο γινώσκετε, ὅτι ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Luke is quoting Jesus, and Jesus is quoting what he wants his disciples to say. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing from the end of the previous verse): “that you are going to wipe even the dust from their city off your feet as a warning to them, but that you still want them to know that the kingdom of God came close to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
10:11	bc9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	καὶ τὸν κονιορτὸν τὸν κολληθέντα ἡμῖν, ἐκ τῆς πόλεως ὑμῶν εἰς τοὺς πόδας ἀπομασσόμεθα ὑμῖν	1	This is a symbolic action by which these disciples are to show that they do not want to have the slightest connection with the people of any city who reject Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain its significance. Alternate translation: “Because you have rejected Jesus, we want to have nothing to do with you. We do not even want to have the dust from your town on our feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
10:11	l634		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ἀπομασσόμεθα	1	Since Jesus was sending these people out in groups of two, two people would be saying this. So languages that have a dual form of “we” should use that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
10:11	s7ks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πλὴν τοῦτο γινώσκετε	1	The phrase introduces a warning. Alternate translation: “But we must warn you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:11	fdk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you translated the similar sentence in [10:9](../10/09.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
10:12	hhl1			λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅτι	1	Jesus says this to emphasize that what he is about to tell these disciples is very important. Alternate translation: “Take special note that”
10:12	l568		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	Jesus is using the term **day** to refer figuratively to a specific time. Alternate translation: “when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:12	m7ch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	Jesus expected his disciples to understand that he was referring to the time when God will bring final judgment. Alternate translation: “when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:12	qg62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Σοδόμοις & ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται, ἢ τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	Jesus uses the name of the city, **Sodom**, to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “God will judge the people of that town more severely than he will judge the people of Sodom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:12	l569		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Σοδόμοις & ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται, ἢ τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the city of Sodom because the people in it were so wicked. The implication is that it must therefore be an extremely serious offense to reject the messengers of the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “God will judge the people of that town more severely than he will judge the people of Sodom, even though he destroyed their city because they were so wicked” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:13	sf42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Jesus is speaking figuratively to two cities that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this to show in a very strong way how he feels about those cities. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “Chorazin and Bethsaida are two of the cities whose people God will judge severely for rejecting my message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
10:13	l570		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	See how you translated this phrase in [6:24](../06/24.md). Alternate translation: “how terrible it will be for you, Chorazin and Bethsaida!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:13	l571		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Jesus is using the names of these cities to refer figuratively to the people who live there. Alternate translation: “How terrible it will be for you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:13	l572		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	οὐαί σοι, Χοραζείν! οὐαί σοι, Βηθσαϊδά!	1	Jesus is addressing an individual city in each of these phrases, so **you** is singular in both cases. However, if you decide to translate this as “you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida,” then **you** would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
10:13	l573		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Χοραζείν & Βηθσαϊδά!	1	These are the names of two cities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
10:13	mvq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ὅτι εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγενήθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν, πάλαι ἂν & μετενόησαν	1	Jesus is describing a situation that might have happened in the past but actually did not. He is doing this to express disappointment and regret about what is happening in the present. Be sure to translate this in such a way that your readers will know that this event actually did not happen but they will understand why Jesus is imagining it. Alternate translation: “I can well imagine that if the people of Tyre and Sidon had witnessed the miracles that I performed for you, they would have repented a long time ago” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
10:13	l574		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι εἰ ἐν Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι ἐγενήθησαν αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν, πάλαι ἂν & μετενόησαν	1	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because the people in them were so wicked. So the implication is similar to the one about the people of Sodom. Alternate translation: “God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because they were so wicked. But even the people who lived in those cities would have repented if they had seen the miracles I did in Chorazin and Bethsaida. So the people of Chorazin and Bethsaida certainly should have repented as well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:13	l575		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι	1	Jesus uses the names of these cities to refer figuratively to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: “the people of Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:13	l576		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι	1	**Tyre** and **Sidon** are the names of two cities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
10:13	l577		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	αἱ δυνάμεις, αἱ γενόμεναι ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Since Jesus is addressing two cities, **you** would be dual here if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
10:13	it4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἂν ἐν σάκκῳ καὶ σποδῷ καθήμενοι μετενόησαν	1	Jesus is saying that the people of Tyre and Sidon would have performed these actions, which are signs of humility and sorrow, to show that they were very sorry for committing their sins. Alternate translation: “they would have shown how sorry they were for their sins … by sitting on the ground wearing rough clothes and putting ashes on their heads” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
10:14	l578		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται & ἢ ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses the names of these cities, **Tyre** and **Sidon**, to refer figuratively to the people who lived there.

10:14	ikt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται & ἢ ὑμῖν	1	Jesus assumes that these disciples will know that God destroyed the cities of Tyre and Sidon because the people in them were so wicked. The implication, as in the case of Sodom, is that it must therefore be an extremely grave offense to reject the messengers of the kingdom of God. Alternate translation: “God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon, even though he destroyed their cities because they were so wicked” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:14	l579		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Τύρῳ καὶ Σιδῶνι, ἀνεκτότερον ἔσται & ἢ ὑμῖν	1	It may be helpful to state clearly the reason why God will judge Chorazin and Bethsaida. Alternate translation: “because you did not repent and believe in me even though you saw me do miracles, God will judge you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida more severely than he will judge the people who lived in Tyre and Sidon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:14	txw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ κρίσει	1	The disciples would have understood that Jesus was referring to the time when God will bring final judgment. Alternate translation: “at the time when God judges everyone for what they have done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:14	l580		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ὑμῖν	1	Since Jesus is addressing two cities, **you** would be dual here if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. Alternate translation: “you people of Chorazin and Bethsaida” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
10:15	h28u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	Jesus is speaking figuratively to another city that he knows cannot hear him. He is doing this once again to show in a very strong way how he feels about this city. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the disciples whom he is sending out. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate Jesus’ words as if he were speaking directly to his disciples. Alternate translation: “The people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor them greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
10:15	l581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	In Greek, the first word of the question that Jesus asks Capernaum is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **will you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum, do you really think that God is going to honor you greatly?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
10:15	enp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
10:15	gk9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σύ, Καφαρναούμ, μὴ ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ?	1	To be **exalted** or “lifted up” is a spatial metaphor that figuratively indicates receiving honor. To be lifted all the way up **to heaven** (or “to the sky,” another possible meaning) figuratively means to receive very great honor. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum are wrong to think that God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:15	l582		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σύ, Καφαρναούμ	1	Jesus uses the name of this city to refer figuratively to the people who live there. Alternate translation: “you people of Capernaum” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:15	l583		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	σύ, Καφαρναούμ	1	Jesus is addressing an individual city, so **you** is singular here and in the rest of this verse. However, if you decide to translate this as “you people of Capernaum,” then **you** would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
10:15	l584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Καφαρναούμ	1	**Capernaum** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
10:15	l585		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “God is going to honor you greatly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:15	l586		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως οὐρανοῦ ὑψωθήσῃ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the reason why the people of Capernaum think that God would want to honor them. Alternate translation: “God is going to honor you greatly because you are such good people and your city is so prosperous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:15	l587		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	To be **brought down** is another spatial metaphor. It figuratively indicates experiencing punishment and dishonor. To be brought down all the way to Hades, the underworld (that is, the abode of the dead), figuratively means to receive very great punishment or dishonor. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:15	bjh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:15	l588		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ ᾍδου καταβήσῃ	1	It may be helpful to state clearly the reason why God will judge Capernaum. Alternate translation: “God is going to punish you severely because you did not repent and believe in me, even though you saw me do miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:16	i786		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀκούων ὑμῶν, ἐμοῦ ἀκούει	1	You could translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “When someone listens to you, it is as if they were listening to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:16	q56b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀθετῶν ὑμᾶς, ἐμὲ ἀθετεῖ	1	You could also translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “when someone rejects you, it is as if they were rejecting me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:16	g3fx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ & ἐμὲ ἀθετῶν, ἀθετεῖ τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	You could also translate this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “when someone rejects me, it is as if they were rejecting the one who sent me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:16	eus8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἀποστείλαντά με	1	This refers implictly to God, who appointed Jesus for this special task. Alternate translation: “God who sent me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:17	m7nh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπέστρεψαν δὲ οἱ ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	Some languages will need to say that the 72 actually went out first, as UST does. Alternate translation: “So the 72 disciples went out and did as Jesus had told them to do, and then they returned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:17	prj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἑβδομήκοντα δύο	1	As in [10:1](../10/01.md), see the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to say **72** or “70” in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
10:17	l589		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ δαιμόνια ὑποτάσσεται ἡμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demons obey us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:17	cx7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί σου	1	The term **name** refers figuratively to Jesus’ power and authority. Alternate translation: “when we command them using the authority that you gave us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
10:18	a37w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἐθεώρουν τὸν Σατανᾶν ὡς ἀστραπὴν ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πεσόντα	1	Jesus uses a simile to express that while his 72 disciples were out proclaiming the kingdom of God, he discerned that this was a quick and decisive defeat for Satan. If your readers would be familiar with lightning, you could use the same simile in your translation. Otherwise, you could use another comparison to something that happens rapidly and evidently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
10:18	v8fl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ πεσόντα	1	While Jesus actually did see this in his vision, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this image, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:18	l590		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σατανᾶν	1	**Satan** is the name of the devil. It occurs a few more times in this book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
10:19	l591		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus uses **behold** to focus his disciples’ attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:19	xl7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν ἐξουσίαν τοῦ πατεῖν ἐπάνω ὄφεων καὶ σκορπίων	1	This could mean: (1) Jesus is referring to actual **snakes and scorpions** and saying that God will protect his disciples from these dangers everywhere they travel to proclaim the kingdom. Alternate translation: “protection from snakes and scorpions, even if you step on them” (2) the phrase **snakes and scorpions** is a figurative way of describing evil spirits. Alternate translation: “the power to defeat evil spirits” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:19	l592		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὄφεων	1	In context, this clearly means poisonous **snakes**. If your readers would not be familiar with **snakes**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “poisonous biting animals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
10:19	mla6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σκορπίων	1	The term **scorpions** describes small animals that are related to spiders. They have two claws and a poisonous stinger in their tail. If your readers would not be familiar with **scorpions**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “poisonous stinging animals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
10:19	uvt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἐπὶ πᾶσαν τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ ἐχθροῦ	1	This phrase continues the meaning from earlier in the sentence. The **enemy** is Satan, as described in the previous verse. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I have also given you authority to overcome the resistance of Satan” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:19	l593		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν ὑμᾶς οὐ μὴ ἀδικήσῃ	1	Here Jesus uses a double negative for emphasis, “nothing in no way will hurt you.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “something in some way might hurt you.” If your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
10:20	cs52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐν τούτῳ μὴ χαίρετε, ὅτι τὰ πνεύματα ὑμῖν ὑποτάσσεται, χαίρετε δὲ ὅτι τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Jesus is not actually telling the disciples not to rejoice over the way God has allowed them to deliver people who were oppressed by demons. Rather, he is exaggerating to emphasize that the disciples should rejoice even more that their names are written in heaven. Alternate translation: “rejoice that your names are written in heaven even more than you rejoice that the spirits submit to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
10:20	l594		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ πνεύματα ὑμῖν ὑποτάσσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the demons must obey you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:20	s4cj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has written down your names in heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:20	l595		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ὀνόματα ὑμῶν ἐνγέγραπται ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	While it may be literally true that there is a written record of names in heaven, you may wish to express the meaning and significance of this in your translation. Alternate translation: “God in heaven knows that you belong to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:21	l596		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	Here Luke uses the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a particular time. Alternate translation: “At that same time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:21	l597		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	ἐξομολογοῦμαί σοι, Πάτερ	1	Use your best judgment about whether the formal or informal form of **you** would be more natural in your language here. Jesus is speaking as an adult son would to a father with whom he had a close relationship. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
10:21	mf9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
10:21	rs3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	Κύριε τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καὶ τῆς γῆς	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech to describe something by naming its two components. Together **heaven** and **earth** represent everything that exists. Alternate translation: “you who rule over everything that exists” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
10:21	n6xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ταῦτα	1	Jesus is likely using this expression to refer to his identity as God’s Son and God’s identity as his Father. He describes these things in the next verse and says that only people to whom he reveals these identities can understand them, just as he says here that they are revealed only to certain people. Since the expression is explained in the next verse, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
10:21	l598		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **wise** and **intelligent** as nouns in order to indicate people who have those qualities. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who are wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
10:21	i2zf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	Because God had concealed the truth from these people, they actually were not wise and intelligent, even though they thought they were. Alternate translation: “people who think they are wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
10:21	l599		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	σοφῶν καὶ συνετῶν	1	The terms **wise** and **intelligent** mean similar things. Jesus uses the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “people who think they understand everything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
10:21	a175		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	νηπίοις	1	**Infants** refers figuratively to people who may not have much education, but who are willing to accept Jesus’ teachings in the same way that little children willingly listen to those they trust. You could explain the meaning of this metaphor in your translation, or you could translate it as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “people who trust my teachings implicitly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:21	nm6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	Jesus says **before you** to mean “where you could see” or “in your sight.” Sight, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in your judgment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:22	e47e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πάντα μοι παρεδόθη ὑπὸ τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “My Father has handed everything over to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
10:22	l600		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδεὶς γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς, εἰ μὴ ὁ Πατήρ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus is making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “only the Father knows who the Son is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
10:22	six4			γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς	1	Here, the Greek word translated **knows** means to know from personal experience. God the Father knows Jesus in this way. Alternate translation: “is acquainted with the Son” or “is acquainted with me”
10:22	xm3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	γινώσκει τίς ἐστιν ὁ Υἱὸς	1	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. Alternate translation: “knows who I am” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
10:22	fp68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱὸς & ὁ Πατήρ	1	These are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
10:22	rkt2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐδεὶς γινώσκει & τίς ἐστιν ὁ Πατὴρ, εἰ μὴ ὁ Υἱὸς	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus is making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause.

10:22	zg14			γινώσκει & τίς ἐστιν ὁ Πατὴρ	1	Here the Greek word translated **knows** means to know from personal experience. Jesus knows God his Father in this way. Alternate translation: “is acquainted with the Father” or “am acquainted with the Father”
10:22	evw3			ᾧ ἐὰν βούληται ὁ Υἱὸς ἀποκαλύψαι	1	Alternate translation: “whoever the Son wants to introduce the Father to” or (if you translated in the first person) “whoever I want to introduce the Father to”
10:23	yd5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ στραφεὶς πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς κατ’ ἰδίαν, εἶπεν	1	The implication is that a crowd was present when the 72 disciples returned to report to Jesus what they had done, and that this crowd heard what Jesus told them and what he prayed to God. But now Jesus is speaking only to the disciples in a way that the crowd will not be able to hear him. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said, in the direction of his disciples so that only they could hear him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:23	l601		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	μακάριοι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ βλέποντες ἃ βλέπετε	1	Jesus is using the term **eyes** to describe these disciples by reference to one part of them, the part they are using to witness the great works that reveal who he is. Alternate translation: “How good it is for you to see what you see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
10:23	mq23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μακάριοι οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ οἱ βλέποντες ἃ βλέπετε	1	The phrase **what you see** probably refers to the great works of healing and miracles that Jesus is doing, which reveal who he is. Alternate translation: “How good it is for you to see the things that I am doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:24	f32w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ οὐκ εἶδαν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why the prophets and kings did not see these things. Alternate translation: “but could not see them because they lived before this time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:24	q61s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἃ ἀκούετε	1	The phrase **what you hear** probably refers to the teachings of Jesus. Alternate translation: “the things that you have heard me say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:24	mb4b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ οὐκ ἤκουσαν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why the prophets and kings did not hear these things. Alternate translation: “but could not hear them because they lived before this time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:25	l602		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:25	klh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	νομικός τις	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a lawyer who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
10:25	l603		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	νομικός	1	See how you translated **lawyer** in [7:30](../07/30.md). Alternate translation: “an expert in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
10:25	l604		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἀνέστη	1	By standing up, this lawyer was indicating that he had a question to ask Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that this was the reason for his action. Alternate translation: “stood up to show that he wanted to ask a question” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
10:25	c6ac			ἐκπειράζων αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “to see how well he would answer”
10:25	l605			Διδάσκαλε	1	**Teacher** was a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
10:25	dh16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τί ποιήσας, ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω?	1	The lawyer is using the term **inherit** in a figurative sense to mean “come to possess” or “have.” Alternate translation: “what must I do in order to have everlasting life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:25	l606		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	τί ποιήσας, ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω?	1	This lawyer may be asking about a single deed that would be worthy of eternal life, because he uses a verb form that does not indicate continuing action. Alternate translation: “What one thing do I need to do so that God will give me eternal life?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
10:25	ls03		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τί ποιήσας, ζωὴν αἰώνιον κληρονομήσω	1	The lawyer means implicitly that he would **inherit** or “come to possess” this **everlasting life** from God. Alternate translation: “what must I do so that God will give me everlasting life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:26	nj77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται? πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	Jesus is using these questions to get this man to reflect on the Jewish law and apply it to his own question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement that incorporates both of Jesus’ questions. Alternate translation: “Tell me what Moses wrote about that in the law and how you understand it.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
10:26	l607		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται? πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus may be using repetition for emphasis and clarity. Both phrases have to do with what the law says. The first phrase views this objectively in terms of what is written there, and the second phrase views this subjectively from the perspective of a person reading it. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if your readers might wonder why Jesus was saying basically the same thing twice. Alternate translation: “Tell me what answer a person would find to your question in the law of Moses.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
10:26	m2nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ νόμῳ τί γέγραπται?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

10:26	a8nt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πῶς ἀναγινώσκεις?	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “What do you understand it to be saying?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:27	l608		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν	1	Together **answering** and **said** mean that the lawyer responded to the question that Jesus asked him. Alternate translation: “The lawyer responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
10:27	l609		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	ἀγαπήσεις	1	Here it may not be clear whether to use the singular or plural form of **you** because this is a short quotation from the Scriptures and the context is not given. The word is actually singular because, even though Moses said this to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey this command. So in your translation, use the singular forms of **you** **your**, and **yourself** in this verse, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
10:27	hxk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1	The Scriptures are using a statement to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])

Alternate translation: “with your entire being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
10:27	l610		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξ ὅλης καρδίας σου, καὶ ἐν ὅλῃ τῇ ψυχῇ σου	1	The words **heart** and **soul** figuratively represent a person’s inner being. If you do not translate all four of the terms here with a single phrase, you could represent these two together. Alternate translation: “with all of your inner self” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:27	k1el		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ, τὸν πλησίον σου ὡς σεαυτόν	1	The lawyer is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation (filling in ellipsis): “and you must also love your neighbor as much as you love yourself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
10:28	l611		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	τοῦτο ποίει, καὶ ζήσῃ	1	Jesus is describing a conditional situation.

10:29	lr4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τίς ἐστίν μου πλησίον?	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the reason why the lawyer asked this specific question. Alternate translation: “whom should I consider to be my neighbor, that is, someone I need to love as I love myself?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:30	l612		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Together **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the question that the lawyer asked him. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
10:30	bh6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ὑπολαβὼν δὲ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Jesus answers the man’s question by telling a brief story that provides an illustration. Alternate translation: “As an answer to the man’s question, Jesus told him this story” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
10:30	e1lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις	1	This introduces a new character in the parable. Alternate translation: “There was a man who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

10:30	v2ms		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	λῃσταῖς περιέπεσεν	1	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that this does not mean that the man fell down accidentally. Rather, this is an idiom. Alternate translation: “some robbers attacked him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:30	heb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκδύσαντες αὐτὸν	1	Alternate translation: “after they had taken everything he had” or “after they had stolen of all his things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
10:30	l615		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καὶ πληγὰς ἐπιθέντες	1	This expression means that the robbers also beat this man. Alternate translation: “and beaten him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

10:31	i3sf			κατὰ συνκυρίαν	1	This expression means that this event was not anything that anyone had planned. Alternate translation: “it just so happened that”
10:31	plr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἱερεύς τις	1	This expression introduces a new character in the parable. Alternate translation: “there was a priest who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
10:31	l616		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἱερεύς τις	1	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that a priest is a religious leader. This detail is important to the story.

10:31	gh79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ ἰδὼν αὐτὸν	1	Since a priest is a religious leader, the audience would assume that he would help the injured man. Since he did not, this phrase could be introduced with a contrasting word to call attention to this unexpected result.

10:31	xiu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀντιπαρῆλθεν	1	The implication is that the priest did not help the man. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he did not help him, but instead walked past him on the other side of the road” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Since he did not, this phrase could be introduced with a contrasting word to call attention to this unexpected result. Alternate translation: “likewise a Levite also came to the place, but when he saw him, he walked past him on the other side of the road” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
10:32	l619		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀντιπαρῆλθεν	1	The implication is that the Levite did not help the man. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly.

Since he did help him, Jesus introduces this character with a contrasting word that calls attention to this unexpected result. you could do the same in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
10:33	w8qm			ἐσπλαγχνίσθη	1	Alternate translation: “he felt sorry for him and wanted to help him”

10:34	ktz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ ἴδιον κτῆνος	1	The Greek term translated as **animal** refers to an animal that carried heavy loads.

10:37	ig9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πορεύου καὶ σὺ ποίει ὁμοίως	1	The implication is that the lawyer has given the correct answer.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

Alternate translation: “it seems as if you do not care that my sister has left me alone to serve.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
10:41	l628		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῇ ὁ Κύριος	1	Together **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to Martha’s request. Alternate translation: “But the Lord replied to her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate them with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “you are worrying too much about things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
10:41	l631		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	θορυβάζῃ περὶ πολλά	1	If you do not combine the term for **troubled** with the word **anxious** into a single phrase, you could state **are … troubled** with an active form.

10:42	hqt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἑνός δέ ἐστιν χρεία	1	Jesus says **one thing** as an overstatement for emphasis.

10:42	l632		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑνός δέ ἐστιν χρεία	1	The implication is that this most important thing is what Jesus is teaching about God, and that Martha should have been concentrating on that.

10:42	l633			Μαριὰμ & τὴν ἀγαθὴν μερίδα ἐξελέξατο	1	While Jesus spoke just earlier about “one thing” as opposed to “many things,” here he seems to contrast only two things, **the good part** with another part, perhaps not “the bad part,” but at least the part that is not to be preferred. This likely refers to the two activities that Mary and Martha have chosen to pursue while Jesus is present in their home. Alternate translation: “Mary has chosen the better activity”
10:42	nzn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἥτις οὐκ ἀφαιρεθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτῆς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. This could mean: (1) “I will not take that opportunity away from her.” (2) “God will not let her lose what she has gained from listening to me.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
11:intro	j6le				0	# Luke 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches about prayer (11:1-13)\n2. Jesus teaches about driving out demons and other subjects (11:14-36)\n3. Jesus criticizes the Pharisees and experts in the law (11:37-54)\n\nULT sets the lines in 11:2-4 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a special prayer.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The Lord’s Prayer\n\nWhen Jesus’ followers asked him to teach them how to pray, he taught them this prayer. He did not expect them to use the same words every time they prayed, but he did want them to know what God wanted them to pray about.\n\n### Jonah\n\nJonah was an Old Testament prophet whom God sent to the Gentile city of Nineveh to tell the people there to repent. When he went and preached to them, they did repent. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, that is, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. The Bible speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, that is, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### Washing\n\nThe Pharisees would wash themselves and the things they ate with. They would even wash things that were not dirty. The law of Moses did not tell them to wash those things, but they would wash them anyway. They did that because they thought that if they obeyed both the rules that God had made and some rules that their ancestors had added, God would think that they were better people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### Bread and stone, fish and snake\n\nIn 11:11, some ancient manuscripts have a longer reading, which also is found in Matthew 7:9. It says, “Which father among you, if your son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or a fish, will give him a snake?” ULT uses the shorter reading, which mentions just the fish and snake. This shorter reading is well attested to in many other ancient manuscripts. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
11:1	fl3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

11:2	l636		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	Jesus is not saying that God’s **name** is not already **holy** in itself. Rather, he is referring to how people consider God’s **name**. Alternate translation: “may people treat your name as holy” or “may people regard your name as holy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:2	l637		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action.

11:2	b6sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἁγιασθήτω τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	The term **name** is a figurative way of referring to an entire person by reference to something associated with them. Alternate translation: “may all people honor you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
11:2	tm1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” As the General Introduction to Luke explains, in one sense, the **kingdom** of God is already present on earth, while in another sense, it is still a future reality. Try to translate this in a way that acknowledges both aspects. Alternate translation: “Come and rule more and more throughout the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
11:2	l638		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	σου	1	Here, **your** is singular because Jesus is teaching his disciples how to pray to God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form for **your** in its two instances here and for **you** in [11:4](../11/04.md). Alternatively, it might be more appropriate in your culture to address God using a familiar form, such as friends would use with one another. Use your best judgment about what form to use. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
11:3	q89w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	δίδου ἡμῖν	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
11:3	l639		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	δίδου ἡμῖν	1	Jesus teaches his disciples to speak to God in the plural because he wants them to pray together in community about the matters he describes. Since the word **us** would refer to the people praying, but not to God, it would be exclusive, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
11:3	s6qp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον	1	Jesus refers figuratively to **bread**, one common food, to mean food in general. Alternate translation: “the food we need that day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
11:4	iid7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἄφες ἡμῖν & μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς	1	These are imperatives, but they should be translated as polite requests rather than as commands. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” in each case to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please forgive us … please do not lead us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
11:4	wi99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παντὶ ὀφείλοντι ἡμῖν	1	Jesus uses the image of being in debt figuratively to describe having sinned against a person. Alternate translation: “everyone who has sinned against us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:4	db55			μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν	1	You could state this in a positive form. Alternate translation: “please lead us away from temptation”
11:5	l640		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἕξει φίλον, καὶ πορεύσεται πρὸς αὐτὸν μεσονυκτίου	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach his disciples. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you went to the house of a friend in the middle of the night” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
11:5	l641		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ εἴπῃ αὐτῷ, φίλε, χρῆσόν μοι τρεῖς ἄρτους	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and asked his friend to let him borrow three loaves of bread” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
11:5	y1s9			χρῆσόν μοι τρεῖς ἄρτους	1	Alternate translation: “let me borrow three loaves of bread” or “give me three loaves of bread, and I will pay you back later”
11:6	l642		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐπειδὴ φίλος μου παρεγένετο ἐξ ὁδοῦ πρός με, καὶ οὐκ ἔχω ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing the sentence from the previous verse): “explaining that another friend has just arrived on a journey and that he does not have enough food to feed him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
11:6	l643		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπειδὴ	1	The speaker uses this word to introduce the reason why he is making this request at this time. If you translate this as a direct quotation, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you why I am asking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
11:6	zl5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	παρεγένετο ἐξ ὁδοῦ πρός με	1	The speaker uses the term **road** figuratively to describe being on a journey. Alternate translation: “another friend of mine is on a journey and has just arrived at my house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
11:6	zp7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	It is unlikely that the speaker has no food at all in his house that he could serve his friend. Rather, this is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “enough food to feed him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
11:6	l731		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ παραθήσω αὐτῷ	1	This could mean: (1) as UST implies, while his family has the ingredients to make a meal, they do not want to make a weary traveler wait the time it would take for them to bake bread and prepare other food. Alternate translation: “any food prepared to feed him” (2) the speaker wants to extend hospitality by sharing a meal with his guest, and so he needs enough food for a family meal. Alternate translation: “enough food to share a meal with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:7	l644		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἴπῃ	1	The word **answering** indicates that what this friend **may say** would be a response. Alternate translation: “he may reply” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
11:7	l645		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἴπῃ, μή μοι κόπους πάρεχε; ἤδη ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται, καὶ τὰ παιδία μου μετ’ ἐμοῦ εἰς τὴν κοίτην εἰσίν; οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστὰς δοῦναί σοι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he may tell you not to bother him, because he has already locked the door for the night and his children are in bed with him, so he cannot get up and give you anything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
11:7	l646		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤδη ἡ θύρα κέκλεισται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “We have already closed and locked the door” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
11:7	vhf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐ δύναμαι ἀναστὰς	1	The friend inside is not literally incapable of getting up. Rather, this is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “It would be very difficult for me to get up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
11:8	zl2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Even though Jesus began this hypothetical situation by asking “which of you,” that is, “which one of you,” here he is addressing all of the disciples together, not the hypothetical single disciple who might go to a friend’s house at midnight. So here, the word **you** is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
11:8	prx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διά γε τὴν ἀναίδειαν αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **persistence** with a verb such as “continue.” Alternate translation: “because you continue to ask him urgently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
11:8	l647			ἐγερθεὶς	1	Alternate translation: “getting out of bed”
11:9	j4ef		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν λέγω & ὑμῖν & εὑρήσετε & ὑμῖν	1	In the first instance in this verse, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the disciples. In the next three instances, even though Jesus is describing what could be an individual situation of a person praying to God, **you** is also plural because Jesus is still speaking to the disciples as a group. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
11:9	l648		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αἰτεῖτε & ζητεῖτε	1	It might be customary in your language to say what a person would be asking for and seeking, and from whom. Alternate translation: “keep asking God for what you need … keep seeking what you need from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:9	i7j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δοθήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will give it to you” or “you will receive it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
11:9	l1f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κρούετε	1	To **knock** at a door means to hit it a few times to let a person inside the house know you are standing outside. You could translate this expression with the way people in your culture show that they have arrived at a house, such as “call out” or “cough” or “clap.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:9	l649		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κρούετε	1	Jesus is using the expression **knock** figuratively to mean getting someone’s attention. Alternate translation: “seek God’s attention in prayer” or “let God know you are depending on him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:9	kp3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will open the door for you” or “God will welcome you inside” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
11:9	l650		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνοιγήσεται ὑμῖν	1	This phrase continues the metaphor of prayer as knocking on a door. Alternate translation: “God will give you what you need” or “God will enable you to do what you are praying about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:10	l651		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ κρούοντι	1	See how you translated the word “knock” in [11:9](../11/09.md). Alternate translation: “to the one who calls out” or “to the one who coughs” or “to the one who claps” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:10	l652		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀνοιγήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

11:10	l653		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνοιγήσεται	1	This phrase continues the metaphor of prayer as knocking on a door. Alternate translation: “God will give you what you need” or “God will enable you to do what you are praying about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:11	l654		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	τίνα δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν τὸν πατέρα αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς ἰχθύν, καὶ ἀντὶ ἰχθύος, ὄφιν αὐτῷ ἐπιδώσει?	1	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to use this reading or a longer one that is found in some ancient manuscripts.

11:11	q63d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνα δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν τὸν πατέρα αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς ἰχθύν, καὶ ἀντὶ ἰχθύος, ὄφιν αὐτῷ ἐπιδώσει?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation.

11:11	l656		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	τίνα δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν τὸν πατέρα αἰτήσει ὁ υἱὸς ἰχθύν, καὶ ἀντὶ ἰχθύος, ὄφιν αὐτῷ ἐπιδώσει?	1	Jesus is also using a hypothetical situation to teach, and you could translate his words that way. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you had a son who asked for a fish to eat. None of you fathers would give him a snake instead.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
11:11	ls04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὄφιν	1	In this culture, people did not eat snakes. So Jesus is saying that a father would not give a son something the son could not eat if the son asked for something that he could eat. If people do eat snakes in your culture, you could use the name of something that they do not eat, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something he cannot eat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:12	l657		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἢ καὶ αἰτήσει ᾠόν, ἐπιδώσει αὐτῷ σκορπίον	1	Jesus is speaking in an abbreviated way. Alternate translation: “Or if a son asked for an egg, would his father give him a scorpion” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

Alternate translation: “Or suppose a son asked for an egg to eat. His father would not give him a scorpion instead.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
11:12	e8hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σκορπίον	1	A **scorpion** is a small animal related to the spider. It has two claws and a poisonous stinger in its tail. If your readers would not be familiar with scorpions, you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “a poisonous stinging animal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:12	ls05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σκορπίον	1	In this culture, people did not eat scorpions. So Jesus is saying that a father would not give a son something the son could not eat if the son asked for something that he could eat. If people do eat scorpions in your culture, you could use the name of something that they do not eat, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something he cannot eat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:13	g99r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ & ὑμεῖς πονηροὶ ὑπάρχοντες, οἴδατε	1	Jesus is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Jesus is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since you who are evil know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
11:13	aww7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πόσῳ μᾶλλον ὁ Πατὴρ ὁ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, δώσει Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον τοῖς αἰτοῦσιν αὐτόν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples.

Alternate translation: “your Heavenly Father will even more certainly give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
11:14	uyu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to begin relating a new event by introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens.

11:14	afa8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἦν ἐκβάλλων δαιμόνιον κωφόν	1	The **demon** itself was not unable to speak. Rather, it was preventing the man whom it was controlling from speaking.

11:14	l6cg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to mark where the action begins that this episode centers around. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
11:14	p72b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τοῦ δαιμονίου ἐξελθόντος	1	Luke is relating this episode briefly, and he does not say from whom the demon **had gone out**. Your language may require you to say that. Alternate translation: “when the demon had gone out of the man” or “once the demon had left the man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
11:14	tnq3			ἐλάλησεν ὁ κωφός	1	Alternate translation: “the man who had been unable to speak then spoke”

Alternate translation: “demanding that he ask God to do a miracle” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
11:16	x9fw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σημεῖον ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐζήτουν παρ’ αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that the people who were challenging Jesus wanted him to ask God for a miracle to prove that his authority came from God. Alternate translation: “by demanding that he ask God to do a miracle to show that God had given him his authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:17	l661		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πᾶσα βασιλεία ἐφ’ ἑαυτὴν διαμερισθεῖσα ἐρημοῦται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active verbs to express the ideas behind the two passive verb forms **divided** and **is made desolate**. Alternate translation: “If the people of a kingdom fight among themselves, they will destroy their own kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
11:17	e36g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	βασιλεία	1	Jesus uses the term **kingdom** to refer figuratively to the people who live in it. Alternate translation: “the people of a kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

11:18	vnt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι λέγετε, ἐν Βεελζεβοὺλ ἐκβάλλειν με τὰ δαιμόνια	1	The implication is that if Jesus is doing this, then Satan’s kingdom is divided against itself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may also be helpful to say who people considered Beelzebul to be. Alternate translation: “You are saying that I make demons leave people by using the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If I am making demons leave people by using the power of Beelzebul, then your followers must be using that same power. But you do not believe that is true about them.

In the same way, be careful not to think that you understand and live by God’s message if you really do not” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
11:36	g336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἔσται φωτεινὸν ὅλον, ὡς ὅταν ὁ λύχνος τῇ ἀστραπῇ φωτίζῃ σε	1	Jesus now uses a simile to connect the illustration of the lamp with the extended metaphor of the eye. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of the simile. Alternate translation: “light will come into your whole body. In the same way, if you are willing to obey God, you will be able to understand his message and live by it completely, just as a lamp shines a bright light that allows you to see yourself and everything around you clearly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
11:37	h6zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν δὲ τῷ λαλῆσαι	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “and when Jesus had finished saying these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
11:37	l702			ἐρωτᾷ αὐτὸν Φαρισαῖος	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee asked him”
11:37	l703		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Φαρισαῖος	1	This introduces a new character into the story. Alternate translation: “a Pharisee who was there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
11:37	x6nx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνέπεσεν	1	It was the custom in this culture at a relaxed meal such as this one for host and guests to eat while lying down comfortably around the table. You could translate this by using the expression in your language for the customary posture at a meal. Alternate translation: “sat down at the table” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:38	bm8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ πρῶτον ἐβαπτίσθη	1	The Pharisees had a rule that people had to **wash** their hands before eating in order to be ceremonially clean before God. Alternate translation: “wash his hands in order to be ceremonially clean” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:39	l704			ὁ Κύριος	1	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the respectful title **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
11:39	xf4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς οἱ Φαρισαῖοι τὸ ἔξωθεν τοῦ ποτηρίου καὶ τοῦ πίνακος καθαρίζετε, τὸ δὲ ἔσωθεν ὑμῶν γέμει ἁρπαγῆς καὶ πονηρίας	1	It becomes clear from the second part of this sentence that Jesus is using the cup and the bowl figuratively in the first part to represent the Pharisees. Alternate translation: “You Pharisees are careful to maintain good appearances on the outside, but your true character is that you are greedy and wicked people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:39	zkq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς & τὸ ἔξωθεν τοῦ ποτηρίου καὶ τοῦ πίνακος καθαρίζετε	1	Washing of the outside of containers was a part of the ritual practices of the Pharisees.

11:39	b8gj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ δὲ ἔσωθεν ὑμῶν γέμει ἁρπαγῆς καὶ πονηρίας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **greed** and **evil** with adjectives, as UST does. Alternate translation: “but your true character is that you are greedy and wicked people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
11:40	zq4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄφρονες	1	Jesus is using an adjective as a noun. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “You foolish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
11:40	g39h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχ ὁ ποιήσας τὸ ἔξωθεν, καὶ τὸ ἔσωθεν ἐποίησεν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to challenge and correct the Pharisees. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “The one who made the outside also made the inside!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
11:41	m3ww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ἐνόντα δότε ἐλεημοσύνην	1	Jesus assumes that the Pharisees will know that he is now referring literally to the cups and bowls because he wants to speak about what they contain. So in this saying, they no longer represent the Pharisees figuratively. Alternate translation: “give to the poor what is in your cups and bowls” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:41	l705		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ ἐνόντα δότε ἐλεημοσύνην	1	Jesus is referring to food by association with the cups and bowls that the food is **inside**. Alternate translation: “share your food with the poor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
11:41	l706		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get the Pharisees to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:41	phz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντα καθαρὰ ὑμῖν ἐστιν	1	The implication is that if the Pharisees devote themselves to what is most important, helping people in need, then they will recognize that ceremonial cleansing is less important and less worthy of their attention. Alternate translation: “you will not have to be so concerned about ritually washing cups and bowls” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:42	ans4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποδεκατοῦτε τὸ ἡδύοσμον, καὶ τὸ πήγανον, καὶ πᾶν λάχανον	1	The implication is that the Pharisees are counting the leaves on their garden herbs and giving a tenth of those to God, and that by doing that, they are going to almost absurd extremes in pursuing that devotional practice. Alternate translation: “you are so extreme that you give every tenth leaf from your mint and rue and other garden plants to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:42	p71g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ ἡδύοσμον, καὶ τὸ πήγανον	1	These are the names of herbs. People put just a little bit of their leaves into their food to give it flavor. If your readers would not know what **mint** and **rue** are, you could use the name of herbs that they would know. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:42	l25z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶν λάχανον	1	This does not mean every **herb** that exists, but every **herb** that the Pharisees were growing in their gardens. Alternate translation: “every other herb in your gardens” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
11:42	yk7d			τὴν ἀγάπην τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “to make sure that people are treated fairly and compassionately, as God would want”
11:42	l707			ταῦτα & κἀκεῖνα	1	By **these things**, Jesus means the justice and the love of God. By **those things**, he means devotional practices such as tithing. Your language may have its own way of expressing distinctions like this. Alternate translation: “the latter, and … the former”
11:42	myv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	κἀκεῖνα μὴ παρεῖναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this double negative, which consists of a negative particle and a negative verb, as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “while making sure to express your devotion to God as well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
11:43	w6pv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὴν πρωτοκαθεδρίαν	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “the best seats” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
11:43	sz72		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς ἀσπασμοὺς	1	The implication is that people would greet the Pharisees in public by addressing them with honorary titles. Alternate translation: “for people to greet you with special titles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:44	hag2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἐστὲ ὡς τὰ μνημεῖα τὰ ἄδηλα, καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ περιπατοῦντες ἐπάνω οὐκ οἴδασιν	1	Jesus is saying that the Pharisees are like unmarked graves because they appear to be ceremonially clean, and so people do not realize that they should avoid them and their teaching. Alternate translation: “you are like burial places that people should not go near, but people do not realize that because the places are unmarked” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
11:44	l708		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐστὲ ὡς τὰ μνημεῖα τὰ ἄδηλα	1	The implication is that these **graves** are **unseen**, that is, people do not know that they are there, because they do not have markers such as the stones or plaques that are customarily used to identify graves and to memorialize the people who are buried in them. Alternate translation: “you are like unmarked graves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:44	mrw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μνημεῖα	1	The term **graves** refers to holes dug in the ground where dead bodies are buried. If your readers would not be familiar with **graves**, you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “burial places” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:44	l709		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	καὶ οἱ ἄνθρωποι οἱ περιπατοῦντες ἐπάνω	1	Here Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “that people walk over” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
11:44	h9x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ οἴδασιν	1	The implication is that if the Jews walked over a grave, they would become ceremonially unclean because they had come close to a dead body. Unmarked graves would cause them to do that accidentally. Alternate translation: “do not realize that and so become ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:44	l710		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ οἴδασιν	1	Jesus is using the implied ceremonial uncleanness figuratively to represent not doing what pleases God. He has just said in [11:42](../11/42.md) that this is really a matter of showing love and justice to others. Alternate translation: “without realizing it and so, because they follow your teaching, they do not do the things that God wants them to do most” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:45	l711			ἀποκριθεὶς δέ τις τῶν νομικῶν λέγει αὐτῷ	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “Then one of the experts in the Jewish law who was there said to him”
11:45	l712		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς & λέγει	1	Together the two verbs **answering** and **says** mean that this lawyer was responding to what Jesus had said about the Pharisees. Alternate translation: “responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
11:45	u1vv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	τις τῶν νομικῶν	1	This phrase introduces a new character into the story. Alternate translation: “one of the experts in the Jewish law who was there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
11:45	l713		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τις τῶν νομικῶν	1	See how you translated “lawyer” in [7:30](../07/30.md). Alternate translation: “one of the experts in the Jewish law who was there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:45	l714			Διδάσκαλε	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
11:45	v1pr			ταῦτα λέγων, καὶ ἡμᾶς ὑβρίζεις	1	Alternate translation: “those are not very nice things to say, and they apply to us too”
11:46	wx9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὑμῖν τοῖς νομικοῖς οὐαί	1	The implication is that Jesus did intend to condemn the actions of the experts in the law along with the actions of the Pharisees. Alternate translation: “God is just as displeased with you experts in the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:46	l715		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῖς νομικοῖς	1	See how you translated **lawyers** in [11:45](../11/45.md). Alternate translation: “experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:46	v2vl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φορτίζετε τοὺς ἀνθρώπους φορτία δυσβάστακτα	1	Jesus is figuratively describing the many rules that these experts give people as burdens that are too heavy to carry. Alternate translation: “you give people more rules than they can possibly follow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:46	l716		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀνθρώπους	1	Here Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
11:46	mws4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	αὐτοὶ ἑνὶ τῶν δακτύλων ὑμῶν οὐ προσψαύετε τοῖς φορτίοις	1	Jesus uses the least possible thing someone could do to help someone else carry a burden, lifting part of it with a single finger, to emphasize how little these experts are actually doing to help people follow the law of Moses. Alternate translation: “you are not doing anything at all to help people truly obey the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
11:47	l717		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πατέρες	1	Jesus is using the term **fathers** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
11:48	drs1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μαρτυρεῖτε καὶ συνευδοκεῖτε τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν	1	The implication is that the Pharisees and experts in the law are not really honoring the prophets whom their ancestors killed when they build elaborate tombs for them. Rather, their ancestors began the job by actually killing them, and now they are finishing the job by burying them. Alternate translation: “you show that you approve of and agree with what your ancestors did when you bury the prophets to finish the job of killing them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:48	l718		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν	1	Jesus is using the term **fathers** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “your ancestors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
11:48	l719		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς & οἰκοδομεῖτε	1	The implication is that the Pharisees and law experts are building tombs for the prophets, as [11:47](../11/47.md) says explicitly. Alternate translation: “you are building tombs for them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:49	by5w			διὰ τοῦτο	1	The expression **Because of this** refers to the way that the current generation was effectively continuing the actions of its ancestors, who had killed the prophets. Alternate translation: “Because you are just as hostile to the prophets as your ancestors were”
11:49	c97g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ σοφία τοῦ Θεοῦ εἶπεν	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of God’s **wisdom** as if it were able to speak by itself. Alternate translation: “God in his wisdom said” or “God wisely said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
11:49	lda4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποστελῶ εἰς αὐτοὺς προφήτας καὶ ἀποστόλους, καὶ ἐξ αὐτῶν ἀποκτενοῦσιν καὶ διώξουσιν	1	Jesus is saying that God was not so foolish or naïve as to think that the Israelites would welcome the message of the prophets and apostles. God in his wisdom knew that they would oppose his messengers. But he sent them anyway, because their message was necessary and important. Alternate translation: “I am going to send prophets and apostles to them with my message, even though I know they will persecute and kill some of them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:49	w1fh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκτενοῦσιν καὶ διώξουσιν	1	Here, Jesus may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **persecute** may be telling why and how the people would **kill** the prophets. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “persecute even to the point of killing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
11:50	pi6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵνα ἐκζητηθῇ τὸ αἷμα πάντων τῶν προφητῶν, τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου, ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	The implication seems to be that God will also send prophets to the people living at this time because the people’s violent persecution of the prophets will constitute a conscious, deliberate rejection of God’s message that will provide grounds for definitive judgment. That is because the people of this time should know better than to persecute the prophets, based on the prominent bad example of their own ancestors. Alternate translation: “so that the people living at this time, who should have known better, can be held accountable for the blood that people have shed of all the prophets since the beginning of the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
11:50	l720		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἵνα ἐκζητηθῇ & ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

11:50	d1rf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ αἷμα & τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον	1	Jesus uses the term **the blood … that has been shed** to refer to the deaths of **the prophets** figuratively by association with their **blood.** Alternate translation: “the deaths” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
11:50	l722			ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου	1	Alternate translation: “since the beginning of the world” or “since God made the world”

11:51	l724		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	αἵματος Ἂβελ & αἵματος Ζαχαρίου	1	Jesus uses the terms **the blood of Abel … the blood of Zechariah** to refer to the deaths of these men figuratively by association with the shedding of their blood. Alternate translation: “the death of Abel … the death of Zechariah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
11:51	l725		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἂβελ	1	**Abel** is the name of a man. He was the son of Adam, the first man, and God commended him for doing what was right. His brother Cain murdered him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
11:51	jes7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ζαχαρίου	1	**Zechariah** is the name of a man. It is not the same man as father of John the Baptist, whose story Luke tells at the beginning of this book. Rather, Jesus means the priest whom King Joash ordered the officials of Judah to stone to death in the temple courtyard after he rebuked the people of Judah for worshipping idols. See [2 Chronicles 24:21](../2ch/24/21.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
11:51	l726		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ οἴκου	1	Jesus figuratively calls the temple the **house**, meaning the “house of God,” since God’s presence was in the temple. Alternate translation: “the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:51	l727		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκζητηθήσεται ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς ταύτης	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

11:52	vj5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῖς νομικοῖς	1	See how you translated **lawyers** in [11:45](../11/45.md). Alternate translation: “experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:52	s4fc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἤρατε τὴν κλεῖδα τῆς γνώσεως	1	Jesus speaks figuratively about the **knowledge** of God’s truth as if it were in a building whose door was locked, and about proper teaching as if it were a **key** that could unlock that door. Alternate translation: “you prevent people from knowing God’s truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:52	xg48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν κλεῖδα	1	A **key** is a small metal device that opens a lock that is used to keep things like a door, a box, or a drawer closed. If your readers would not know what a **key** is, you could use the name of a comparable device in your culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
11:52	fj7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτοὶ οὐκ εἰσήλθατε, καὶ τοὺς εἰσερχομένους ἐκωλύσατε	1	Jesus continues the metaphor by saying figuratively that these experts in the law have not gone into the building where they could learn God’s truth, and they have not given others the **key** that would allow them to unlock the door and go inside to learn. Alternate translation: “you do not know God’s truth yourselves, and you are preventing others from knowing it as well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:53	mld3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	κἀκεῖθεν ἐξελθόντος αὐτοῦ	1	In this verse and the next verse, Luke comments on what happened as a result of the episode he has just related. Alternate translation: “After Jesus left the Pharisee’s house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
11:54	mr32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνεδρεύοντες αὐτὸν θηρεῦσαί τι ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	Luke speaks figuratively of the scribes and Pharisees trying to find grounds to accuse Jesus as if they were hunters hiding behind cover in order to catch an animal. Luke then speaks figuratively of what Jesus was saying as if it were the animal that these hunters were trying to catch. Alternate translation: “listening carefully to Jesus to see if they could use something he said to accuse him of teaching the wrong things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:54	l729		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τι ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	Luke figuratively describes what Jesus was saying by association with his **mouth**, by which he spoke these things. Alternate translation: “something he said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
12:intro	jun3				0	# Luke 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches about trusting and honoring God (12:1-12)\n2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who trusted in money (12:13-21)\n3. Jesus teaches not to trust in money (12:22-34)\n4. Jesus teaches about being ready for his return (12:35-59)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit”\n\nJesus says in 12:10 that anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. This is a descriptive statement, not a prescriptive one. Jesus is not saying that if people happen to speak certain words, then God will refuse to forgive them, no matter how sorry they are afterwards. Rather, it is the Holy Spirit who brings conviction of sin and of the need to repent. “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” means attributing the influence of the Holy Spirit to evil powers, as the Pharisees did when they said in 11:15 that Jesus drove out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons. By definition, then, if a person thinks that the influence of the Holy Spirit is an evil influence, they will not respond to it, and so they will not experience conviction of sin, repent, and be forgiven. That is why people who “blaspheme against the Holy Spirit” will not be forgiven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n### Servants\n\nGod expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not. Jesus teaches about this in 12:34-40.\n\n### Division\n\nJesus knew that those who did not choose to follow him would hate those who did choose to follow him. He also knew that most people love their families more than they love anyone else. So he wanted his followers to understand that following and pleasing him had to be more important to them than having their family love them. Jesus teaches about this in 12:49-53.
12:1	en8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν οἷς	1	Luke uses these words to mark the beginning of a new event. This phrase seems to refer back to [11:54](../11/54.md).

Alternate translation: “while tens of thousands of the common people were gathering” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
12:1	l730		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μυριάδων	1	The word **myriads** is the plural of the Greek word “myriad,” which means ten thousand (10,000).

12:1	l736		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ζύμης	1	**Yeast** is a substance that causes fermentation and expansion within a batch of dough or batter.

12:2	e5w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οὐδὲν & συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν, ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Jesus uses them together to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine them, especially if including both phrases might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “people will learn about everything that others try to hide” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
12:2	l737		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν & συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν, ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement.

12:2	g46e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν & συνκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν, ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active verbal forms in place of the two passive forms here, and you could state who will do the action.

12:2	l738		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

12:2	l739		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	Supplying **nothing** from earlier in the sentence shows that this is a double negative.

12:3	rmx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων	1	Houses in Israel had flat roofs that were reached by stairs or ladders, so people could easily go up and stand on top of them.

12:5	ric8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Γέενναν	1	Jesus figuratively uses the name of this place, where refuse was thrown and fires burned continually, to mean hell. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

12:6	czr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ πέντε στρουθία πωλοῦνται ἀσσαρίων δύο?	1	Jesus is using this question to teach the disciples. He is not asking them to verify the market price for sparrows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You know that five sparrows are sold for only two small copper coins.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:6	u697		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	στρουθία	1	**Sparrows** are small, seed-eating birds. If your readers would not know what **sparrows** are, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “small birds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:6	l746		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ἀσσαρίων δύο	1	The word **assaria** is the plural of “assarion.” An assarion was a small copper coin equivalent to about half an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “two small copper coins” or “half an hour’s wages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
12:6	mru1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form.

12:6	l748		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐκ ἔστιν ἐπιλελησμένον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The expression **before God** means “in front of God,” that is, “where God can see.” Sight, in turn, figuratively represents attention. Alternate translation: “God is always aware of every one of them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:7	m833		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ αἱ τρίχες τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν πᾶσαι ἠρίθμηνται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action.

12:7	l749		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	καὶ αἱ τρίχες τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν πᾶσαι ἠρίθμηνται	1	Jesus is figuratively using one small part of a person, the **hairs** on the **head**, to indicate the entire person. Alternate translation: “God is aware of everything about you, right down to the smallest detail” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
12:7	l750		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	τῆς κεφαλῆς ὑμῶν	1	Although **head** is singular because Jesus is describing an individual situation, **your** is plural because he is speaking to his disciples as a group. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
12:7	l751			ἠρίθμηνται	1	This word can also mean “counted.” Jesus is not necessarily saying that God has assigned a number to each individual hair on a person’s head. Alternate translation: “counted”
12:7	shk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ φοβεῖσθε, πολλῶν στρουθίων διαφέρετε	1	The implication is that if God is aware of and concerned for sparrows, which are of less value, then God is certainly aware of and concerned for people, who are of greater value. And so followers of Jesus do not need to be afraid, since God is watching over them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are more valuable than many sparrows, so God is certainly even more aware of you and concerned for you, and so you do not need to be afraid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:8	xzh3			λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν	1	Jesus readdresses his disciples to mark a shift in his speech to a new topic, confession. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you”

12:8	l754		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

12:9	l757		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Here, Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
12:9	x27t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπαρνηθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will would do the action.

12:10	l759		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus is referring to himself in the third person.

Alternate translation: “to be tried by local Jewish tribunals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
12:11	gm94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τὰς ἀρχὰς, καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας	1	These two terms mean similar things. Jesus may be using them together for emphasis.

12:14	l765		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ὑμᾶς	1	The term **you** refers to the man and his brother. It would be in the dual form if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

12:20	l773			ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ, τὴν ψυχήν σου ἀπαιτοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ	1	This is an indefinite construction, such as many languages use, but God is the actual subject. Alternate translation: “I am demanding your soul from you this very night”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he said to his disciples, as the crowd was listening” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

12:25	l778		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πῆχυν	1	The implication may be that since a **cubit** is a relatively short distance, it figuratively represents only a short time. Alternate translation: “even a little bit” or “even a short time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

12:26	l780		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν λοιπῶν	1	The implication in context is that Jesus is referring to having food to eat and clothes to wear.

12:27	s8d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὰ κρίνα	1	The word **lilies** describes beautiful flowers that grow wild in the fields.

12:27	u3mf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐδὲ νήθει	1	In this context, to **spin** means to make thread or yarn for cloth.

If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since God makes the wild plants so beautiful, even though they are alive today and are thrown into the oven tomorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])

12:30	g8jy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τοῦ κόσμου	1	The term **nations** means non-Jewish people groups. The term **all** is not a generalization for emphasis.

12:33	xb63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βαλλάντια μὴ παλαιούμενα	1	If you would like to reproduce the figure of speech that Jesus uses, but you think your readers might not know what **purses** are, you could explain that term, or you could use the name of a different container that people in your culture use to keep valuable things safe.

12:41	l808		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	By **us**, Peter means “me and the rest of your disciples” but not Jesus himself. So **us** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

12:42	l811		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃν καταστήσει ὁ Κύριος ἐπὶ τῆς θεραπείας αὐτοῦ	1	The implication, as the rest of the parable makes clear, is that the master is making this arrangement temporarily and provisionally because he is going to be absent for a time. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “will put in charge of his other servants while he goes away for a while” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:43	g6xl			μακάριος ὁ δοῦλος ἐκεῖνος	1	Alternate translation: “How good it will be for that servant”

12:46	l814		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἥξει ὁ κύριος τοῦ δούλου ἐκείνου	1	If you translated the previous verse as a hypothetical condition, you could translate this verse as the result of that condition. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Then the master of that servant will arrive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
12:46	j1m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ, καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using the repetition to emphasize that the return of the master will be completely unexpected by the servant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases, especially if putting both of them in your translation might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “at a time that is a complete surprise to the servant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

12:46	vg1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διχοτομήσει αὐτὸν	1	The expression **cut him in two** could mean one of two things, depending on how the word **unfaithful** is understood (see next note): (1) if **unfaithful** means “untrustworthy,” then the expression is probably figurative, since the master could not reassign this servant to less important responsibilities if he **cut him in two**. Alternate translation: “will punish him severely” (2) if **unfaithful** means “unbelieving,” then the expression is more literal, since it would describe something that will happen when God judges the world. Alternate translation: “destroy his body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:46	l817			τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀπίστων θήσει	1	The term that ULT translates as **unfaithful** could mean: (1) “untrustworthy.” The meaning would be that the master will assign this servant to less important responsibilities, along with other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted with important ones. Alternate translation: “will give him unimportant responsibilities, like other servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted” (2) “unbelieving.” The master in the parable represents God, and Jesus would be speaking of what God will do, when he judges the world, to people who show by their disobedience that they do not have genuine faith. Alternate translation: “will assign him a place with the unbelievers”
12:46	l818		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν ἀπίστων	1	Jesus is using the adjective **unfaithful** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this expression with an equivalent phrase. The meaning will depend on how you decided to translate **unfaithful** (see previous note). Alternate translation: “servants who have shown that they cannot be trusted” or “people who have shown that they are not genuine believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
12:47	p1l2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐκεῖνος δὲ ὁ δοῦλος, ὁ γνοὺς τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ, καὶ μὴ ἑτοιμάσας ἢ ποιήσας πρὸς τὸ θέλημα αὐτοῦ, δαρήσεται πολλάς	1	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to use two sentences if you translate it that way. Alternate translation: “Suppose a servant knew what his master wanted him to do, and suppose he did not get ready or do what the master wanted. Then his master would punish him severely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
12:47	aj41			τὸ θέλημα τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “what his master wanted him to do”
12:47	im3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δαρήσεται πολλάς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

12:48	nn9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δαρήσεται ὀλίγας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action.

Jesus is using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine them, especially if putting both of them in your translation might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “if someone entrusts many resources to a person, he will expect that person to produce much from those resources” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
12:48	ehu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παντὶ & ᾧ ἐδόθη πολύ, πολὺ ζητηθήσεται παρ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active verbal forms to express the meaning of the two passive verbal forms here.

12:48	ir7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ᾧ παρέθεντο πολύ, περισσότερον αἰτήσουσιν αὐτόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active verbal forms to express the meaning of the two passive verbal forms here.

12:49	qy62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πῦρ ἦλθον βαλεῖν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the effects of his ministry and teaching. In context, since he says contrastingly in [12:51](../12/51.md) that he did not come to bring peace to the earth, **fire** likely represents the passionate responses to him, both favorable and unfavorable, that would lead to the divisions he describes in [12:52-53](../12/52.md). Alternate translation: “My coming will lead to conflict among people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:49	l820		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν γῆν	1	Jesus says **the earth** figuratively to mean the people living on the earth. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
12:49	ygv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	This exclamation emphasizes how much Jesus wants this to happen. Alternate translation: “I wish very much that this fire were already lit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
12:49	ygx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τί θέλω εἰ ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	This exclamation continues the metaphor of **fire** as conflict. Alternate translation: “how I wish that people were already taking sides” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:49	l821		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤδη ἀνήφθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the fire were already burning” or “people were already taking sides” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

12:50	hn1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βάπτισμα & ἔχω βαπτισθῆναι	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of **baptism** to describe how he must suffer. Just as water covers a person during baptism, suffering will overwhelm Jesus. Alternate translation: “I must be overwhelmed by suffering” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:50	l822		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βάπτισμα & ἔχω βαπτισθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “suffering must overwhelm me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:50	r2yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	πῶς συνέχομαι ἕως ὅτου τελεσθῇ	1	This exclamation emphasizes how distressed Jesus is.

12:50	l823		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πῶς συνέχομαι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “this suffering will continue to distress me terribly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:50	l824		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἕως ὅτου τελεσθῇ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “until I have endured all of it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

He is using the question form as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do not think that I came to bring peace on the earth.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

12:51	l827		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐχί & ἀλλ’ ἢ διαμερισμόν	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. These words can be supplied from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “No … I came to bring division instead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
12:51	np4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὐχί & ἀλλ’ ἢ διαμερισμόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **division** with an equivalent expression.

12:55	gq22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νότον πνέοντα	1	Wind coming from this direction would indicate that hot weather was coming in Israel, because the desert was to the **south**. If hot winds blow from a different direction in your region, you could use a general expression here. Alternate translation: “the wind is blowing from a certain direction” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:55	l835		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ὅτι καύσων ἔσται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you say that it is going to be very hot” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
12:55	l836			καὶ γίνεται	1	Alternate translation: “and it does get hot”
12:56	l837		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑποκριταί!	1	The implication, which Jesus draws out in the rest of this verse, is that people who could understand the weather from signs such as wind and clouds also ought to be able to understand what God was doing through Jesus from the signs surrounding his ministry. So if they did not welcome him, it was not because they did not see or understand these signs. Rather, it was because they were pretending not to see or understand them. Alternate translation: “You are pretending not to understand!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:56	jdj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ πρόσωπον	1	Jesus uses the term **face** figuratively to mean “appearance.” Alternate translation: “the appearance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
12:56	y3yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τὸν καιρὸν δὲ τοῦτον, πῶς οὐκ οἴδατε δοκιμάζειν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “so you ought to be able to understand what is happening right now.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:57	w8rz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί δὲ καὶ ἀφ’ ἑαυτῶν, οὐ κρίνετε τὸ δίκαιον?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You ought to discern on your own what is right.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:58	y75j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις μετὰ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου ἐπ’ ἄρχοντα	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach the crowd. Alternate translation: “Suppose you owed someone money, and suppose they were taking you to court to collect it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
12:58	l838		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις μετὰ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου ἐπ’ ἄρχοντα	1	This hypothetical situation is also an illustration designed to help the people understand that they should be welcoming Jesus. Just as the debtor is going to be judged imminently, God is going to judge them imminently based on their responses to Jesus, and so they should make a positive response now, before it is too late. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus gave the crowd this illustration to help them understand. ‘Suppose you owed someone money, and suppose he was taking you to court to collect it’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
12:58	f1ea		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	ὑπάγεις & σου & σε	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
12:58	t4v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου	1	In the context of this story, the term **adversary** means specifically an opponent in a legal proceeding. You could translate it with the equivalent term in your language. Alternatively, since the next verse indicates that the **adversary** is trying to collect a debt, you could describe him in a way that indicates that. Alternate translation: “your opponent” or “your creditor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:58	e7hz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἄρχοντα	1	**Magistrate** is a general term for a person in legal authority. You can translate it with the equivalent general term in your language. Alternate translation: “the official” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:58	b7sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπηλλάχθαι ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “to settle the matter out of court” or “to have him forgive your debt” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:58	l839		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸν κριτήν	1	The term **the judge** refers to the same person as the **magistrate**, but the term here is more specific and threatening. In your translation you can use the specific term in your language that describes someone with the power to deliver a verdict and pass sentence on a defendant. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:58	l840		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ πράκτορι	1	In the context of the story, the term **the officer** refers to a court official who was empowered to collect debts that a judge had ruled were owed and to put the debtor in prison if he did not pay. Your language may have a similar term that you can use. Alternate translation: “the bailiff” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:59	wi7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	λέγω σοι	1	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples and the crowd. If you translated the previous verse as a hypothetical condition, you could translate this expression as an introduction to the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “If that happens, then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
12:59	l841		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	λέγω σοι	1	Even though Jesus is speaking directly to the crowd, he is still addressing an individual situation, so **you** is singular here and in the rest of this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural form of **you** in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
12:59	i124		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	καὶ τὸ ἔσχατον λεπτὸν	1	A **lepton** was the smallest and least valuable coin in circulation in this place and time. It was equivalent to about a tenth of an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “the very last penny” or “every bit of money that your creditor demands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
13:intro	xaa2				0	# Luke 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches with parables (13:1-30)\n2. Jesus speaks about Herod and Jerusalem (13:31-35)\n\n## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Unknown events\n\nThe people and Jesus speak about two events that they knew about, but about which no one today knows anything except what Luke has written. These events are Pilate executing some Galileans in the temple, 13:1-2, and 18 people being killed when a tower collapsed in Jerusalem, 13:4. In your translation, you should tell your readers no more than what Luke tells about what happened. Your translation should tell only what Luke tells.\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Those who are least important will be first, and those who are most important will be last” (Luke 13:30)
13:1	t1fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δέ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what Jesus teaches next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
13:1	l842		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	παρῆσαν & τινες ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ, ἀπαγγέλλοντες αὐτῷ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “There were some people present at that time who were telling him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
13:1	wg2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν αὐτῷ τῷ καιρῷ	1	This implicitly means while Jesus was still teaching the crowds, as Luke said he was doing in [11:54](../11/54.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “while he was still teaching the crowds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:1	l843		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	Luke is speaking figuratively about this event to indicate that the **blood** of the Galileans was shed at the same time as the blood of their animal **sacrifices**. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:1	fj2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	Luke uses the term **blood** figuratively to refer to the death of these Galileans. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate had killed while they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:1	l844		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὧν τὸ αἷμα Πειλᾶτος ἔμιξεν μετὰ τῶν θυσιῶν αὐτῶν	1	Pilate likely did not kill these Galileans personally. Rather, he ordered his soldiers to kill them. Alternate translation: “whom Pilate’s soldiers had killed as they were offering sacrifices at the temple” or “whom Pilate had ordered his soldiers to kill as they were offering sacrifices at the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:1	l845		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Πειλᾶτος	1	**Pilate** is the name of a man; he was the Roman ruler of Judea in this time. See how you translated his name in [3:1](../03/01.md). His name occurs many times later in the book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:2	l846		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the people in the crowd told him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
13:2	zfa8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	δοκεῖτε ὅτι	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach these people and the whole crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do not think that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
13:2	l847			ἁμαρτωλοὶ παρὰ πάντας τοὺς Γαλιλαίους	1	Alternate translation: “more sinful than all the other Galileans” or “the most sinful of all Galileans”
13:2	l848			ταῦτα πεπόνθασιν	1	Alternate translation: “this happened to them”
13:3	xl6m			οὐχί, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell these people and the crowd. Alternate translation: “That is certainly not the case”
13:3	a3ez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες ὁμοίως ἀπολεῖσθε	1	This statement seems to be similar to the one that Jesus makes in [19:41-44](../19/41.md), in which he says that if the Jewish people reject him and instead follow violent false messiahs, this will bring them into conflict with the Romans and they will be destroyed. That seems to be the implicit meaning here as well, and you could express that in your translation. Alternate translation: “you too will be destroyed by the Romans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:4	hj5w			ἢ ἐκεῖνοι	1	Jesus is giving a second example of people who suffered. Alternate translation: “Also consider those”
13:4	e2s8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκεῖνοι οἱ δεκαοκτὼ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **18** (eighteen) as a noun in order to indicate a certain group of people. Alternate translation: “those 18 people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
13:4	p6r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σιλωὰμ	1	**Siloam** is the name of an area in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
13:4	vg9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	δοκεῖτε ὅτι	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach these the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do not think that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
13:4	at9i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὀφειλέται	1	This is a figurative way of describing someone as a sinner. Alternate translation: “sinners” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:4	l849		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπους	1	Here Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
13:5	m77t			οὐχί, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses this expression to emphasize what he is about to tell these people and the crowd. Alternate translation: “That is certainly not the case”
13:5	ckc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες ὡσαύτως ἀπολεῖσθε	1	See how you translated the similar statement in [13:3](../13/03.md). In this case, the people whom Jesus is using as an example were not destroyed by the Romans, so the comparison does not include that detail. Alternate translation: “you too will be destroyed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:6	sm1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἔλεγεν δὲ ταύτην τὴν παραβολήν	1	Jesus now gives a brief illustration to help the crowd understand what he has been saying. Alternate translation: “Then he told them this story to help them understand what he had been saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
13:6	l850		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	συκῆν εἶχέν τις πεφυτευμένην ἐν τῷ ἀμπελῶνι αὐτοῦ	1	This introduces a character in the parable. Alternate translation: “There was a man who owned a vineyard in which a fig tree had been planted” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
13:6	x42j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συκῆν εἶχέν τις πεφυτευμένην	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “Someone had planted a fig tree” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:6	l851		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	συκῆν	1	A **fig tree** is a type of fruit tree that is common in the land of Israel. If your readers would not know what a fig tree is, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a fruit tree” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:6	l852		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἦλθεν ζητῶν καρπὸν ἐν αὐτῇ, καὶ οὐχ εὗρεν	1	This is background information that helps listeners understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “he went to see if there were any figs on the tree, but there were none” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
13:6	l853		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθεν ζητῶν καρπὸν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Here your language might use a form of “go” rather than a form of “come.” Alternate translation: “he went to see if there were any figs on the tree” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
13:7	l854		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν & πρὸς τὸν ἀμπελουργόν, ἰδοὺ, τρία ἔτη ἀφ’ οὗ ἔρχομαι ζητῶν καρπὸν ἐν τῇ συκῇ ταύτῃ, καὶ οὐχ εὑρίσκω. ἔκκοψον αὐτήν, ἵνα τί καὶ τὴν γῆν καταργεῖ?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he told the gardener to pay attention, that he had been coming for three years to look for fruit on the fig tree, but he had not found any, and so the gardener should cut the tree down because it was keeping the ground from being productive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
13:7	l855		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The man uses the term **behold** to get the gardener to pay attention to what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Pay attention” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:7	hg35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἵνα τί καὶ τὴν γῆν καταργεῖ?	1	The man uses the question form to emphasize that the tree is useless and that the gardener should cut it down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Do not let it keep the ground from being productive any longer.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
13:7	l856		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν γῆν καταργεῖ	1	The man speaks figuratively of the tree as if it were keeping the ground from working, since the ground would be productive if a different tree that actually was bearing fruit were in its place. Alternate translation: “is it … keeping the ground from being productive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:8	pm3j			ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς λέγει αὐτῷ	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Jesus uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “But he responded”
13:8	l857		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ & ἀποκριθεὶς λέγει	1	Together the terms **answering** and **says** mean that the gardener responded to what his master told him to do. Alternate translation: “he responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
13:8	l2ks			ἄφες αὐτὴν καὶ τοῦτο τὸ ἔτος	1	Alternate translation: “wait one more year before cutting down the tree”
13:8	st4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βάλω κόπρια	1	The word **manure** means animal dung. In some places people mix it into the ground to make the soil more fertile for plants and trees. If your readers would not be familiar with this practice, you could explain it, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “mix animal dung into the soil to enrich it” or “fertilize it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:9	w5qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	κἂν μὲν ποιήσῃ καρπὸν εἰς τὸ μέλλον	1	The gardener does not specify what he thinks the master should do with the tree if it does bear fruit, but you can supply that information from the context. Alternate translation: “If the tree has figs on it next year, then you can allow it to keep growing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
13:9	j4ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἐκκόψεις αὐτήν	1	The servant is using a statement to make a suggestion. He is not giving a command in the form of a future statement, as some languages allow speakers to do. Alternate translation: “you can have me cut it down for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
13:10	p3el		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
13:10	c3j8			ἐν τοῖς Σάββασιν	1	Your language might use an indefinite article rather than the definite article here, since Luke does not specify which particular Sabbath day this was. Alternate translation: “on a Sabbath day”
13:11	l858		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:11	wn7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	γυνὴ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a woman there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
13:11	hqj5			πνεῦμα ἔχουσα ἀσθενείας	1	Alternate translation: “whom an evil spirit had been making weak”
13:11	l859		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	εἰς τὸ παντελές	1	Luke is using the adjective **complete** as a noun in order to indicate the woman’s full height. Alternate translation: “to her complete height” or “completely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
13:12	l860		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γύναι	1	Unlike the term **man** in [12:14](../12/14.md), in this context Jesus uses the term **woman** gently and compassionately. Alternate translation: “My dear woman” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:12	h6ne		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀπολέλυσαι τῆς ἀσθενείας σου	1	By saying this, Jesus healed the woman. You could express this in your translation with a statement that shows that Jesus was causing this to happen. Alternate translation: “I now set you free from your weakness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
13:12	l29y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γύναι, ἀπολέλυσαι τῆς ἀσθενείας σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I now set you free from your weakness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

13:14	d8ir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς & ἔλεγεν	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that the synagogue leader spoke in response to the healing he had just witnessed. Alternate translation: “responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
13:14	l861			ἓξ ἡμέραι εἰσὶν ἐν αἷς δεῖ ἐργάζεσθαι	1	Alternate translation: “You must only do work on the first six days of the week”
13:14	ai1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν αὐταῖς & ἐρχόμενοι θεραπεύεσθε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “come and have Jesus heal you on those days” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:14	qap4			τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	Your language might use an indefinite article rather than the definite article here, since the synagogue ruler is not speaking of a specific Sabbath. Alternate translation: “on a Sabbath day”
13:15	l862			ὁ Κύριος	1	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the respectful title **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
13:15	k7p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίθη & αὐτῷ & καὶ εἶπεν	1	Together the two words **answered** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the synagogue ruler. Alternate translation: “responded to the synagogue ruler” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
13:15	u6zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑποκριταί	1	Jesus is speaking directly to the synagogue ruler, but the plural form indicates that he is including other religious leaders as well. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You and your fellow religious leaders are hypocrites” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:15	xt5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἕκαστος ὑμῶν τῷ Σαββάτῳ οὐ λύει	1	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. He is not asking his listeners to tell him whether they would do this. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “On the Sabbath, each one of you unties” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
13:15	ha7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸν βοῦν αὐτοῦ, ἢ τὸν ὄνον	1	These are domesticated animals. If your readers would not be familiar with what an **ox** or a **donkey** is, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “his farm animals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:15	kbj4			τῷ Σαββάτῳ	1	Here your language might use an indefinite article rather than the definite article, since Jesus is not speaking of a specific Sabbath. Alternate translation: “even on a Sabbath day”
13:16	br72		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	θυγατέρα Ἀβραὰμ	1	Jesus is using the word **daughter** figuratively to mean “descendant.” Alternate translation: “a descendant of Abraham” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

13:19	l869		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος	1	This could: (1) be a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “a person” (2) refers to a man and a woman in paired examples to offer a comprehensive teaching about the kingdom of God, since Jesus speaks in his next illustration of a **woman** doing something.

13:25	gk3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ἄρξησθε & ὑμῖν & ὑμᾶς	1	Even though Jesus is answering an individual’s question, he is talking to the whole crowd, so the word **you** is plural in all of these cases. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

Alternate translation: “for now I will continue to carry on my ministry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
13:32	l909		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκβάλλω δαιμόνια, καὶ ἰάσεις ἀποτελῶ σήμερον καὶ αὔριον	1	The implication is that Jesus is saying he knows he does not need to be afraid of Herod’s deadly intentions, even though he is in territory that Herod rules, because God will keep him safe while he carries out his ministry. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I know that for now, with God’s protection, I can safely carry on my ministry even in Herod’s territory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:32	l910		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῇ τρίτῃ	1	In this culture, **the third day** meant “the day after tomorrow.” Jesus is using the expression as an idiom. Alternate translation: “at a short time in the future” or “soon” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:32	l911		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τελειοῦμαι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. This could mean: (1) Jesus is saying he will soon complete his work of teaching and healing. Alternate translation: “I will complete my ministry” (2) this expression refers to someone reaching a goal or destination. Alternate translation: “I will finish traveling through Herod’s territory and reach Jerusalem” (3) Jesus is referring to a goal or destination figuratively, and mean that he will reach the end of his life. Alternate translation: “I will give my life as a sacrifice” (4) the expression describes someone reaching maturity or perfection of character, and if that is what it means here, it would describe the character that Jesus demonstrated when he gave his life as the Savior. Alternate translation: “I will demonstrate supreme love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:33	p9za			πλὴν δεῖ με & πορεύεσθαι	1	Alternate translation: “But I must keep traveling”
13:33	l912		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σήμερον καὶ αὔριον καὶ τῇ ἐχομένῃ	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “now and in the time just ahead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:33	nbk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	οὐκ ἐνδέχεται προφήτην ἀπολέσθαι ἔξω Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	This could also mean “it is not acceptable.” Either way, Jesus is speaking ironically. The Jewish leaders claimed to serve God, and yet their ancestors killed many of God’s prophets in Jerusalem. Jesus knew that they would kill him there too. Alternate translation: “it is in Jerusalem that the Jewish leaders have killed so many of God’s messengers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
13:34	cac7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	Ἰερουσαλὴμ, Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	Jesus is figuratively addressing something he knows cannot hear him, the city of Jerusalem, in order to show his listeners in a strong way how he feels about it. Alternate translation: “I am very upset with the city of Jerusalem” or, if you decide to use the second person (see later note), “I am very upset with you, Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
13:34	l913		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἡ ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ λιθοβολοῦσα τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “who kills the prophets God sends her by stoning them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
13:34	l914		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ λιθοβολοῦσα τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of the city as if it were female. Your language may customarily use neuter pronouns for cities. Alternate translation: “which kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
13:34	gb6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ λιθοβολοῦσα τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	If your readers would find it strange that Jesus is addressing the city, you could make it clear that he is really speaking about the people who live in the city: “whose people kill the prophets and stone those sent to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
13:34	l915		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἡ ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ λιθοβολοῦσα τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	Jesus speaks of the city in the third person, even though he is addressing it directly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
13:34	zhg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “those God has sent to her” or “those God has sent to it” or “those God has sent to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:34	rj48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ποσάκις ἠθέλησα	1	This is an exclamation and not a question. Alternate translation: “I have desired so often” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
13:34	q1i3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπισυνάξαι τὰ τέκνα σου	1	Jesus is figuratively describing the people who live in Jerusalem as if they were the **children** of the city. Alternate translation: “to gather your people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:34	q4nf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὃν τρόπον ὄρνις τὴν ἑαυτῆς νοσσιὰν ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας	1	Jesus is leaving out the word **gathers** that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. you could supply this word from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “the way a hen gathers her own brood under her wings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
13:34	l916		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	σου	1	Even though Jesus is speaking of the people who live in Jerusalem, he is figuratively addressing the city, so **your** would be singular. The pronoun **you** would also be a singular pronoun in any case where it is needed in your language as a pronoun for a verb, for example, “you were not willing,” and in the phrase “sent to you,” if you decide to use the second person. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
13:34	kb9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὃν τρόπον ὄρνις τὴν ἑαυτῆς νοσσιὰν ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας	1	Jesus uses this comparison to describe how he wishes he could care for the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “just as if I were a hen gathering her chicks under her wings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
13:34	l917		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν ἑαυτῆς νοσσιὰν	1	The term **brood** refers collectively to all of the young offspring of a bird. Alternate translation: “her chicks” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
13:34	l918		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας	1	The implication is that a hen would put her baby chicks there to protect them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “under her wings to protect them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:35	l919		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus uses the term **Behold** to call attention to what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:35	l920		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	Jesus is figuratively using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. Alternate translation: “your house will be left to you alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
13:35	w1v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of the city of Jerusalem as if it were a **house** in which its people lived. Alternate translation: “your city will be left to you alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
13:35	l921		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God is going to leave your city to you alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
13:35	l922		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	The implications of this statement are that God will no longer consider that Jerusalem belongs to him, as a holy city where he dwells in his temple, and that God will therefore not protect the people of Jerusalem from their enemies. Alternate translation: “God will not protect you from your enemies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:35	l923		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν & ὑμῶν & ὑμῖν	1	Jesus is now speaking directly to the people who live in Jerusalem, so **your** and **you** would be plural. The pronoun **you** would also be a plural pronoun in any case where it is needed in your language as a pronoun for a verb, for example, “you say.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
13:35	l924			λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is telling the people of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
13:35	x4y6			οὐ μὴ με ἴδητέ ἕως ἥξει ὅτε εἴπητε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this a positive statement. Alternate translation: “the next time you see me, you will say”
13:35	l925		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἕως ἥξει ὅτε εἴπητε	1	The expression **it comes** means “the time comes.” You could express that in your translation, or, if your language does not speak of time as “coming,” you can use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “until the time comes when you say” or “until the time when you say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
13:35	l926		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτε εἴπητε, εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

13:35	v6lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου	1	God’s **name** figuratively represents his power and authority. Alternate translation: “as God’s representative” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
14:intro	xk3w				0	# Luke 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus attends a banquet and tells a parable about a banquet (14:1-24)\n2. Jesus teaches more about being his disciple (14:25-35)\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Parable\n\nJesus told the parable in Luke 14:15-24 to teach that the kingdom of God will be something that everyone can enjoy, but many people will refuse to be part of it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted” (14:11).
14:1	dj2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
14:1	a3ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])

14:1	jst8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ αὐτοὶ ἦσαν παρατηρούμενοι αὐτόν	1	The implication is that other Pharisees were also present, as [14:3](../14/03.md) indicates explicitly, and that they all wanted to find a way to accuse Jesus of saying or doing something wrong. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It might be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Many other Pharisees were present, and they were all watching Jesus closely to try to catch him saying or doing something wrong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
14:2	l927		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
14:2	f5gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
14:2	l4a1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἦν ὑδρωπικὸς	1	This means that the man had edema. That is a condition that causes swelling when water builds up in parts of the body. Your language may have a specific name for this condition. If not, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “who was suffering because parts of his body were swollen with water” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
14:2	l929		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἦν ὑδρωπικὸς	1	Luke provides this background information about the man to help readers understand what happens in this episode. Jesus was facing the issue of whether to heal this man on the Sabbath, which the Pharisees thought was wrong. Alternate translation: “who was suffering because parts of his body were swollen with water” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
14:2	l930		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” another person. Alternate translation: “was in the presence of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
14:3	l931		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	The term **answering** indicates that Jesus **spoke** in response to the situation that he observed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he saw the man, Jesus spoke” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
14:3	l932		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοὺς νομικοὺς	1	See how you translated **lawyers** in [7:45](../07/45.md). In this context, the term **lawyers** refers to experts in the law of Moses and its application to various situations. Alternate translation: “the experts in the Jewish law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
14:3	qak4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἔξεστιν τῷ Σαββάτῳ θεραπεῦσαι ἢ οὔ?	1	Jesus is not asking this question for information or to get guidance about what he should do. Rather, he is using the question to challenge the Pharisees and lawyers to think about the meaning and purpose of the Sabbath. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as an imperative. Alternate translation: “If you think the law does not permit healing on the Sabbath, explain why.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
14:4	pj9t			οἱ δὲ ἡσύχασαν	1	Alternate translation: “But the religious leaders would not answer Jesus’ question”
14:4	l933		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Because the religious leaders made no objection to healing on the Sabbath, as a result, Jesus healed the man.

14:4	x4lq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπιλαβόμενος	1	Alternate translation: “Jesus took hold of the man who was suffering from edema and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
14:5	l934		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
14:5	rr5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνος ὑμῶν υἱὸς ἢ βοῦς εἰς φρέαρ πεσεῖται, καὶ οὐκ εὐθέως ἀνασπάσει αὐτὸν ἐν ἡμέρᾳ τοῦ Σαββάτου	1	Jesus does not expect these religious leaders to tell him whether they would do this. Rather, he is using the question form as a teaching tool. He wants these religious leaders to recognize that on the Sabbath day, they themselves would do something to address a situation of suffering and need. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “If one of you had a son who fell into a well on the Sabbath, surely you would pull him out immediately. You would even do the same thing for your ox.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
14:6	cti5			καὶ οὐκ ἴσχυσαν ἀνταποκριθῆναι πρὸς ταῦτα	1	Alternate translation: “And there was nothing they could say in response”
14:7	l935		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔλεγεν & παραβολήν & ἐπέχων πῶς τὰς πρωτοκλισίας ἐξελέγοντο	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of the phrases in this verse, since the second phrase gives the reason for the action that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Jesus noticed that those whom the leader of the Pharisees had invited to the meal were trying to sit in the seats for honored guests, so he gave them an illustration” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
14:7	u86b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἔλεγεν & παραβολήν	1	In this instance, Luke is not using the term **parable** to mean a brief story that teaches something true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Jesus used a hypothetical situation as an illustration to get the guests at this meal to consider how they should behave at feasts. Alternate translation: “he gave an illustration” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
14:7	em4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοὺς κεκλημένους	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who had done the action.

14:7	yd4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰς πρωτοκλισίας	1	The term **first** figuratively represents being important and honored. If your culture has a way of placing people at meals to show honor, you could use that in your translation. Otherwise, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the seats closest to the host” or “the seats for honored guests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
14:8	l936		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ὅταν κληθῇς ὑπό τινος εἰς γάμους, μὴ κατακλιθῇς	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to teach the guests at this meal.

14:8	l937		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ κατακλιθῇς	1	See how you translated this phrase in [5:29](../05/29.md). Alternate translation: “do not take your place at the table” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
14:8	l938		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν πρωτοκλισίαν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [14:7](../14/07.md). Alternate translation: “in a seat for an honored guest” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “the host may also have invited a person who is more important than you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
14:8	l939		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐντιμότερός	1	Jesus is using the comparative adjective **more honorable** as a noun. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “a person who is more important” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
14:8	m5b9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σου	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to the crowd, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular in [14:8-10](../14/08.md). But if the singular forms of these pronouns would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
14:9	l940		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐλθὼν, ὁ σὲ καὶ αὐτὸν καλέσας	1	In this culture, the host would come into the banquet hall after all the guests were seated. If the practice is different in your culture, you could use a general expression in your translation here. Alternate translation: “when the person who invited both of you sees the seating arrangements” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
14:9	ecp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἄρξῃ μετὰ αἰσχύνης τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον κατέχειν	1	Jesus uses the term **begin** idiomatically to suggest slowly unfolding, reluctant action. Alternate translation: “you will be ashamed and reluctantly have to take the last place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
14:9	gqa6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον	1	The term **last** figuratively represents being unimportant and not honored. If your culture has a way of placing people at meals to show honor, you could use that in your translation. Otherwise, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a seat far from the host” or “a seat for the least important person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
14:9	l941		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἔσχατον τόπον	1	The implication is that this guest must go to the least important section of seats because all the other places have been taken in the meantime. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a seat for the least important person, since all the other seats will be taken” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
14:10	x5qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅταν κληθῇς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who does the action.

14:10	l942		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνάπεσε	1	See how you translated this phrase in [14:8](../14/08.md). Alternate translation: “take your place at the table” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

If the practice is different in your culture, you could use a general expression in your translation here. Alternate translation: “when the person who invited you sees where you are sitting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
14:10	ck9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	προσανάβηθι ἀνώτερον	1	The host speaks figuratively of the more important places at the feast being **higher** than the less important ones.

14:12	gmh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	μὴ φώνει	1	Jesus is probably not telling his host never to invite such people.

14:16	m7bc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις	1	This introduces a character in the parable. Alternate translation: “There was a man who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

14:18	eh3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	This word introduces a contrast between what was expected, that all the invited guests would come to the dinner, and what happened, that they all declined to do that.

14:18	l3r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ πρῶτος εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	While **him** refers to the servant, the implication is that this first guest was giving the servant a message for his master, since it would be the master, not the servant, who would excuse him from attending the banquet.

14:20	gy6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	γυναῖκα ἔγημα	1	In your language, it might seem that this phrase expresses unnecessary extra information. If so, you could abbreviate it.

Alternate translation: “boundary fences” (2) since the term is paired with **roads**, it may figuratively mean the footpaths that run along hedges at the borders of fields. Alternate translation: “paths” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

It is not clear why. Possibly it may be assumed that other servants have been helping and that the master is now addressing all of the servants at once. In that case, it would make sense to translate **you** using the plural form, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
14:24	ooz4			λέγω & ὑμῖν	1	The master says this to emphasize what he is telling his servants. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”

14:24	l966			μου τοῦ δείπνου	1	By this expression, the master does not mean his own meal, but the dinner that he has prepared for others. Alternate translation: “the dinner that I have prepared”

Jesus assumes that the crowds will also know that the Romans made these criminals carry these wooden crosses through the streets to the place where they were going to be executed. Alternate translation: “does not carry the wooden cross on which he will be executed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
14:27	jn5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ βαστάζει τὸν σταυρὸν αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus uses the phrase **carry his cross**, referring to this practice of execution figuratively, to say that his disciples must be people who have given up their lives to God and who are willing to suffer.

14:29	ym3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ μὴ ἰσχύοντος ἐκτελέσαι	1	The implication is that this person was not able to finish the building because he did not have enough money.

15:intro	p1ba				0	# Luke 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus tells parables about a lost sheep, a lost coin, and a lost son (15:1-32)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The parable of the prodigal son\n\nThe story that Jesus tells in Luke 15:11-32 is known as The Parable of the Prodigal Son, although he does not give the story that title himself. Most interpreters understand the father in the story to represent God (the Father), the sinful younger son to represent those who repent and come to faith in Jesus, and the self-righteous older son to represent the Pharisees. In the story, the older son becomes angry at the father for forgiving the younger son’s sins. He will not even go in to the party that the father is giving to welcome the younger son home. Jesus knew that the Pharisees wanted God to think that only they were good and not forgive other people’s sins. Jesus was teaching them that they would never become part of God’s kingdom if they continued to think that way. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Sinners\n\nWhen the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins such as stealing or sexual sins. But Jesus told three parables (15:4-7, 15:8-10, and 15:11-32) to teach that the people who acknowledge that they are sinners and who repent are the people who truly please God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
15:1	yj6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
15:1	l982		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἦσαν & αὐτῷ ἐγγίζοντες πάντες οἱ τελῶναι καὶ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἀκούειν αὐτοῦ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce new characters into the story. These people were part of the crowd that Luke described generally in [14:25](../14/25.md). Alternate translation: “many of the people who were coming to listen to Jesus were tax collectors and sinners” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
15:1	ss52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἦσαν & αὐτῷ ἐγγίζοντες πάντες οἱ τελῶναι καὶ οἱ ἁμαρτωλοὶ ἀκούειν αὐτοῦ	1	The word **all** is an overstatement for emphasis. Alternate translation: “many of the people who were coming to listen to Jesus were tax collectors and sinners” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
15:2	l986		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to indicate the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
15:2	l987		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	διεγόγγυζον οἵ τε Φαρισαῖοι καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς	1	Luke uses this phrase to reintroduce these characters into the story. While these may not be exactly the same individuals whom Jesus encountered in places such as [5:17-30](../05/17.md), the members of this group in general function as the same character throughout the story. Alternate translation: “some Pharisees and scribes were there, and they were grumbling” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
15:2	dd9b			οὗτος ἁμαρτωλοὺς προσδέχεται	1	Alternate translation: “This man lets sinners into his presence” or “This man associates with sinners”
15:2	ec2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος	1	This expression implicitly means Jesus. Alternate translation: “This man” or “Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:3	l988		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to indicate the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
15:3	ill7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	εἶπεν & πρὸς αὐτοὺς τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	Alternate translation: “Jesus told this story to the Pharisees and scribes to help them understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
15:4	pxm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν, ἔχων ἑκατὸν πρόβατα καὶ ἀπολέσας ἐξ αὐτῶν ἓν, οὐ καταλείπει τὰ ἐνενήκοντα ἐννέα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καὶ πορεύεται ἐπὶ τὸ ἀπολωλὸς, ἕως εὕρῃ αὐτό?	1	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “If one of you had 100 sheep and lost one of them, he would certainly leave the other 99 sheep in the wilderness and go looking for the sheep that had wandered off until he found it.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
15:4	l989		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν, ἔχων ἑκατὸν πρόβατα καὶ ἀπολέσας ἐξ αὐτῶν ἓν, οὐ καταλείπει	1	Jesus is offering the Pharisees and scribes an illustration that involves a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you had 100 sheep and you lost one of them. Then you would certainly leave” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
15:4	m048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν, ἔχων ἑκατὸν πρόβατα & ἕως εὕρῃ αὐτό	1	Since Jesus begins the parable by asking, “Which man among you,” some languages would continue the parable in the second person. Alternate translation: “Which one of you, if you had 100 sheep … until you found it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
15:4	l990		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τίς ἄνθρωπος ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	This could mean: (1) while all of the Pharisees and scribes who are grumbling are probably men, Jesus is describing what any person, man or woman, would likely do in this situation, and he is telling the parable for the whole crowd to hear. So the term **man** here may be generic. Alternate translation: “Which person among you” (2) since Jesus speaks in his next parable of a woman doing something, he may be using a man and a woman in paired examples to offer a comprehensive teaching about the kingdom of God. In that case, the term **man** here would not be generic. Alternate translation: “Which of you men” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
15:5	l992		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	καὶ εὑρὼν, ἐπιτίθησιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους αὐτοῦ χαίρων	1	If you decided in the previous verse that your language would continue this parable in the second person, use the second person here as well. Alternate translation: “Once you found it, you would very happily lay it across your shoulders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
15:5	xwa5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιτίθησιν ἐπὶ τοὺς ὤμους αὐτοῦ	1	This is the way a shepherd carries a sheep. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he lays it across his shoulders to carry it home” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:6	g3f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	καὶ ἐλθὼν εἰς τὸν οἶκον, συνκαλεῖ τοὺς φίλους καὶ τοὺς γείτονας	1	If you decided that your language would continue this parable in the second person, use the second person here as well. Alternate translation: “And when you got back to your house, you would call together your friends and neighbors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
15:6	l993		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων αὐτοῖς, συνχάρητέ μοι, ὅτι εὗρον τὸ πρόβατόν μου τὸ ἀπολωλός	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and tells them to rejoice with him because he has found his sheep that was lost” or, if you decided to use the second person, “and you would tell them to rejoice with you because you had found your sheep that was lost” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
15:7	l994			λέγω ὑμῖν ὅτι	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell these Pharisees and scribes. Alternate translation: “I can assure you that”
15:7	k1l2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὕτως	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the implicit meaning here. Alternate translation: “just as the shepherd and his friends and neighbors would rejoice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:7	k8k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	χαρὰ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἔσται	1	Jesus is using the word **heaven** figuratively to mean the inhabitants of heaven. Alternate translation: “everyone in heaven will rejoice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:7	abcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	δικαίοις	1	Jesus is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate the word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are righteous” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
15:8	ly5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς γυνὴ δραχμὰς ἔχουσα δέκα, ἐὰν ἀπολέσῃ δραχμὴν μίαν, οὐχὶ ἅπτει λύχνον, καὶ σαροῖ τὴν οἰκίαν, καὶ ζητεῖ ἐπιμελῶς, ἕως οὗ εὕρῃ?	1	Jesus is using this question as a teaching tool. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “if a woman had ten drachma coins and she lost one of them, she would certainly light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

15:8	l995		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δραχμὰς	1	A **drachma** was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: “valuable silver coins” or “coins each worth a day’s wages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
15:8	l996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	σαροῖ τὴν οἰκίαν	1	Jesus speaks of the whole **house** to refer figuratively to one part of it, the floor. Alternate translation: “sweep the floor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
15:9	l997		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγουσα, συνχάρητέ μοι, ὅτι εὗρον τὴν δραχμὴν ἣν ἀπώλεσα	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

15:11	ib6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	εἶπεν δέ	1	To help the Pharisees and scribes understand what he has been teaching, Jesus tells a brief story that provides a further illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told the Pharisees and scribes this story to help them understand” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
15:11	c2t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄνθρωπός τις εἶχεν δύο υἱούς	1	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the main characters in the parable. Alternate translation: “There was a man who had two sons” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

15:12	y6uq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	δός μοι	1	The son wanted his father to give him his inheritance immediately. If your language has a command form that indicates that the speaker wants something done immediately, it would be appropriate to use that form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
15:12	m000		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ ἐπιβάλλον μέρος τῆς οὐσίας	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “the part of your wealth that you intend to leave to me when you die” or “the share of the estate that I would inherit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

15:16	m003			καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐδίδου αὐτῷ	1	This could mean one of two things. Alternate translation: “because no one was giving him anything else to eat” or “but his master would not allow him to eat even those”

People would give one of their calves special food so that it would grow well, and then, when they wanted to have a special feast, they would butcher and eat that calf. If your readers would not know what a **calf** or a cow is, or if a description of eating a cow would be offensive to them, you could use a general expression here.

15:23	m021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	φαγόντες εὐφρανθῶμεν	1	The phrase **eat and celebrate** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

15:25	m027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἤκουσεν συμφωνίας καὶ χορῶν	1	The older son could not literally hear **dancing**, so Jesus is using the term **heard** figuratively in that case.

15:26	m028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described.

Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
15:26	m029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕνα τῶν παίδων	1	Here the word that is translated as **servant** ordinarily means “boy.” So here it may indicate that the servant was young. Alternate translation: “a young servant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “asked himself what he should do, since his master was taking the management job away from him. He realized that he was not strong enough to dig ditches, and that he would be ashamed to beg for money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
16:3	kng1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ κύριός μου	1	The expression **my master** refers to the rich man.

Interpreters understand them in a variety of ways. It is also unclear whether it is these **friends** who would **welcome** someone into the **eternal dwellings** or whether the expression is indefinite, equivalent to “you will be welcomed into the eternal dwellings.” Because the meaning is unclear and it is interpreted in such a variety of ways, it might be best if your translation did not say any more about this than ULT does.
16:9	q2jb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	Here, the term **unrighteous** is an echo of the previous verse, in which Jesus described the manager by the same term.

16:9	m066			ὅταν ἐκλίπῃ	1	Alternate translation: “when it is gone” or “when it no longer has any value”

16:15	m070		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	Here, Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
16:15	m071		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βδέλυγμα	1	The term **abomination** comes from the regulations for religious life in the Jewish law. It refers to something that provokes feelings of horror and revulsion and must be avoided. Alternate translation: “is detestable” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
16:15	m072		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus is using this expression to mean “where God can see,” and it refers figuratively to perception and judgment. Alternate translation: “from God’s perspective” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

16:16	m073		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate this phrase in [4:43](../04/43.md).

16:19	r67p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄνθρωπος & τις ἦν πλούσιος	1	This introduces one of the characters in the parable. It is not clear whether this is a real person, or simply a person in a story that Jesus is telling in order to make a point. You may need to begin a new sentence here.

16:19	fu76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	καὶ ἐνεδιδύσκετο πορφύραν καὶ βύσσον	1	Jesus is figuratively using two specific types of expensive clothing to mean expensive clothing in general. These were likely not the only types of clothes that the man owned and wore. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He wore very expensive clothes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
16:19	m079		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πορφύραν	1	Jesus uses the term **purple** figuratively to mean clothing colored with purple dye, which was very expensive. Alternate translation: “clothing colored with purple dye” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
16:19	z8v5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βύσσον	1	The term **fine linen** refers to a high quality clothe made from the fibers of the flax plant.

Alternate translation: “There was also a poor man named Lazarus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
16:20	m080		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Λάζαρος	1	**Lazarus** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

16:20	ax4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς τὸν πυλῶνα αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that people brought Lazarus there so that he could beg for money and food from those who went in and out.

16:21	xby9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ κύνες	1	The Jews considered dogs to be unclean animals. Lazarus was too sick and weak to stop them from licking his wounds, so in addition to being poor and sick, he was always ceremonially unclean.

16:22	y7pb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

Within the story, this feast likely represents the joys of heaven, and Jesus may be depicting Abraham, the ancestor of the Jews, as the host.

In your translation, you could indicate that this is not the most he would want Lazarus to do.

16:24	rc6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	καὶ καταψύξῃ τὴν γλῶσσάν μου	1	The rich man is figuratively describing how thirsty he is by association with the way his **tongue** feels hot.

16:25	m086		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνον	1	Abraham is using the term **child** figuratively to mean “descendant.” As a Jew, the rich man was a descendant of Abraham.

16:25	we9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὰ ἀγαθά σου	1	Abraham is using the adjective **good** as a noun. It is plural.

16:26	m088		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμᾶς	1	Abraham means himself and the people who are with him, but not the rich man, so **us** is exclusive in both instances in this verse, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
16:26	m089		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῶν & ὑμᾶς	1	Even though Abraham is speaking to the rich man individually, he is referring to all of the people who are in Hades with him, so **you** is plural in both instances in this verse.

16:29	m095		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀκουσάτωσαν αὐτῶν	1	The implication is that the rich man’s brothers do not need Lazarus to come and warn them, because in the Scriptures they already have all the warning they need.

17:intro	c4am				0	# Luke 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches about forgiveness, faith, and service (17:1-10)\n2. Jesus heals ten lepers (17:11-19)\n3. Jesus teaches about the kingdom of God coming (17:20-37)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Old Testament Examples\n\nJesus uses Noah and Lot’s wife as examples to teach his followers. Noah was ready for the flood when it came, and followers of Jesus need to be ready for him to return, because he will not warn them when he is about to come. Lot’s wife loved the evil city she had been living in so much that God also punished her when he destroyed it. Followers of Jesus need to love him more than anything else. You may need to provide some background information that Jesus assumed his listeners would know so that people who read your translation today can understand what Jesus is teaching here.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nJesus asks his disciples three questions in (17:7-9) to teach them that even those who serve him well are righteous only because of his grace.

Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it” (17:33).\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “In his day”\n\nAt the end of 17:24, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “in his day,” but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.\n\n### “There will be two in the field”\n\nSome ancient manuscripts of the Bible include the verse 17:36, but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have this verse in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.\n\nIn both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the verse if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
17:1	ej1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ἀνένδεκτόν ἐστιν τοῦ τὰ σκάνδαλα μὴ ἐλθεῖν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Traps will certainly come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
17:1	m102		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὰ σκάνδαλα	1	The term **traps** refers to a device that a person or animal would unknowingly activate and that would then confine them in a net, cage, or pit. Your language may have a term for a similar device, and you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:1	m103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ σκάνδαλα	1	Jesus is using the word **traps** figuratively. Alternate translation: “temptations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
17:1	zck5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐαὶ δι’ οὗ ἔρχεται!	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “how terrible it will be for anyone who causes these temptations to come” or “how terrible it will be for any person who tempts others to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
17:2	dvz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λυσιτελεῖ αὐτῷ εἰ	1	Jesus is drawing a comparison to the punishment for causing people to sin. He means that this person’s punishment for causing people to sin will be worse than if he had drowned in the sea. No one would actually put a stone around his neck and throw him into the sea as an alternative to that punishment, and Jesus is not saying that anyone will do so. Alternate translation: “The punishment he will receive will be worse than if” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:2	uk6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λίθος μυλικὸς περίκειται περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that someone would tie the stone around the person’s neck. Alternate translation: “if someone were to attach a millstone around his neck” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:2	gr89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	λίθος μυλικὸς	1	A **millstone** is a very large, heavy, circular stone that is used for grinding grain into flour. If your readers would not be familiar with a millstone, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “a heavy stone” or “a heavy wheel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:2	k9xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίσῃ	1	See how you translated this in [17:1](../17/01.md). Jesus is using the word **trap** figuratively. Alternate translation: “he should tempt to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
17:2	xm7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῶν μικρῶν τούτων	1	This could be: (1) a reference to children who love Jesus and who are physically **little** compared to adults. Alternate translation: “these children who believe in me” (2) a figurative reference to people whose faith is new and has not yet become mature and strong. Alternate translation: “these new believers” or (3) a figurative reference to people who are not important from a human perspective. Alternate translation: “these common people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
17:3	m104		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς	1	Since Jesus is teaching about how important it is not to sin and not to encourage others to sin, the implication is that this statement means that he wants his disciples to help one another not to sin. Alternate translation: “Help one another not to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:3	m105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	προσέχετε	1	The implied “you” in this imperative is plural, since Jesus is speaking to his disciples. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
17:3	m106		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σου & ἐπιτίμησον & ἄφες	1	The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperatives **rebuke** and **forgive** are singular, since Jesus is addressing an individual situation, even though he is speaking to a group. If these singular forms would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
17:3	hyn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ἁμάρτῃ ὁ ἀδελφός σου, ἐπιτίμησον αὐτῷ	1	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place. Alternate translation: “Suppose a fellow believer were to sin. Then you should rebuke him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
17:3	kkp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ ἀδελφός σου	1	Jesus is using the term **brother** figuratively to mean someone who shares the same faith. Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
17:3	m107		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ὁ ἀδελφός σου	1	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “a fellow believer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
17:3	p35i			ἐπιτίμησον αὐτῷ	1	Alternate translation: “correct him” or “tell him strongly that what he did was wrong”
17:3	m108		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	καὶ ἐὰν μετανοήσῃ, ἄφες αὐτῷ	1	Jesus is describing another hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “And suppose that believer were to repent. Then you should forgive him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
17:4	x8a3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ἑπτάκις τῆς ἡμέρας ἁμαρτήσῃ εἰς σὲ, καὶ ἑπτάκις ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς σὲ, λέγων μετανοῶ, ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	Jesus is describing a hypothetical situation in order to tell his disciples what they should do if it takes place. Alternate translation: “Suppose a fellow believer were to sin against you seven times in the same day. And suppose each time he came to you and said, ‘I am sorry.’ Then you would have to forgive him each time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
17:4	k5va		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἑπτάκις τῆς ἡμέρας & καὶ ἑπτάκις	1	The number **seven** in the Bible figuratively represents a large or sufficient quantity. Alternate translation: “many times in the same day, and each time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
17:4	m109			τῆς ἡμέρας	1	Alternate translation: “in the same day”
17:4	m110		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σὲ & σὲ & ἀφήσεις	1	The word **you** is singular in this verse, since Jesus is addressing an individual situation, even though he is speaking to a group. If these singular forms would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use plural forms in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
17:4	m111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐπιστρέψῃ πρὸς σὲ, λέγων μετανοῶ, ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “comes to you and says that he is sorry, you must forgive him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
17:4	m112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	ἀφήσεις αὐτῷ	1	Jesus is using a future statement to give an instruction and command. Alternate translation: “you must forgive him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
17:5	s4dy			οἱ ἀπόστολοι	1	This means the 12 disciples whom Jesus appointed as his authoritative representatives in [6:13](../06/13.md). See how you translated the term there.
17:5	m114			τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	Here Luke is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
17:5	pji3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	πρόσθες ἡμῖν πίστιν	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give us more faith” or “Please help us to trust God better” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
17:6	m115			ὁ Κύριος	1	Here Luke is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”

He is asserting that if the condition is true, then the result will necessarily follow. Alternate translation: “I can assure you that if you had faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
17:6	m117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ἔχετε & ἐλέγετε & ὑμῖν	1	Even though Jesus is describing something that an individual might do, **you** is plural in this verse because he is speaking to his 12 apostles in response to their request. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
17:6	ep7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	εἰ ἔχετε πίστιν ὡς κόκκον σινάπεως	1	A **mustard seed** is a very small seed. Jesus is using this seed figuratively in a simile to mean a very small amount. Alternate translation: “If you had even a tiny amount of faith” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
17:6	m118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κόκκον σινάπεως	1	If your readers would not be familiar with a **mustard seed**, you could use the name of another small seed with which they would be familiar, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a very small seed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:6	i31l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	συκαμίνῳ	1	Jesus likely uses a **mulberry tree** as an example because it has an extensive root system that makes it very difficult to uproot. If your readers would not be familiar with this tree, you could use the name of another type of tree with extensive roots that they would be familiar with, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “firmly rooted tree” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:6	m119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐλέγετε ἂν τῇ συκαμίνῳ ταύτῃ, ἐκριζώθητι καὶ φυτεύθητι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you could tell this mulberry tree to pull its roots out of the ground and put them down in the sea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
17:6	ky7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκριζώθητι καὶ φυτεύθητι ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs. Alternate translation: “Uproot yourself and plant yourself in the sea” or “Take your roots out of the ground and put them down into the sea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
17:6	g53n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑπήκουσεν ἂν ὑμῖν	1	Here, **listen to** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “the tree would obey you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
17:7	dk3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν δοῦλον ἔχων, ἀροτριῶντα ἢ ποιμαίνοντα, ὃς εἰσελθόντι ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, εὐθέως παρελθὼν ἀνάπεσε?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But none of you who had a servant who was out plowing or tending sheep would say to him when he came in from the field, ‘Come immediately and recline to eat’!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
17:7	m120		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	τίς δὲ ἐξ ὑμῶν δοῦλον ἔχων, ἀροτριῶντα ἢ ποιμαίνοντα, ὃς εἰσελθόντι ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, εὐθέως παρελθὼν ἀνάπεσε?	1	Jesus is using an illustration that involves a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose one of you had a servant who was out plowing or tending sheep. You would not say to him when he came in from the field, ‘Come immediately and recline to eat.’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:7	m121		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἰσελθόντι ἐκ τοῦ ἀγροῦ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, εὐθέως παρελθὼν ἀνάπεσε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

17:7	va34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δοῦλον & ἀροτριῶντα ἢ ποιμαίνοντα	1	It may be helpful to say explicitly that the land and sheep hypothetically belong to the person who is being asked to consider what he would do in this situation. Alternate translation: “a servant who had been out plowing your land or taking care of your sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:7	m122		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνάπεσε	1	See how you translated this phrase in [5:29](../05/29.md). Alternate translation: “sit down to eat” or “sit down and have your supper” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:8	iw9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, ἑτοίμασον τί δειπνήσω, καὶ περιζωσάμενος διακόνει μοι, ἕως φάγω καὶ πίω; καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ?	1	Jesus uses a second question as a further teaching tool, to emphasize how a person actually would treat a servant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “he would certainly say to him, ‘Prepare something for me to eat, and then wrap your robe around your hips so you could serve me while I eat and drink, and after that you yourself can eat and drink’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
17:8	m123		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	οὐχὶ ἐρεῖ αὐτῷ, ἑτοίμασον τί δειπνήσω, καὶ περιζωσάμενος διακόνει μοι, ἕως φάγω καὶ πίω; καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he would certainly tell the servant to prepare something for him to eat, and then to wrap his robe around his hips so he could serve him while he ate and drank, and that only after doing that the servant himself could eat and drink” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
17:8	kr7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	περιζωσάμενος διακόνει μοι	1	See how you translated these phrases in [12:35](../12/35.md). Alternate translation: “wrap the lower part of your robe around your hips so that you can serve me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

17:8	m124		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	φάγεσαι καὶ πίεσαι σύ	1	The master is using a future statement to give permission. Alternate translation: “you may eat and drink” or “you may have your own supper” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
17:9	qs51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **does he?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Alternate translation: “Would he thank the servant for doing what he had been commanded to do?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
17:9	m125		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	The implicit answer to the question is “no.” Masters expect their servants to do what they command them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation, add an additional sentence: “No, a master would not do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:9	jn5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ, ὅτι ἐποίησεν τὰ διαταχθέντα?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants his disciples to reflect on the nature of the master-servant relationship in order to understand better how they should relate to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “A master would certainly not thank a servant for doing just what he had been commanded to do!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
17:9	m126			μὴ ἔχει χάριν τῷ δούλῳ	1	Alternate translation: “he does not need to thank the servant”

Alternate translation: “say that you are unworthy servants and that you have only what you ought to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
17:10	m130		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	δοῦλοι ἀχρεῖοί ἐσμεν, ὃ ὠφείλομεν ποιῆσαι πεποιήκαμεν	1	People who would say this would be speaking about themselves but not about God, to whom they would be speaking, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **we**, use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
17:10	dga7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	δοῦλοι ἀχρεῖοί ἐσμεν	1	This is an exaggeration that means the servants have not done anything worthy of praise or thanks or a special reward. Alternate translation: “We are unworthy servants” or “We have not done anything while serving you that deserves special thanks” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
17:10	m132			ὃ ὠφείλομεν ποιῆσαι πεποιήκαμεν	1	Alternate translation: “We have only done our duty”

17:12	i1sc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἳ ἔστησαν πόρρωθεν	1	The **lepers** were not reluctant to engage Jesus. Rather, this was a respectful gesture, since they were not allowed to approach other people. According to the law of Moses, they were ceremonially unclean for as long as they had a skin disease. Luke assumes that his readers will know that, but if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate it explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “They stood at a distance, as they were required to do because they were ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:13	l1j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνὴν	1	This idiom means that they spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “they called out in loud voices” or “they shouted out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
17:13	m134			αὐτοὶ ἦραν φωνὴν	1	If it would be unusual in your language for someone to speak as if a group of people had only one **voice**, you could use the plural form here. Alternate translation: “they called out in loud voices”
17:13	fsn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please have mercy on us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
17:13	m135		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλέησον ἡμᾶς	1	The ten lepers assume that Jesus will know that they are specifically asking to be healed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “please have mercy on us and heal us” or “please be merciful to us by healing us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:14	mrx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πορευθέντες ἐπιδείξατε ἑαυτοὺς τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν	1	People who had been lepers but who had been healed were required under the law of Moses to have the priests verify that fact. So the implication of this command is that Jesus is healing the men. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are healed. Now go and show yourselves to the priests so they can verify that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:14	m137		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in the episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
17:14	jpk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκαθαρίσθησαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God healed them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
17:14	m138		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκαθαρίσθησαν	1	Luke uses the term **cleansed** for the healing of these lepers because when they were healed, they were no longer ceremonially unclean. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God healed them and so they were no longer ceremonially unclean” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:15	tdt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἰδὼν ὅτι ἰάθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

17:17	m140		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus spoke in response to the Samaritan man coming back to thank him.

17:17	hfa2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Jesus responded to what the man did, but he did so by speaking about the man to the group of people around him, rather than to the man directly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said to the crowd” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:17	m141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐχὶ οἱ δέκα ἐκαθαρίσθησαν?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action.

Alternate translation: “I know that I healed ten men of their leprosy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
17:17	w8y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οἱ δὲ ἐννέα ποῦ?	1	Jesus is not asking the crowd to tell him where the other nine men are. He is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “Was this foreigner the only one who returned to give glory to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
17:18	rxh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχ εὑρέθησαν ὑποστρέψαντες δοῦναι δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ, εἰ μὴ ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος?	1	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis.

17:18	x64q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἀλλογενὴς οὗτος	1	Samaritans had non-Jewish ancestors, and they did not worship God in the same way that the Jews did. The implication is that some of the lepers in the group were Jews, and Jesus would have expected them to return to give thanks to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “this foreigner, when the Jewish men should certainly have returned to thank God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Since all ten of the lepers were healed, but only this man demonstrated that he believed, Jesus seems to be saying that beyond being healed, he received salvation through faith. Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have received salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:19	m146		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of the leper’s **faith** as if it had actively saved him. Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have received salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God is inside of you” (2) since the word **you** is plural here, Jesus may be saying that the kingdom is not coming with observable signs because it is a matter of something that happens within communities of people. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God is in your midst” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

17:31	i9eq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ὃς ἔσται ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ, μὴ καταβάτω ἆραι αὐτά	1	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone is doing something on the roof of his house. Then he should not go inside to get his valuables” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:31	ep81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος	1	In this culture, housetops were flat and people could go up onto them without being in danger of sliding off. Housetops were used for a variety of purposes, such as storing and ripening grain and fruit, sleeping in hot weather, and gathering in a large open space. If housetops or roofs are different in your culture and your readers would not understand that Jesus is speaking of someone doing an ordinary activity, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “doing something outside the house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:31	jj9c			τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “his possessions” or “his valuables”
17:31	m180		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ καταβάτω ἆραι αὐτά	1	The implication is that people should flee immediately without even taking the time to secure their valuables. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he should flee immediately, without going inside to get his valuables” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:31	m181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	καὶ ὁ ἐν ἀγρῷ, ὁμοίως μὴ ἐπιστρεψάτω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. Alternate translation: “Suppose someone is out working in the field. Then he too should not go back into the house for anything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:31	suh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ ἐπιστρεψάτω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	The implication once again is that people should flee immediately without even taking the time to secure their valuables. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he should flee immediately, without going back to the house to get his valuables” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:32	fz8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μνημονεύετε τῆς γυναικὸς Λώτ	1	Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that Lot’s **wife** looked back toward Sodom and that God punished her along with the people of Sodom. Alternate translation: “Remember what happened to Lot’s wife when she looked back toward Sodom” or “Do not do what Lot’s wife did and wish you were back among people whom God is punishing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:32	m182		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Λώτ	1	**Lot** is the name of a man. See how you translated his name in [17:28](../17/28.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
17:33	d9fl			ὃς ἐὰν ζητήσῃ τὴν ψυχὴν αὐτοῦ περιποιήσασθαι, ἀπολέσει αὐτήν	1	Alternate translation: “Whoever tries to save his old way of living will lose his life”
17:33	kvw6			ὃς δ’ ἂν ἀπολέσει, ζῳογονήσει αὐτήν	1	Alternate translation: “but whoever gives up his old way of living will save his life”
17:34	p84l			λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Alternate translation: “Indeed”
17:34	j3b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ ἔσονται δύο ἐπὶ κλίνης μιᾶς	1	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose this were to happen at night, and suppose there were two people sleeping in the same bed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:34	at99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ κλίνης μιᾶς	1	If your readers would not be familiar with what a **bed** is, you could use the name of the sleeping furniture that people in your own culture use, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “sleeping on one mat” or “sleeping side by side” or “sleeping in the same place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:34	e9hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ εἷς παραλημφθήσεται, καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you could state who would do the actions. This could mean: (1) the person who is **taken** may be one whom God takes out of a situation in which they would be destroyed, as God brought Lot out of Sodom, and the person who is **left** may be one who remains in a situation where they will be destroyed, like the people who remained in Sodom. That is the interpretation of UST. Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” (2) in the parallel to this passage in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says that the people living in Noah’s time “knew nothing until the flood came and took them all away” (Matthew 24:39 ULT). So the person who is **taken** may actually be one whom God destroys, and the one who is **left** may be one whom God spares and allows to remain alive. Alternate translation: “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
17:34	m183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ὁ εἷς παραλημφθήσεται	1	If you translated the first sentence in this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this sentence as the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:35	il9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἔσονται δύο ἀλήθουσαι ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose that when this happens, two women are grinding grain together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:35	m184			δύο	1	The verb is feminine, so this means “two women.” (In [17:34](../17/34.md) and [17:36](../17/36.md), grammatically masculine forms are used, but conventionally in Greek that means that the people are not known to be all women; they could be men or women, so a general term such as “people” would be appropriate in those verses.) Alternate translation: “two women”
17:35	t4zn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀλήθουσαι	1	The term **grinding** refers to the process of breaking up grain into very small pieces so that it can be used for cooking. If your readers would not be familiar with grain, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “grinding grain” or “preparing food” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:35	m185		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ μία παραλημφθήσεται, ἡ δὲ ἑτέρα ἀφεθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you could state who would do the actions. See how you decided to translate this in [17:34](../17/34.md). Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” or “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
17:35	m186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἡ μία παραλημφθήσεται	1	If you translated the first sentence in this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this sentence as the result of that condition. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:36	m187		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	δύο ἐν ἀγρῷ εἰς παραληφθήσεται καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The notes below discuss translation issues in the verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
17:36	m188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	δύο ἐν ἀγρῷ	1	Jesus is speaking of a hypothetical situation that might occur at this time. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Suppose that when this happens, two people are out working in a field” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:36	m189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	εἰς παραληφθήσεται καὶ ὁ ἕτερος ἀφεθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use active forms for both of these verbs, and you could state who would do the actions. See how you decided to translate this in [17:34](../17/34.md). Alternate translation: “God will spare one of them but destroy the other” or “God will destroy one of them but spare the other” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
17:36	m190		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰς παραληφθήσεται	1	If you translated the beginning of this verse as the condition of a hypothetical situation, translate this as the result of that condition, as a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Then one of them will be taken” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
17:37	m191			ἀποκριθέντες λέγουσιν αὐτῷ	1	To convey the vividness and immediacy of the disciples’ question, Luke uses the present tense in past narration here. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “the disciples responded to him”
17:37	m192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθέντες λέγουσιν αὐτῷ	1	Together the two words **answering** and **say** mean that the disciples responded to what Jesus had been telling them by asking him a question about it. Alternate translation: “the disciples responded to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
17:37	wmg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποῦ, Κύριε	1	The implication is that the disciples are asking where the things that Jesus has been describing will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Lord, where will these things happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
17:37	fen1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	ὅπου τὸ σῶμα, ἐκεῖ καὶ οἱ ἀετοὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	Jesus may be quoting a popular proverb of the time. Alternate translation: “The location will be obvious from the things that you see happening there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
17:37	m193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅπου τὸ σῶμα, ἐκεῖ καὶ οἱ ἀετοὶ ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	In this proverb, **the body** and **the vultures** are figurative. If you would like to present the same image to your readers but your language does not use metaphors, you can express this as a simile. Alternate translation: “Just as vultures gather where there is a dead body, so the things I have described will indicate where this is about to happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
17:37	m6ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οἱ ἀετοὶ	1	The word **vultures** describes large birds that travel in flocks and eat the flesh of dead animals that they find. If your readers would not be familiar with **vultures**, you could use the name of similar birds in your area, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the scavenger birds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
17:37	m194		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπισυναχθήσονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will flock together” or “will assemble” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
18:intro	v92v				0	# Luke 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus tells a parable about a widow and a judge (18:1-8)\n2. Jesus tells a parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector (18:9-14)\n3. Jesus blesses little children (18:15-17)\n4. Jesus teaches about wealth and the kingdom of God (18:18-30)\n5. Jesus warns about his impending death (18:31-34)\n6. Jesus heals a blind man in Jericho (18:35-43)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Judges\n\nPeople expected judges always to do what God said was right and to make sure that other people did what was right. But some judges did not care about doing right or making sure others did right. Jesus called this kind of judge “unjust.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]])\n\n### Pharisees and tax collectors\n\nThe Pharisees thought that they themselves were the best examples of good, righteous people, and they thought that tax collectors were the most unrighteous of sinners. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “that he had become sad”\n\nAt the beginning of 18:24, in the story of the ruler who asked Jesus how he could have eternal life, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible say that Jesus saw “that he had become sad.” However, the ancient manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not have that phrase. They say simply that Jesus looked at him. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.\n\n### “we have left everything”\n\nIn 18:28, in some ancient manuscripts of the Bible, Peter says that the disciples have left “everything” to follow Jesus. In other manuscripts, the expression is “our own possessions.” ULT says “everything” in its text, but it acknowledges the variant “our own possessions” in a footnote.\n\nIn each of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
18:1	r26t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἔλεγεν δὲ παραβολὴν αὐτοῖς, πρὸς τὸ	1	Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told his disciples this story to help them understand that it was necessary” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
18:2	l2qr			λέγων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said”
18:2	ph5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	κριτής τις ἦν ἔν τινι πόλει	1	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce one of the main characters in this parable. Alternate translation: “There once was a judge who lived in a certain city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
18:2	d77j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	τὸν Θεὸν μὴ φοβούμενος καὶ ἄνθρωπον μὴ ἐντρεπόμενος	1	Jesus provides this background information about the **judge** to help his disciples understand what happens in the story. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He did not make his decisions based on what God wanted or on what other people thought” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
18:2	m195		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	Here, Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
18:3	ie2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	χήρα δὲ ἦν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the other main character into the story. Alternate translation: “There was also a woman who lived in that city whose husband had died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
18:3	jhk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χήρα	1	A widow is a woman whose husband has died and who has not remarried. Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that in this culture, she would have had no one to protect her from anyone who was trying to take advantage of her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a woman whose husband had died, and so she had no one to protect her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:3	xfg3			ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτὸν	1	Here the Greek verb indicates repeated or continual action. Alternate translation: “she kept coming to the judge”
18:3	m131		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγουσα, ἐκδίκησόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and asking him to make a fair ruling in her case against her opponent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
18:3	kj2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἐκδίκησόν με ἀπὸ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	This is an imperative, but since the woman is not in a position to make a demand, it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please give me a fair ruling in my case against my opponent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
18:3	xc7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τοῦ ἀντιδίκου μου	1	The term **opponent** refers specifically to the opposing party in a lawsuit. It is not clear whether the widow is suing the man to protect her interests, or the man is suing the widow to try to take things from her unfairly. If your language has a specific term for a legal adversary, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
18:4	m197			μετὰ ταῦτα	1	Alternate translation: “later on” or “eventually”
18:4	m198		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν ἐν ἑαυτῷ, εἰ καὶ τὸν Θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “he decided that even though he did not make his decisions based on what God wanted or on what other people thought” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
18:4	m199		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ καὶ τὸν Θεὸν οὐ φοβοῦμαι οὐδὲ ἄνθρωπον ἐντρέπομαι	1	The judge speaks as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the judge is saying is not actually the case, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Even though I do not make my decisions based on what God wants or on what other people think” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
18:4	bh3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	The judge is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
18:5	m200		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	διά γε τὸ παρέχειν μοι κόπον τὴν χήραν ταύτην, ἐκδικήσω αὐτήν, ἵνα μὴ εἰς τέλος ἐρχομένη ὑπωπιάζῃ με	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation (continuing the sentence from the previous verse): “because this widow bothered him, he would give a fair ruling in her case, so that she would not wear him out by coming incessantly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
18:5	v9uu			παρέχειν μοι κόπον	1	Alternate translation: “bothers me”
18:5	cf4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ & ὑπωπιάζῃ με	1	The judge speaks figuratively of the wearying effect of the widow’s constant pleas as if they were physically pummeling him. Alternate translation: “she will not wear me out” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
18:5	ub29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς τέλος ἐρχομένη	1	The expression **to the end** is an idiom that means “perpetually” or “forever.” Alternate translation: “by coming to me incessantly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
18:6	m201			ὁ Κύριος	1	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the respectful title **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
18:6	t9mg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀκούσατε τί ὁ κριτὴς τῆς ἀδικίας λέγει	1	**Listen to** is an idiom that means “think about.” Jesus says this to get his disciples to reflect on what the judge said at the end of the parable. He is not introducing a further statement from the judge. Translate this in such a way that your readers will understand that Jesus has already related what the judge said. Alternate translation: “Think about what the unjust judge said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
18:7	t1sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὁ δὲ Θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis as he teaches his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “Now God will certainly answer the prayers of the people he has chosen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
18:7	e2lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ δὲ Θεὸς οὐ μὴ ποιήσῃ τὴν ἐκδίκησιν τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus is drawing an implicit comparison between the unrighteous human judge and **God**, who is the perfectly righteous divine judge. The implication is that if even the human judge would ensure justice for someone who persevered in pleading for it, God would certainly do so. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “If an unrighteous human judge would ensure justice for someone who persevered in pleading for it, God will certainly answer the prayers of the people he has chosen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:7	lrs0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **elect** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “for the people whom he chose” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
18:7	m202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	τῶν βοώντων αὐτῷ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός	1	Jesus is using the phrase **day and night** figuratively to describe all of time, by referring to its two components. Alternate translation: “who pray to him all the time” or “who ask him for help continually” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
18:7	ljb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καὶ μακροθυμεῖ ἐπ’ αὐτοῖς	1	Here Jesus may be using the word **and** in an idiomatic sense to mean “even if.” (UST offers another possible interpretation of this phrase.) Alternate translation: “even if he takes a long time to answer their prayers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
18:8	m203			λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
18:8	m204		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποιήσει τὴν ἐκδίκησιν αὐτῶν ἐν τάχει	1	The point of the parable and of this teaching is that people should continue to pray even if God does not answer right away. So this statement might seem contradictory, since it suggests that God will answer right away. The implication may be that God is concerned for his people and will begin to act immediately to help them, even if his actions do not become apparent for some time. If you think your readers would be puzzled or troubled by the apparent contradiction, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he will start to answer their prayers right away” or “he will begin to send them help right away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:8	zi1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πλὴν ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν, ἆρα εὑρήσει τὴν πίστιν ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς?	1	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. This particular question uses a word that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, it is doubtful that the Son of Man will find faith on the earth when he returns.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
18:8	m205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πλὴν	1	The reference of this word is implied in the context. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “Even though God readily answers prayer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:8	inw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν	1	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “when I, the Son of Man, come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
18:8	m206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου ἐλθὼν	1	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “when I, the Messiah, come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:8	m207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν πίστιν	1	When Jesus asks whether he will find **faith** on the earth, he may be referring implicitly to the kind of persevering trust in God that would lead a person to continue praying even when the answer was delayed. (UST offers another possible interpretation of this word.) Alternate translation: “this kind of persevering faith” or “this kind of persevering trust in God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:9	n2b5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	εἶπεν δὲ καὶ πρός τινας & τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	Jesus now tells a brief story to correct some wrong attitudes that he realized certain people had. The story is designed teach something that is true in a way that is easy to understand and remember. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus told this story to correct certain people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
18:9	pmp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	πρός τινας	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce some new characters, but he does not say specifically who these people were. (The story that Jesus tells suggests that they may have been Pharisees.) Alternate translation: “to some people who were there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

18:9	rs6q			καὶ ἐξουθενοῦντας τοὺς λοιποὺς	1	Alternate translation: “and who thought they were superior to other people”
18:10	m208		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄνθρωποι δύο	1	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the characters in this parable. Alternate translation: “Once there were two men who” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
18:10	m209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνέβησαν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν προσεύξασθαι	1	When Jesus says that these men **went up**, he likely means that they traveled to Jerusalem. That was the customary way of speaking about going there, since the city was up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “went to pray in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
18:10	qp39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	Since only priests could enter the **temple** building, this means the **temple** courtyard. Jesus is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
18:10	m210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὁ εἷς Φαρισαῖος καὶ ὁ ἕτερος τελώνης	1	Jesus provides this background information to help his listeners understand what happens in the story.

18:11	mi9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ταῦτα πρὸς ἑαυτὸν προσηύχετο, ὁ Θεός, εὐχαριστῶ σοι ὅτι οὐκ εἰμὶ ὥσπερ οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, ἅρπαγες, ἄδικοι, μοιχοί, ἢ καὶ ὡς οὗτος ὁ τελώνης	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “prayed about himself and thanked God that he was not like other people, who were robbers, unrighteous, and adulterers, or even like the tax collector who was there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
18:11	m211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	εὐχαριστῶ σοι	1	Here, the pronoun **you** is singular because the Pharisee is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of **you** that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form here. Alternatively, it might be effective to show this man addressing God using a familiar form, as if he could presume on God’s friendship and approval. Use your best judgment about what form to use. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
18:11	m212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ λοιποὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	The Pharisee is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

18:11	m213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄδικοι	1	The Pharisee is using the adjective **unrighteous** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “evildoers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
18:11	z78w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἢ καὶ ὡς οὗτος ὁ τελώνης	1	The Pharisees believed that any **tax collector** would be dishonest and cheat others, and so as a group they were as sinful as robbers, unrighteous people, and adulterers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly, as UST does. Alternate translation: “and I am certainly not like this sinful tax collector who cheats people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:12	m214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	νηστεύω δὶς τοῦ σαββάτου; ἀποδεκατεύω πάντα, ὅσα κτῶμαι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He boasted that he fasted twice a week and that he gave ten percent of all his income to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
18:12	ru63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀποδεκατεύω πάντα, ὅσα κτῶμαι	1	To **tithe** means to give ten percent of one’s income to God, as required in the law of Moses. Alternate translation: “I give you ten percent of all my income” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
18:13	c37t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ὁ δὲ τελώνης μακρόθεν ἑστὼς	1	This was a sign of humility. The **tax collector** did not feel worthy to be near the Pharisee and the other people in the temple courtyard. It may be helpful to make each of the phrases in this verse a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “But the tax collector humbly stood by himself, away from the other people who were there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
18:13	qtt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἤθελεν οὐδὲ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς ἐπᾶραι εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	The phrase **lift up his eyes** means to look at something. Alternate translation: “did not even want to look up toward heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
18:13	m215		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [9:16](../09/16.md). Alternate translation: “beyond the sky towards God in heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:13	c7x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἀλλ’ ἔτυπτε τὸ στῆθος αὐτοῦ	1	This was a physical expression of great sorrow, and it showed this man’s repentance and humility. Alternate translation: “Instead, he hit his chest to demonstrate his shame and sorrow over his sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
18:13	m216		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων, ὁ Θεός, ἱλάσθητί μοι, τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He admitted that he was a sinner and asked God to have mercy on him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
18:13	mx5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ὁ Θεός, ἱλάσθητί μοι, τῷ ἁμαρτωλῷ	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “God, please be merciful to me, I confess that I am a sinner” or “God, please forgive me for the many sins I have committed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
18:14	m217			λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell his disciples. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
18:14	s1yr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατέβη οὗτος δεδικαιωμένος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, παρ’ ἐκεῖνον	1	The implication is that the tax collector was right with God because God forgave his sin when he prayed humbly and repentantly. Alternate translation: “the tax collector was right with God when he went home, rather than the Pharisee, because God forgave his sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:14	m218			οὗτος & παρ’ ἐκεῖνον	1	Alternate translation: “the latter … rather than the former” or “the tax collector … rather than the Pharisee”
18:14	m219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δεδικαιωμένος	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of the passive verbal form **justified** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “right with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
18:14	m220		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κατέβη & εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1	When Jesus says that this man **went down** to his house, he likely means that he returned home from Jerusalem, since the city was up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “returned to his home” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
18:14	qrg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρ’ ἐκεῖνον	1	The implication is that the Pharisee was not right with God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “but the Pharisee was not right with God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:14	n7xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ταπεινωθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will humble” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
18:14	uuc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑψωθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will honor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
18:14	m221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑψωθήσεται	1	Jesus is using a spatial metaphor to describe someone who is honored as if he were high up. Alternate translation: “God will honor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
18:15	m260		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to begin relating a new event by introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens.

18:15	abcm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	προσέφερον & αὐτῷ καὶ τὰ βρέφη	1	Here, **they** refers to people in general. Alternate translation: “people were bringing their children to Jesus, even their newborns” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
18:15	m222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἵνα αὐτῶν ἅπτηται	1	If Jesus would **touch** the babies, this would express God’s love for them and convey God’s blessing to them. Alternate translation: “so that he could put his hands on them and bless them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
18:15	kxd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπετίμων αὐτοῖς	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “they tried to stop the parents from bringing their children to Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:16	y3qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς προσεκαλέσατο αὐτὰ λέγων	1	Alternate translation: “But Jesus called the children to come to him, telling his disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
18:16	j8x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	ἄφετε τὰ παιδία ἔρχεσθαι πρός με, καὶ μὴ κωλύετε αὐτά	1	The verb in the first phrase indicates a one-time action, while the verb in the second phrase indicates an ongoing action. Alternate translation: “Allow these children to come to me, and do not ever forbid children to come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
18:16	u7sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	τῶν & τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	It becomes clear in [18:17](../18/17.md) that this is simile. You could express it as one here. Alternate translation: “the kingdom of God consists of people who are like these little children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
18:16	m223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῶν & τοιούτων ἐστὶν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “people who are like children will let God rule their lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
18:17	p5lq			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν, ὃς ἂν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you that whoever”
18:17	m224		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	δέξηται τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “let God rule over him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
18:17	ar8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς παιδίον	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the basis of this comparison. Alternate translation: “with trust and humility like a child” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
18:17	m225			οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτήν	1	Alternate translation: “will not let God rule over him at all”
18:18	a5qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ ἐπηρώτησέν τις αὐτὸν ἄρχων	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. Alternate translation: “Then a Jewish leader came up to Jesus and asked him a question” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
18:18	d6kf			τί ποιήσας & κληρονομήσω	1	Alternate translation: “what do I need to do to inherit”
18:18	xrs8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κληρονομήσω	1	The ruler is using the term **inherit** figuratively to mean coming into possession of something. Alternate translation: “will I receive” or “will I obtain” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
18:19	fxi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1	Jesus is using the question form as a teaching tool. He is not asking the ruler to explain why he used this term. Jesus is also not denying that he is God. Rather, he is challenging the ruler to reflect on whether, in light of God’s holiness, he should consider any human being to be **good**. The ruler apparently considers Jesus to be a **good** human being, and he wants to know how he can be **good** enough himself to earn God’s approval. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement, and it may be helpful to combine that statement with the next sentence in the verse. Alternate translation: “You should not consider any human being to be good, since no one is good except God alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
18:20	m226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰς ἐντολὰς οἶδας	1	The implication is that Jesus is saying this in response to the ruler’s question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “As for what God expects from us, you know what he has commanded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
18:20	m227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	μὴ μοιχεύσῃς, μὴ φονεύσῃς, μὴ κλέψῃς, μὴ ψευδομαρτυρήσῃς, τίμα τὸν πατέρα σου καὶ τὴν μητέρα	1	You may wish to represent these commandments as a second-level direct quotation within Jesus’ reply to the ruler, using the capitalization and punctuation conventions of your language. That is what UST does. However, that would be a quotation within a quotation, and you may wish to avoid that by leaving the commandments as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
18:20	m261		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σου	1	Jesus is reciting these commandments from the Scriptures, and the word **your** is singular because that is the way Moses spoke the commandments, since even though he gave them to the Israelites as a group, each individual person was supposed to obey them. So in your translation, it would be appropriate to use the singular form of **your**. The implied **you** in the imperative verbs would also be singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
18:21	m5qf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ταῦτα πάντα ἐφύλαξα ἐκ νεότητος μου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **youth** with an adjective such as “young.” Alternate translation: “I have obeyed all of these commandments ever since I was young” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
18:22	e8il			ἀκούσας δὲ, ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	Alternate translation: “When Jesus heard the ruler say that, he responded”
18:22	t2cw			ἔτι ἕν σοι λείπει	1	Alternate translation: “You still need to do one more thing” or “There is one thing that you have not yet done”
18:22	d3ar			πάντα ὅσα ἔχεις, πώλησον	1	Alternate translation: “Sell all your possessions” or “Sell everything that you own”
18:22	c4s5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πτωχοῖς	1	Jesus is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are poor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
18:22	hy6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δεῦρο, ἀκολούθει μοι	1	As in [5:27](../05/27.md), to **follow** Jesus means to be one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “come with me as my disciple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
18:23	m228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ ἀκούσας ταῦτα & ἐγενήθη	1	Alternate translation: “But when the ruler heard what Jesus said, he said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
18:24	m229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἰδὼν δὲ αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Many manuscripts have two additional Greek words here, so that this says, “Then Jesus, seeing him having become sad.” See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to represent those words in your translation. Alternate translation (if you choose to represent them): “Then Jesus, noticing how sad the ruler had become” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
18:24	qcm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	πῶς δυσκόλως οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες, εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσπορεύονται	1	This is an exclamation, not a question. Alternate translation: “It is so very difficult for those who are rich to enter the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
18:24	m230		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πῶς δυσκόλως οἱ τὰ χρήματα ἔχοντες, εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσπορεύονται	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “It is so very difficult for those who are rich to allow God to rule their lives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
18:25	hdz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	εὐκοπώτερον γάρ ἐστιν κάμηλον διὰ τρήματος βελόνης εἰσελθεῖν, ἢ	1	It is impossible for **a camel** to fit through **the eye of a needle** Jesus is using an exaggeration to express how difficult it is for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom. Alternate translation: “It is extremely difficult” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
18:25	m231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κάμηλον	1	A **camel** is a large animal that was used in this culture to transport people and goods. If your readers would not know what a **camel** is, you could use the name of a similar animal that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a huge beast of burden” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
18:25	j7x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τρήματος βελόνης	1	The **eye of a needle** is the hole in a sewing needle through which the thread is passed. If your language has an expression of its own that describes this hole, you could use it in your translation. Otherwise, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the tiny hole for thread in a needle” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
18:25	m232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσελθεῖν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [18:24](../18/24.md). Alternate translation: “to allow God to rule his life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
18:26	ycm3			οἱ ἀκούσαντες	1	Alternate translation: “the people who were listening to Jesus”
18:26	vu3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι?	1	It is possible that these people were asking for an answer. But it is more likely that they were using the question form to emphasize their surprise at what Jesus said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “Then no one can be saved!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
18:26	m233		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ τίς δύναται σωθῆναι?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could specify the agent. Alternate translation: “Then God is not going to save anyone!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
18:27	ms9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὰ ἀδύνατα παρὰ ἀνθρώποις, δυνατὰ παρὰ τῷ Θεῷ ἐστιν	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **impossible** and **possible** as nouns to describe types of things. The terms are plural. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these terms with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “The things that are impossible for people to do are possible for God to do” or “God is able to do the things that people are not able to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
18:28	m235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Peter uses the term **Behold** to get Jesus to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Listen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
18:28	znu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς ἀφήκαμεν & ἠκολουθήσαμέν	1	Peter is referring to himself and his fellow disciples, but not to Jesus, so if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **we**, use the exclusive form in both of these cases. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
18:28	yk9b			πάντα	1	This is not hyperbole. Peter and the others did leave behind **everything** they had in order to become Jesus’ disciples. Alternate translation: “all our possessions”
18:28	m236		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	πάντα	1	Some manuscripts say “our own possessions” here instead of “everything.” See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide which reading to use in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
18:28	m262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἠκολουθήσαμέν σοι	1	As in [18:22](../18/22.md), to follow Jesus means to be one of his disciples. Alternate translation: “in order to become your disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
18:29	vz2w			ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
18:29	sk6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν	1	A double negative statement begins in this verse and concludes in the next verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the entire double negative statement as a positive statement. Alternate translation, beginning here: “anyone who has left” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
18:29	m237		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἵνεκεν τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “in order to allow God to rule over his life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
18:30	s6rp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ὃς οὐχὶ μὴ ἀπολάβῃ	1	This is the conclusion of the double negative statement that began in the previous verse with “there is no one who has left.” If you started to translate it there as a positive statement, you could finish that translation here. Alternate translation: “will certainly receive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
18:30	m238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τούτῳ & ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ	1	Jesus is using the word **time** in the same figurative sense as the word **age** in [16:8](../16/08.md), to mean the long period of time defined by the duration of the created world; by association, it means the world itself. Here, Jesus is using the word **age** similarly to mean the new world that God will introduce after the end of this present world. Alternate translation: “in this present world … in the world to come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
18:30	d3xa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ, ζωὴν αἰώνιον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. you could supply these words from what he says earlier in the sentence.

18:33	fie4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ, ἀναστήσεται	1	See how you translated this phrase in [9:22](../09/22.md). In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the **third day**. To make sure that this is clear to your readers, you may wish to use a different expression than “the third day,” especially if, in your culture, this would mean one day longer than Jesus intends. Otherwise, your readers may be confused when they read later in the book that Jesus died on a Friday and came back to life on a Sunday, if that would be “the second day” according to the way your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “and he will spend the next full day in the grave, but on the day after that, he will come back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

18:38	u9ct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses **and** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described.

18:38	m250		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Υἱὲ Δαυείδ	1	The blind man is using the word **Son** figuratively to mean “descendant.” Alternate translation: “Descendant of David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
18:38	ehf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Υἱὲ Δαυείδ	1	**David** was Israel’s most important king, and God had promised him that one of his descendants would be the Messiah. So the title **Son of David** implicitly meant “Messiah.” Alternate translation: “Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please be merciful to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
18:38	m252		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλέησόν με	1	The blind man assumes that Jesus will know that he is asking specifically to be healed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly.

18:41	al8g			ἵνα ἀναβλέψω	1	Alternate translation: “I want to be able to see again” or “I want you to restore my sight”
18:42	n67h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἀνάβλεψον	1	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I have restored your sight” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
18:42	m256		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** with a verb such as “believe.” Alternate translation: “Because you believed, you have been healed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

18:43	m258			ἠκολούθει αὐτῷ	1	Here, **followed** does not necessarily have the figurative meaning of “became a disciple.” Alternate translation: “he walked down the road with the rest of the crowd that was around Jesus”

19:intro	zn2b				0	# Luke 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus helps a man named Zacchaeus repent of his sins (19:1-10)\n2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who entrusted money to his servants (19:11-27)\n3. Jesus rides into Jerusalem on a colt (19:28-48)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Sinner”\n\nThe Pharisees refer to a group of people as “sinners.” The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### Servants\n\nGod expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not.\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that the disciples brought Jesus both a donkey and a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: Matthew 21:1-7 and Mark 11:1-7 and Luke 19:29-36 and John 12:14-15)\n\n### Spreading garments and branches\n\nWhen kings would enter the cities they ruled, people would cut branches from trees and take off the outer garments that they wore to stay warm in cold weather and spread them all on the road so the king would ride over them. They did this to honor the king and show that they loved him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/honor]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])\n\n### The merchants in the temple\n\nJesus forced the people who were selling animals in the temple to leave. He did this to show everyone that he had authority over the temple and that only those who were righteous, who did what God said was good, could be in it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])
19:1	j35m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to begin relating a new event by introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
19:1	m259		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰερειχώ	1	**Jericho** is the name of a city. See how you translated **Jericho** in [18:35](../18/35.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
19:2	m263		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
19:2	y5i5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀνὴρ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a man who lived there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
19:2	m264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὀνόματι καλούμενος Ζακχαῖος	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “whose name was Zacchaeus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
19:2	m265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ζακχαῖος	1	**Zacchaeus** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
19:2	z91v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ αὐτὸς ἦν ἀρχιτελώνης, καὶ αὐτὸς πλούσιος	1	Luke provides this background information about Zacchaeus to help readers understand what happens in this episode. Alternate translation: “who had become wealthy through his work as a chief tax collector” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
19:3	m3ux			ἐζήτει ἰδεῖν τὸν Ἰησοῦν τίς ἐστιν	1	Alternate translation: “Zacchaeus was trying to get a good look at Jesus” or “Zacchaeus was trying to see what kind of man Jesus was”
19:3	njt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐκ ἠδύνατο ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου, ὅτι τῇ ἡλικίᾳ μικρὸς ἦν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because he was short, he could not see over the crowd” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
19:3	m266		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἠδύνατο ἀπὸ τοῦ ὄχλου, ὅτι τῇ ἡλικίᾳ μικρὸς ἦν	1	The implication may be that the people resented Zacchaeus for taking their money, and so they would not let him come forward and stand in front of them, even though they would have been able to see over him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he could not see over the crowd because he was short, and the people would not let him stand in the front, because they resented him for taking their money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:4	k984		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
19:4	pzr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	συκομορέαν	1	This is a type of fig tree. It would have been tall enough and strong enough to hold Zacchaeus at a height from which he could see the street. If you readers would not be familiar with this particular tree, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a fig tree” or “a tree” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
19:5	mr51			ὡς ἦλθεν ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον	1	Alternate translation: “when Jesus got to that tree” or “when Jesus reached the place where Zacchaeus was”
19:6	zrw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
19:7	mit4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες διεγόγγυζον	1	Luke is using the term **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd complained” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
19:7	k2cl			παρὰ ἁμαρτωλῷ ἀνδρὶ εἰσῆλθεν καταλῦσαι	1	Alternate translation: “Jesus is going to stay in the house of an obvious sinner”
19:7	yl4h			ἁμαρτωλῷ ἀνδρὶ	1	By using two terms together, rather than simply saying “sinner,” the crowd is emphasizing that Zacchaeus has openly done many wrong things. Alternate translation: “an obvious sinner”
19:8	m267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	σταθεὶς	1	At a relaxed meal such as this one, it was the custom in this culture for host and guests to eat while lying down comfortably around the table. So by standing up, Zacchaeus was signifying that he had something important to say. Alternate translation: “stood up from the meal to speak” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
19:8	s46z			τὸν Κύριον	1	Here Luke refers to Jesus by the respectful title **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus”
19:8	m268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Zacchaeus uses **behold** to get Jesus to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “Please listen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
19:8	m269			Κύριε	1	Zacchaeus is addressing Jesus directly by a respectful title. It would be appropriate to represent the title with the corresponding term in your language and culture, rather than using the name “Jesus.”
19:8	m270		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ τινός τι ἐσυκοφάντησα, ἀποδίδωμι τετραπλοῦν	1	Zacchaeus speaks as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. He is inviting anyone he has cheated to come to him for restitution. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Zacchaeus is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “I know that I have cheated many people out of their money, and I promise to pay each one back four times as much” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
19:8	u2bt			ἀποδίδωμι τετραπλοῦν	1	Alternate translation: “I will return to them four times as much as I took from them”
19:9	m271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτὸν ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Jesus spoke not just to Zacchaeus but also to the people from the crowd who were complaining that he had gone to visit him. In this culture, people were allowed to stand around the walls of the banquet room in a private home and listen to what an invited guest was saying. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then Jesus said to Zacchaeus and to the people from the crowd who were standing around the room” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:9	m272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο, καθότι καὶ αὐτὸς υἱὸς Ἀβραάμ ἐστιν	1	Jesus is speaking to Zacchaeus, but he addresses him in the third person because he is also speaking to the people from the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the second person here. Alternate translation: “salvation has come to your household, because you too are a son of Abraham” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
19:9	m273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of **salvation** as if it were a living thing that could come to the house of Zacchaeus.

19:9	u2bx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σωτηρία τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ ἐγένετο	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **salvation** with a verb such as “save,” and show that God has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has saved this household” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
19:9	i8yg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ οἴκῳ τούτῳ	1	Jesus is using the word **house** figuratively to refer to the people living in the house. Alternate translation: “to this household” or “to this family” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

19:47	mn6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
19:47	m345		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ πρῶτοι τοῦ λαοῦ	1	Luke is using the adjective **first** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. The term is plural. Alternate translation: “the leaders of the people” or “many prominent people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
19:47	m346		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ πρῶτοι τοῦ λαοῦ	1	The term **first** figuratively represents being significant or important. Alternate translation: “the leaders of the people” or “many prominent people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
19:48	m347		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce a contrast between what the Jewish leaders were trying to do and what they were able to do. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
19:48	m348			οὐχ εὕρισκον τὸ τί ποιήσωσιν	1	Alternate translation: “they were not able to find a way to kill Jesus”
19:48	m349		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὁ λαὸς & ἅπας	1	Luke is using the term **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “so many of the people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
19:48	pnf9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξεκρέμετο αὐτοῦ ἀκούων	1	Luke speaks figuratively of the people **hanging** on Jesus to emphasize how closely they were listening to what he said. Alternate translation: “were paying close attention to him to hear what he was saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:intro	h6in				0	# Luke 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus answers a question about his authority (20:1-8)\n2. Jesus tells a parable about a man who rented a vineyard to farmers (20:9-19)\n3. Jesus answers a question about paying taxes to Caesar (20:20-26)\n4. Jesus answers a question about marriage and the resurrection (20:27-40)\n5. Jesus asks a challenging question about the Messiah (20:41-44)\n6. Jesus warns about the scribes (20:45-47)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in [20:17](../20/17.md) and [20:42-43](../20/42.md), which is quoted from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Questions that seem to have no good answer\n\nIn [20:4](../20/04.md), Jesus asks the Pharisees a question that seems to have no good answer. His goal is to show them that they should have recognized John the Baptist as someone who came with God’s authority. So he asks them who gave John the authority to baptize. They could not answer, because any answer they gave would show that they should have respected John [20:5-6](../20/05.md).\n\nIn [20:22](../20/22.md), the Pharisees ask Jesus a question that seems to have no good answer. They thought that they would get Jesus in trouble either with the Roman government or the Jewish people when they asked him if people should pay taxes to Caesar. If he said “yes,” then the Jewish people would be angry with him for telling them to pay taxes to a foreign government. If he said “no,” then the religious leaders could tell the Romans that Jesus was teaching the people to break the Roman laws. But Jesus gave them an answer they had not anticipated, and instead everyone respected the wisdom of Jesus even more.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a psalm that records David calling his son “lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants, so a father would not call his son “master.” In this passage, [Luke 20:41-44](../20/41.md), Jesus is trying to lead his hearers to the true understanding that the Messiah will be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. So David is speaking to his son, that is, his descendant, as the Messiah, and it is appropriate for him to address him as his “Lord.”
20:1	h8gv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
20:1	vtg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Only priests were allowed to enter the **temple** building, so Luke means that Jesus was teaching in the temple courtyard. Luke is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
20:1	m350		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἐπέστησαν οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ γραμματεῖς σὺν τοῖς πρεσβυτέροις	1	Luke uses this statement to reintroduce these characters into the story. He mentioned their activity in opposition to Jesus as background information in [19:47-48](../19/47.md), but here he brings them back into the main action of the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
20:2	m351		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	εἰπὸν ἡμῖν ἐν ποίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ ταῦτα ποιεῖς, ἢ τίς ἐστιν ὁ δούς σοι τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην	1	The Jewish leaders are using an imperative to ask a question, so you could translate this as a question. It may be helpful to make it two sentences. Alternate translation: “Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? Or who is the one who gave you this authority?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
20:3	qn89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς & εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus said what follows in response to the question from the Jewish leaders. Alternate translation: “he responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
20:3	ku6a			ἐρωτήσω ὑμᾶς κἀγὼ λόγον καὶ εἴπατέ μοι	1	Jesus begins his response with a statement, but then he gives a command, **you say to me**. It might be helpful to make the statement one sentence and the command another sentence, leading into the next verse. Alternate translation: “I will also ask you a question. Now you tell me”
20:3	m352			λόγον	1	Here Jesus is using the term **word** in a specific sense. Alternate translation: “a question”
20:4	uph3			τὸ βάπτισμα Ἰωάννου, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἦν ἢ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων?	1	Jesus knows that John’s authority came from God, so he is not asking the Jewish leaders for information. However, this is not a rhetorical question that could be translated as a statement, for example, “Surely you must admit that God, not people, gave John the authority to baptize.” This is an actual question that Jesus wants the Jewish leaders to try to answer, because he knows that either way they answer, they will have a problem. So his words should be translated as a question. Alternate translation: “Was it God who told John to baptize people, or did people tell him to do it?”
20:4	z7cg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ἐξ οὐρανοῦ	1	In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying the word “God” and used the word **heaven** instead. That seems to be what Jesus is doing here. Alternate translation: “from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
20:4	m353		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Here Jesus is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes all people. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
20:5	mn6x			οἱ & συνελογίσαντο πρὸς ἑαυτοὺς	1	Alternate translation: “they discussed with each other what they should say”
20:5	m354		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐὰν εἴπωμεν, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, ἐρεῖ, διὰ τί οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ	1	The Jewish leaders are describing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose we say, ‘From heaven.’ Then he will ask, ‘Then why did you not believe him’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
20:5	z599		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐὰν εἴπωμεν, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ, ἐρεῖ, διὰ τί οὐκ ἐπιστεύσατε αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “If we say that John’s authority came from God, Jesus will ask us why we did not believe him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:5	m4l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ἐξ οὐρανοῦ	1	See how you translated this expression in [20:4](../20/04.md). Alternate translation: “From God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
20:6	m355		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐὰν δὲ εἴπωμεν, ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, ὁ λαὸς ἅπας καταλιθάσει ἡμᾶς	1	The Jewish leaders are describing another hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “But suppose we say, ‘From men.’ Then all the people will stone us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
20:6	e9ps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐὰν δὲ εἴπωμεν, ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, ὁ λαὸς ἅπας καταλιθάσει ἡμᾶς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But if we say that John’s authority came from people, then all the people will stone us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:6	m356		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	See how you translated **men** in [20:4](../20/04.md). Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
20:6	m357		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὁ λαὸς ἅπας	1	For emphasis, the Jewish leaders speak figuratively as if every single person in the Jewish nation believed that John was God’s prophet and would stone them if they said otherwise. Alternate translation: “many of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
20:6	m358		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ λαὸς	1	This was a customary way of speaking of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “the … Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
20:6	nns5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καταλιθάσει ἡμᾶς	1	The implication is that the people would do this as a punishment for blasphemy, for saying that one of God’s prophets had only human authority. Alternate translation: “kill us by throwing stones at us, as punishment for blasphemy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:6	m359		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πεπεισμένος & ἐστιν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. If you translated **the … people** as “the Jewish people,” this would be plural. Alternate translation: “they firmly believe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:7	ia28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentences described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
20:7	w2bc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἀπεκρίθησαν, μὴ εἰδέναι πόθεν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “they replied, ‘We do not know where it came from’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
20:7	eeg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πόθεν	1	Luke leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from [20:4](../20/04.md). Alternate translation: “where John’s authority to baptize came from” or “who gave John the authority to baptize people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
20:8	d3bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐδὲ ἐγὼ λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus is indicating that this is the result of what the Jewish leaders told him. Alternate translation: “Then I will not tell you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
20:9	mf5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἤρξατο δὲ πρὸς τὸν λαὸν λέγειν τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	To help the people understand what the Jewish leaders were doing by rejecting him and John the Baptist, Jesus tells a brief story that provides an illustration. Alternate translation: “Jesus told the people this story to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
20:9	m360		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄνθρωπος ἐφύτευσεν ἀμπελῶνα	1	Jesus uses this phrase to introduce the main character into the story. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who planted a vineyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
20:9	s8tt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐξέδετο αὐτὸν γεωργοῖς	1	As the rest of the story shows, the man **rented** the vineyard not for regular cash payments, but under an arrangement that entitled him to a share of the crop in exchange for the use of the land. If an arrangement like that would not be familiar to your readers, you could translate this in a way that explains it. Alternate translation: “allowed some grape farmers to use it in exchange for a share of the crop” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
20:9	y37s			γεωργοῖς	1	While **farmers** is a general term for anyone who farms the ground, in this context it refers to people who tend grape vines and grow grapes. Alternate translation: “vine growers” or “grape farmers”
20:10	wm51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καιρῷ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what time this was. Alternate translation: “at the time at which they had agreed to give him a share of the crop” or “at harvest time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:10	m361			γεωργοὺς & γεωργοὶ	1	See how you translated **farmers** in [20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: “vine growers” or “grape farmers”
20:10	kr7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπὸ τοῦ καρποῦ τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	The word **fruit** could be: (1) intended literally. Alternate translation: “some of the grapes they had grown” (2) figurative. Alternate translation: “some of what they had produced from the grapes they had grown” or “some of the money they had earned by selling their produce” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:10	m362		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ & γεωργοὶ ἐξαπέστειλαν αὐτὸν, δείραντες κενόν	1	It may be helpful to state explicitly that the farmers did this after the servant arrived, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:10	isk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξαπέστειλαν αὐτὸν & κενόν	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of this servant as if he were a container with nothing in it. Alternate translation: “sent him away without giving him anything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:11	r72a			ἀτιμάσαντες	1	Alternate translation: “humiliated him”
20:11	vxh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξαπέστειλαν κενόν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [20:10](../20/10.md). Alternate translation: “sent him away without giving him anything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:12	m363		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τρίτον	1	Jesus is using the adjective **third** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could specify the person. Alternate translation: “a third servant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
20:12	lr3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τρίτον	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “servant number three” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
20:12	ub4g			οἱ & καὶ τοῦτον τραυματίσαντες	1	Alternate translation: “they injured that servant as well”
20:12	h32a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξέβαλον	1	Jesus is likely speaking figuratively when he says that the farmers **threw** this servant out of the vineyard. It is unlikely that they actually picked him up and heaved him through the air. Alternate translation: “chased him off the property” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:13	m364			ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	Alternate translation: “the owner of the vineyard” or “the man who had planted the vineyard”
20:13	kt8i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν & τί ποιήσω? πέμψω τὸν υἱόν μου τὸν ἀγαπητόν; ἴσως τοῦτον ἐντραπήσονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “asked himself what he should do. He decided to send his beloved son, hoping that the farmers would respect him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:13	m365			ἴσως τοῦτον ἐντραπήσονται	1	In this context, the term that ULT translates as **perhaps** indicates something that is not certain but should be expected. If your language has a word or phrase that indicates the same thing, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “They ought to respect him”
20:14	ib2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰδόντες δὲ αὐτὸν, οἱ γεωργοὶ	1	It may be helpful to state explicitly that this happened after the owner sent his son and he arrived. Alternate translation: “So the owner sent his son. But when he arrived and the farmers saw him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:14	m366			οἱ γεωργοὶ	1	See how you translated **farmers** in [20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: “the vine growers” or “the grape farmers”
20:14	rvi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγοντες, οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ κληρονόμος; ἀποκτείνωμεν αὐτόν, ἵνα ἡμῶν γένηται ἡ κληρονομία	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “saying that the son was the owner’s heir, and that they should kill him in order to get for themselves the vineyard he would have inherited” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:14	m367		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἡ κληρονομία	1	By **inheritance**, the farmers mean the vineyard, which the son would inherit. Alternate translation: “this vineyard, which he is going to inherit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:15	u7us		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described.

20:15	m6en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐκβαλόντες αὐτὸν ἔξω τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	As in [20:12](../20/12.md), Jesus is likely speaking figuratively when he says that the farmers **threw** the son out of the vineyard, as if they heaved him through the air. Alternate translation: “the vine growers forced the son out of the vineyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:15	dlu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ποιήσει αὐτοῖς ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος?	1	Jesus does not want the people to tell him what the owner of the vineyard will do. Rather, he is using the question form to get his listeners to pay attention to what he says the owner will do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “So now, listen to what the lord of the vineyard will do to them.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
20:15	m368			ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος	1	Alternate translation: “the owner of the vineyard” or “the man who had planted the vineyard”
20:16	m369			τοὺς γεωργοὺς τούτους	1	See how you translated the term **farmers** in [20:9](../20/09.md). Your language might say “those” instead of **these** in a context like this. Alternate translation: “those vine growers” or “those grape farmers”
20:16	m370		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	δώσει τὸν ἀμπελῶνα ἄλλοις	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: “allow different grape farmers to use it in exchange for a share of the crop” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
20:16	k18g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	μὴ γένοιτο	1	This is an exclamation. Alternate translation: “May nothing like that ever happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
20:17	qtb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ὁ δὲ ἐμβλέψας αὐτοῖς εἶπεν	1	Jesus was **looking at** the people to hold them accountable for understanding what he was saying. Alternate translation: “But Jesus looked straight at them and said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
20:17	m371		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	τί οὖν ἐστιν τὸ γεγραμμένον τοῦτο, λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “What then does Scripture mean when it says that the stone that the builders rejected became the cornerstone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:17	rf5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ἐστιν τὸ γεγραμμένον τοῦτο	1	Jesus does not expect the people to explain the meaning of the scripture he is quoting. Rather, he is using the question form to get them to consider its implications carefully. Alternate translation: “Think carefully about what this scripture is saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
20:17	l6l3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ γεγραμμένον τοῦτο	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this passive verbal form with a noun. Alternate translation: “this scripture” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:17	a5kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	This is a quotation from Psalm 118, and it is a metaphor. It refers to the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means figuratively that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:17	bd2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες	1	The psalm refers implicitly to the way people in this culture used stones to build the walls of houses and other buildings. Alternate translation: “The stone that the builders thought was not good enough to use for building” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:17	bh2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
20:18	d7n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πᾶς ὁ πεσὼν ἐπ’ ἐκεῖνον τὸν λίθον, συνθλασθήσεται	1	Jesus is applying the metaphor from the psalm to himself. He is speaking figuratively of people who reject him as Messiah as if they would fall over a stone and be injured. Jesus’ words are a direct allusion to the figurative language of Scripture, and he does not explain the metaphor to the people who are listening. So it would not be appropriate to change them into a non-figurative explanation of the metaphor, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:18	n3n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνθλασθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “will break up into pieces” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:18	fdu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐφ’ ὃν δ’ ἂν πέσῃ, λικμήσει αὐτόν	1	Jesus is making a further application of the metaphor from the psalm to himself. He is speaking figuratively of the Messiah judging those who reject him as if he were a large stone that would crush them. Once again it would not be appropriate to change Jesus’ words, which allude directly to the figurative language of Scripture, into a non-figurative explanation of the metaphor. However, you could explain the meaning of the metaphor in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:19	vbf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐζήτησαν & ἐπιβαλεῖν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν τὰς χεῖρας	1	The expression **to lay hands on** means figuratively to arrest a person by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of the person with their **hands**.

20:19	u4tz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	Here Luke uses the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “right at that time” or “immediately” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
20:19	m372		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν λαόν	1	Luke uses the word **and** to introduce a contrast between what the Jewish leaders wanted to do and this reason why they were not able to do. Alternate translation: “but they were afraid of what the people might do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
20:19	u4ta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν λαόν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly that the religious leaders did not arrest Jesus, even though they wanted to, and why they did not. Alternate translation: “but they knew that the people respected Jesus and they were afraid of what the people might do if they did arrest him, so they did not arrest him right then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:19	m373		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔγνωσαν γὰρ ὅτι πρὸς αὐτοὺς εἶπεν τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this the first clause in the verse, since it gives the reason why the religious leaders wanted to arrest Jesus. That is what UST does, making the clause a separate sentence. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
20:20	m374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. The religious leaders could not arrest Jesus openly, so this is what they did instead. Alternate translation: “So” or “Instead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
20:20	f1en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀπέστειλαν ἐνκαθέτους	1	Luke uses this statement to introduce these **spies** as new characters into the story.

20:20	m376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	αὐτοῦ λόγου	1	Luke uses the term **word** figuratively to mean something Jesus might say by using words. Alternate translation: “of something he might say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:20	r84a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὥστε παραδοῦναι αὐτὸν τῇ ἀρχῇ καὶ τῇ ἐξουσίᾳ τοῦ ἡγεμόνος	1	The terms **rule** and **authority** mean basically the same thing. Luke is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms into a single, equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “so that the governor would take Jesus into custody” or “so that the governor would arrest Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
20:21	xn1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτὸν	1	It may be helpful to state explicitly that this happened after the spies whom the leaders sent arrived where Jesus was. Alternate translation: “the spies came and asked Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:21	i3fr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐπηρώτησαν αὐτὸν	1	Luke could mean that one spy spoke on behalf of the whole group. So instead of **they**, you could state “one of them,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
20:21	m377			Διδάσκαλε	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
20:21	v93z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν	1	The spies are speaking only of themselves, so **we** would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
20:21	fi1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐ λαμβάνεις πρόσωπον	1	The spies are using the term **face** figuratively to mean “person.” Alternate translation: “it does not matter to you who a person is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:21	ubu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν ὁδὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The spies speak figuratively of how God wants people to live as if it were a **way** or path that people should follow. Alternate translation: “how God wants people to live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:22	j6wb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔξεστιν	1	The spies are asking about God’s law, not the law of the Roman government.

20:24	j21y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δηνάριον	1	See how you translated this term in [7:41](../07/41.md). Alternate translation: “a Roman coin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
20:24	cvs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνος ἔχει εἰκόνα καὶ ἐπιγραφήν?	1	This is not a rhetorical question, since Jesus does want the spies to answer, even though he already knows the answer to the question himself and he is using it as a teaching tool. So it would not be appropriate to translate this as if it were a statement or an exclamation, for example, “Surely you could see whose picture and name are on this coin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
20:24	wt51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπιγραφήν	1	Jesus is referring figuratively to the name on the coin by association with the fact that it is an **inscription**, that is, something written on the coin. Alternate translation: “name” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:25	rey9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀπόδοτε τὰ Καίσαρος Καίσαρι, καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Jesus is referring figuratively to the Roman government by the name of **Caesar**, its ruler. Alternate translation: “pay the Roman government what it deserves, and pay God what he deserves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:25	gj71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ τῷ Θεῷ	1	Jesus is speaking compactly and he does not repeat the verb **give back**, but it may be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: “and pay God what he deserves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
20:26	wa3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἴσχυσαν ἐπιλαβέσθαι τοῦ ῥήματος	1	Luke says figuratively that the spies had wanted to **take hold** of something Jesus said, as if they could physically grasp his words. Alternate translation: “the spies were not able to use what he said against him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:26	m379		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐναντίον τοῦ λαοῦ	1	Luke speaks of this spatially to refer figuratively to the people’s attention. Alternate translation: “while the people were watching” or “while the people were listening” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:27	m380		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	προσελθόντες δέ τινες τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	Luke uses this statement to introduce these new characters into the story. It may be helpful to introduce them more fully in your translation.

20:27	m381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσελθόντες δέ τινες τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	The implication is that these people also wanted to discredit Jesus.

20:27	m382		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	**Sadducees** is the name of a group of Jews. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
20:27	f9e3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	οἱ, λέγοντες ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	This phrase is identifying the Sadducees as a group of Jews that said no one would rise from the dead. It is not identifying the Sadducees who came to question Jesus as members of that group who held that belief, as if other members did not. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could begin a new sentence here to clarify this. Alternate translation: “The Sadducees believe that no one will rise from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
20:28	m383		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	λέγοντες	1	Luke could mean that one Sadducee spoke on behalf of the whole group, and you could indicate that as UST does. If you decide to do that, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “One of them said to Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
20:28	m384			Διδάσκαλε	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You can translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.

Alternate translation: “Moses instructed us in the law” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:28	m386		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	Here, the word **us** would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. The Sadducces mean “us Jews,” and they are speaking to Jesus, who is also a Jew. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
20:28	d6yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐάν τινος ἀδελφὸς ἀποθάνῃ ἔχων γυναῖκα, καὶ οὗτος ἄτεκνος ᾖ, ἵνα	1	Alternate translation: “if a man’s brother dies who is married but who does not have children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

20:28	m388		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σπέρμα	1	See how you translated this figurative sense of the word **seed** in [1:55](../01/55.md). Alternate translation: “descendants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:29	c2jr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	οὖν	1	The Sadducees are not saying this to draw a logical inference, but to lead into a question about a hypothetical possibility.

20:29	ax5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἑπτὰ οὖν ἀδελφοὶ ἦσαν; καὶ ὁ πρῶτος, λαβὼν γυναῖκα, ἀπέθανεν ἄτεκνος	1	While the Sadducees describe this as if it happened, they are actually asking about a hypothetical possibility in order to test Jesus. Alternate translation: “Suppose there were seven brothers, and the oldest brother got married, but he died before he had any children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
20:29	si57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ πρῶτος	1	Jesus is using the adjective **first** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could specify the person. Alternate translation: “the first brother” or “the oldest brother” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
20:29	m389		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὁ πρῶτος	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “brother number one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
20:30	m390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	καὶ	1	The Sadducees are continuing to describe a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “And suppose that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
20:30	p5mw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ὁ δεύτερος	1	The division at the end of this verse separates this subject from its verb, effectively creating an ellipsis that is not in the original Greek. The verb, “took her,” must now be supplied from the next verse. Alternate translation: “the second brother then married her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
20:30	m391		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὁ δεύτερος	1	The implication, as the next verse says specifically, is that after this second brother married the first brother’s widow, he too died before they had any children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the second brother then married her, but he also died before they had any children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:30	m392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ δεύτερος	1	Jesus is using the adjective **second** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person.

20:31	m393		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	καὶ	1	The Sadducees are continuing to describe a hypothetical situation. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “And suppose that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
20:31	d5tq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ τρίτος ἔλαβεν αὐτήν	1	The implication, as the end of the verse says specifically, is that after this third brother married the widow, he too died before they had any children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The third brother then married her, but he also died before they had any children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:31	m394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ τρίτος	1	Jesus is using the adjective **third** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply the information they leave out from the context. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “In the same way, the rest of the seven brothers married this widow, but they all died before they had any children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:33	avu1			ἐν τῇ & ἀναστάσει	1	The Sadducees did not actually believe that there would be a resurrection. Your language may have a way of showing this. Alternate translation: “in the supposed resurrection” or “when people supposedly rise from the dead”
20:33	m395		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	οὖν	1	This introduces the question that the Sadducees had planned all along to ask Jesus about the hypothetical situation they were describing. If you said “Suppose” in the previous three verses, you could begin this sentence with “Then.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
20:33	m396			οἱ & ἑπτὰ ἔσχον αὐτὴν γυναῖκα	1	Alternate translation: “each of the seven were married to her”
20:34	nlu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου γαμοῦσιν καὶ γαμίσκονται	1	In this culture, the idiom was to say that men married their wives and that women were given in marriage to their husbands by their parents. If your culture does not use different expressions like that, you could use a single term here. Alternate translation: “The people of this present world get married” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
20:34	m397		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου γαμοῦσιν καὶ γαμίσκονται	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, but your culture does use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you can use two different active verbal forms here, and you can state who does the action in the second case. Alternate translation: “In this present world, men marry wives and parents give their daughters in marriage to husbands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:34	n91c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	The term **sons of** is an idiom that means the people in view share the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of living in the present world. Alternate translation: “The people of this present world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
20:34	m398		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ υἱοὶ	1	Jesus is using the word **sons** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “The people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
20:34	m399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου	1	As in [16:8](../16/08.md), here the term **age** means specifically the long period of time defined by the duration of the world; by association, it means the world itself. Alternate translation: “this present world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:35	m8m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ & καταξιωθέντες & οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	As in [20:34](../20/34.md), if your language does not use passive verbal forms, but your culture does use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you can use two different active verbal forms here, and you can specify the agent in the second case.

20:35	m400		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ & καταξιωθέντες	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who does the action. Alternate translation: “the people whom God considers worthy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:35	m401		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἰῶνος ἐκείνου, τυχεῖν καὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως τῆς ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the word **age** in the same figurative sense as in [18:30](../18/30.md), to mean the new world that God will introduce after the end of this present world. See how you translated the expression there. Alternate translation: “to live in his new world when he brings back to life the people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:35	ct9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τυχεῖν & τῆς ἀναστάσεως τῆς ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **resurrection** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “when he brings back to life the people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
20:35	m3gm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

20:35	rh62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	If your culture does not use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you may have you translated this with a single term in [20:34](../20/34.md). If so, you could do the same thing here. Alternate translation: “will not get married” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
20:36	lk28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδὲ & ἀποθανεῖν ἔτι δύνανται	1	The implication is that these people will not need to get married and have children anymore in order to carry on the human race, because they will not die.

20:36	m402		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἰσάγγελοι γάρ εἰσιν	1	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that angels do not die.

20:36	m403		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	υἱοί εἰσιν Θεοῦ	1	Here Jesus is using the term **sons** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “they are God’s own children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
20:36	btb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῆς ἀναστάσεως υἱοὶ ὄντες	1	Jesus is using the term **sons** in this second case idiomatically to mean people who share the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of God bringing them back to life after they have died. Alternate translation: “since God has brought them back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
20:37	j8z5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐγείρονται οἱ νεκροὶ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who does the action. Alternate translation: “God brings back to life people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
20:37	m404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ νεκροὶ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
20:37	g3xg			καὶ Μωϋσῆς	1	Jesus is using the word **even** for emphasis. He is stressing the authority of Moses as someone to whom God gave an extensive revelation of his character and actions. Alternate translation: “Moses himself”
20:37	m405		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μωϋσῆς	1	**Moses** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
20:37	n82t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τῆς βάτου	1	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that he means the bush in the desert that was burning without being consumed, at which Moses encountered God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the burning bush” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:37	m406		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῆς βάτου	1	Jesus is not referring to the actual encounter that Moses had with God at the burning bush, since during that encounter Moses did not say the words that Jesus attributes to him here. Rather, God said those words about himself, and Moses recorded them in the Scriptures. So Jesus is referring by association to the passage in which Moses describes his encounter with God at the burning bush. Alternate translation: “in the passage where he wrote about the burning bush” or “in the scripture about the burning bush” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:37	nx7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	λέγει	1	In many languages, it is conventional to use the present tense to describe what a writer does within a composition. However, if that would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense here. Alternate translation: “he called” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
20:37	pqm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Θεὸν Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ Θεὸν Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ Θεὸν Ἰακώβ	1	The implication is that God would not have identified himself as the God of these men if they were not alive. This must mean that God brought them back to life after they died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:37	m407		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ & Ἰσαὰκ & Ἰακώβ	1	translate-names
20:38	tdq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Jesus uses this word to introduce a teaching about God that will help the Sadducees understand how God’s description of himself at the burning bush proves that God raises people from the dead. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
20:38	u1y5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οὐκ & νεκρῶν, ἀλλὰ ζώντων	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. Jesus is using repetition for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can express this idea with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “of living people only” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
20:38	m408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
20:38	dxi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ζώντων	1	Jesus is using the adjective **living** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “people who are alive” or “people whom he has brought back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
20:38	i6am		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες γὰρ αὐτῷ ζῶσιν	1	Interpreters understand this statement in various ways. One likely possibility is that Jesus is saying implicitly that after people die, while they are **dead** as far as other people are concerned, they are **alive** as far as God is concerned. That is because their spirits live on after death, and God is still able to relate to their spirits. Alternate translation: “because even after people die, God is still able to relate to them as living spirits” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:39	n5nq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀποκριθέντες δέ τινες τῶν γραμματέων εἶπαν	1	Luke uses this statement to reintroduce these characters into the story. Alternate translation: “There were some scribes listening to what Jesus was saying, and they responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
20:39	m409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθέντες & εἶπαν	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that these scribes responded to the teaching that Jesus gave in answer to the question that the Sadducees asked. Alternate translation: “responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
20:39	m410			Διδάσκαλε	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
20:40	m411		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκέτι & ἐτόλμων ἐπερωτᾶν αὐτὸν οὐδέν	1	Here Luke uses a double negative in Greek for emphasis, saying **no longer** and “nothing.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning, “they still dared to ask him something.” If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
20:40	vjx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκέτι & ἐτόλμων ἐπερωτᾶν αὐτὸν οὐδέν	1	The implication in context is that Jesus’ enemies were afraid that if they continued to ask him difficult questions, his wise answers would continue to show how much more he understood than they did. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they were afraid to ask him any more difficult questions, because they realized he would give more wise answers that would show how much more he understood than they did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:40	i6sv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐκέτι & ἐτόλμων	1	It is unclear whether **they** refers to the scribes, the Sadducees, or everyone who had been trying to trap Jesus with difficult questions. It may be best to translate this with a general statement. Alternate translation: “Jesus’ enemies no longer dared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
20:41	t981		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἶπεν & πρὸς αὐτούς	1	As in [20:40](../20/40.md), it is unclear to whom the pronoun **them** refers. It may be best to translate it with a general statement here as well. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to those who were listening” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
20:41	mda6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς λέγουσιν τὸν Χριστὸν εἶναι Δαυεὶδ Υἱόν?	1	This does not seem to be a rhetorical question that Jesus is using as a teaching tool. Rather, it seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer. They had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
20:41	sq2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λέγουσιν	1	Here Jesus is using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense. He does not have specific individuals in mind. Alternate translation: “do people say that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
20:41	b7rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Δαυεὶδ Υἱόν	1	Here Jesus is using the term **son** figuratively to mean “descendant.” Alternate translation: “a descendant of King David” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:41	m412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Δαυεὶδ	1	**David** is the name of a man, Israel’s most important king. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
20:42	y972		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς γὰρ Δαυεὶδ	1	Jesus uses the word **himself** here to emphasize to that it was **David**, the very person whom the scribes call the father of the Christ, who spoke the words in the quotation that follows. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom you call the father of the Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
20:42	z0vc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Jesus uses the word **For** to introduce the reason why he has asked this question. Alternate translation: “I ask this question because” See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
20:42	m413			λέγει	1	In many languages, it is conventional to use the present tense to describe what a writer does within a composition. However, if that would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense here. Alternate translation: “said”
20:42	h2al		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγει ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν, εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation, and then another quotation within that one. Alternate translation: “says in the book of Psalms that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right side” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:42	e1i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance is representing the name Yahweh, which David actually uses in this psalm. In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying that name and said **Lord** instead. The second instance is the regular term for “lord” or “master.” ULT and UST capitalize the word because it refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “The Lord God said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
20:42	m415		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	In this quotation, Yahweh is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate his right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state that specifically. Alternate translation: “Sit at my right side” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
20:42	pse3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	The seat at the right side of a ruler was a position of great honor and authority. By telling the Messiah to sit there, God was symbolically conferring honor and authority on him. Alternate translation: “Sit in the place of honor beside me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
20:43	m416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	This is the continuation of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. If you decided in [20:42](../20/42.md) to have only one level of quotation, you could make the same adjustment here. Alternate translation: “until he made his enemies a footstool for his feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:43	fl1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	The psalm speaks figuratively of the Messiah using his enemies as a **footstool** to mean that Yahweh would make those enemies stop resisting the Messiah and submit to him. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:43	m418		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	If your readers would not know what a **footstool** is, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “something on which you could rest your feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:44	m419		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Δαυεὶδ οὖν, Κύριον, αὐτὸν καλεῖ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David therefore calls the Messiah his Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
20:44	zk2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Δαυεὶδ οὖν, Κύριον, αὐτὸν καλεῖ	1	In this culture, an ancestor was more respected than a descendant. But to call someone **Lord** was to address that person as the more respected one. As the General Notes to this chapter describe, this is a paradox, that is, is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus is calling attention to this paradox to get his listeners to think more deeply about who the Messiah is. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what makes this a paradox. Alternate translation: “David therefore addresses the Messiah respectfully as his Lord. But if the Messiah is his descendant, David should be the more respected person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:44	k1tp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	καὶ πῶς υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	Like the question in [20:41](../20/41.md), this seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones they asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “So why do people say that the Messiah is David’s descendant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
20:44	m427		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Jesus is using this word to show that a conclusion should be drawn as a result of what he has just said, and that this conclusion would be different from what his listeners had previously believed. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
20:44	m426		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱός	1	Here Jesus is using the term **son** figuratively to mean “descendant.” Alternate translation: “descendant” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:45	k3pf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to indicate that after asking his own difficult question to the people who had been trying to trap him, Jesus turned to speak to his disciples. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
20:45	m420		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ	1	Luke is generalizing to refer to everyone who was present as Jesus was teaching. Alternate translation: “all the people who were there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
20:46	m421		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	προσέχετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων	1	Jesus says **beware** to warn about the influence of these people. He is not saying that the scribes themselves are physically dangerous, but that it would be dangerous spiritually to follow their example. Alternate translation: “Be careful not to follow the example of the scribes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:46	ang2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	θελόντων περιπατεῖν ἐν στολαῖς	1	In this culture, **long robes** were a symbol of wealth and status. To walk around in public in a long robe was to assert wealth and status. Alternate translation: “who like to walk around looking important in their long robes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
20:46	m422		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φιλούντων ἀσπασμοὺς	1	The implication is that these would be respectful greetings, in which the scribes would be addressed by important titles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “love to be greeted respectfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:46	m423		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρωτοκαθεδρίας & πρωτοκλισίας	1	As in [14:7](../14/07.md), **first** here figuratively means “best.” Alternate translation: “the best seats … the best places” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:47	m424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἳ κατεσθίουσιν τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus speaks figuratively of the **houses** of widows to mean their wealth and possessions, which they would have in their houses. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:47	c7yv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἳ κατεσθίουσιν τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	Jesus says figuratively that the scribes **devour** or eat up the possessions of widows to mean that they continually ask the widows for money until the widows have none left. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
20:47	g67x			προφάσει μακρὰ προσεύχονται	1	Here, **pretext** refers to something that someone would do in order to appear a certain way. Alternate translation: “in order to seem godly, they offer long prayers”
20:47	zpp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	Jesus is using the word **condemnation** figuratively to mean the punishment that a person would receive after being condemned (found guilty) for doing something wrong. Alternate translation: “These scribes will receive greater punishment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
20:47	zpx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	The implication seems to be that these proud and greedy scribes will receive **greater** punishment than they would have if they had not pretended to be so godly. It is also implicit that God will be the one who punishes them. Alternate translation: “God will punish these scribes more severely because they do all these wrong things while pretending to be godly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:intro	ny7d				0	# Luke 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches about a widow who gave her little money to God (21:1-4)\n2. Jesus tells his disciples what will happen before he returns (21:5-38)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “the times of the nations”\n\nThe Jews spoke of the time between when the Babylonians forced their ancestors to go to Babylon and the time when the Messiah would come as “the times of the nations.” In this expression, the term “nations” means people groups who are not Jews, that is, the Gentiles. So this expression meant the time when the Gentiles ruled over the Jews.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. There is a paradox in this chapter. Jesus tells his disciples in [21:16](../21/16.md), “they will put to death some of you,” but then, in [21:18](../21/18.md), he tells them, “not even a hair of your head will perish.” As a note to [21:18](../21/18.md) explains, Jesus means this second statement in a spiritual sense.
21:1	k2zb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
21:1	m425		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	εἶδεν τοὺς βάλλοντας εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον τὰ δῶρα αὐτῶν πλουσίους	1	This background information that Luke provides introduces a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “he noticed that there were some rich people who were placing gifts of money in the offering boxes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
21:1	m428		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς & πλουσίους	1	Jesus is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “rich people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
21:1	nf4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ δῶρα	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what the **gifts** were. Alternate translation: “gifts of money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:1	unv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	Luke is figuratively describing the boxes in the temple courtyard where people put money that they were giving to God by association with the name of the place where this money would be kept until it was needed, the **treasury**. Alternate translation: “the offering boxes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
21:2	xrk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	εἶδεν δέ τινα χήραν πενιχρὰν	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “There was also a poor widow there, and Jesus saw her” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
21:2	vzu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	λεπτὰ δύο	1	The word **lepta** is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
21:3	i8gf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶπεν	1	Jesus is still speaking to his disciples, as in [20:45](../20/45.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he said to his disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:3	t97j			ἀληθῶς λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
21:3	rwt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ, πλεῖον πάντων ἔβαλεν	1	Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put more money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not interpret them as if they were figurative. For example, it would be a figurative interpretation to say, “God considers what this poor widow has given to be more valuable than the gifts of all the others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
21:3	m429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντων	1	In context, **all** means specifically all of the rich people who were putting large monetary gifts in the collection boxes. Alternate translation: “all of those rich people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:4	x3qb			ἐκ τοῦ περισσεύοντος αὐτοῖς ἔβαλον εἰς τὰ δῶρα	1	Alternate translation: “had a lot of money but only gave a small portion of it”
21:4	gaj8			αὕτη δὲ ἐκ τοῦ ὑστερήματος αὐτῆς, πάντα τὸν βίον ὃν εἶχεν ἔβαλεν	1	Alternate translation: “But she only had a very little money but gave everything she had to live on”
21:5	vgp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τινων	1	The implication is that these were some of Jesus’ disciples. Alternate translation: “some of Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:5	m430		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κεκόσμηται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “people had decorated it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:5	vk7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀναθέμασιν	1	In this context, **offerings** refers specifically to golden ornaments that people had given to beautify the temple and its courtyards. The ornaments were known by this name since people had given them as offerings. Alternate translation: “ornaments that people had donated” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
21:6	lcz6			ταῦτα ἃ θεωρεῖτε	1	Alternate translation: “As for this beautiful temple and its decorations”
21:6	wcd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐλεύσονται ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς	1	Here Jesus is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “there will be a time when” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
21:6	jfl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ λίθῳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “your enemies will not leave one stone upon another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:6	ajx2			οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ λίθῳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this statement in positive form. Alternate translation: “your enemies will topple every stone off the stone it is resting on”
21:6	dps1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ λίθῳ	1	See how you translated the similar expression “they will not leave stone upon stone” in [19:44](../19/44.md). Here as well this is a figurative overstatement to emphasize how completely the enemies of the Jews will destroy the temple. Alternate translation: “your enemies will completely destroy this building of stone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
21:6	m431			ὃς οὐ καταλυθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this statement in positive form and make it a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Every stone will be torn down”
21:6	m432		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς οὐ καταλυθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this as a separate sentence with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. (In the alternate translation that is suggested here, “they” would mean “your enemies,” and “it” would mean “this building of stone,” as in the alternate translation in the last note to the previous phrase in this verse.) Alternate translation: “They will tear it all down” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
21:7	rix4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπηρώτησαν & αὐτὸν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Jesus’ disciples, and the word **him** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the disciples asked Jesus” or “Jesus’ disciples asked him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
21:7	m433			Διδάσκαλε	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.
21:7	a11j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πότε οὖν ταῦτα ἔσται, καὶ τί τὸ σημεῖον ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα γίνεσθαι	1	The phrase **these things** refers implicitly to what Jesus has just said about enemies destroying the temple. Alternate translation: “then when will the temple be destroyed, and how will we know that our enemies are about to destroy it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
21:8	bbri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	βλέπετε μὴ πλανηθῆτε; πολλοὶ γὰρ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ἐγώ εἰμι, καί, ὁ καιρὸς ἤγγικεν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation.

21:8	sls1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ πορευθῆτε ὀπίσω αὐτῶν	1	Here the expression **go after** seems to have a figurative sense like that of the term **follow**, found in [5:27](../05/27.md) and several other places in the book, meaning to become someone’s disciple.

Alternate translation: “great signs from God” or “great signs that God sends” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

21:14	q1s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	οὖν	1	**But** is usually translated “therefore” because it typically introduces a result or conclusion from something that has just been said. However, in some cases, including this one, the term instead indicates a contrast with what has just been said. Knowing they would be put on trial, Jesus’ disciples would naturally want to think about how to defend themselves, but Jesus is telling them, by contrast, not to do that.

Jesus may be saying that there will be larger and more frequent hurricanes at this time. However, they could also be figurative.

You could represent this possible metaphor as a simile in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They will be as anxious as they would be in a great storm at sea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

21:26	m473		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	αἱ γὰρ δυνάμεις τῶν οὐρανῶν σαλευθήσονται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this statement first in the verse, since it gives the reason for the results that the rest of the verse describes. You could begin this statement with “Since,” or you could have no introductory word for it and introduce the rest of the verse with “and so.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
21:26	wn9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αἱ & δυνάμεις τῶν οὐρανῶν σαλευθήσονται	1	The phrase **the powers of the heavens** is most likely an idiomatic reference back to the sun, moon, and stars, which Jesus mentioned at the beginning of the previous verse.

21:29	m479		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὴν συκῆν	1	Jesus is speaking of these trees in general, not one particular **fig tree**. Alternate translation: “the fig trees” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

(The traditional verse divisions put the phrase “like a trap” at the start of the next verse. A note will discuss it there.)

21:36	h83d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ σταθῆναι ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here, **stand** is an idiom that means to be declared innocent when judged, as in [Psalm 130:3](../psa/130/03.md), “If you, Yahweh, would mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?” (That is, “If you, Yahweh, kept a record of sins, no one would be declared innocent.”) Jesus is referring to the time when he will judge everyone.

22:intro	y8nr				0	# Luke 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Judas Iscariot agrees to betray Jesus to his enemies (22:1-6)\n2. Jesus shares the Passover meal with his disciples (22:7-38)\n3. Jesus prays on the Mount of Olives and is arrested there (22:39-53)\n4. Peter denies Jesus (22:54-62)\n5. Soldiers mock Jesus and the Jewish leaders question him (22:63-71)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus\n\n[22:14-20](../22/14.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking figuratively and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.\n\n### The new covenant\n\nSome people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “And an angel from heaven appeared to him … his sweat became like drops of blood falling on the ground”\n\nVerses 43 and 44 of Luke 22 are not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible, and so they are likely not an original part of the Gospel of Luke. However, many scholars consider them to provide accurate accounts of real events in Jesus’ life that were preserved in oral or written traditions about him and copied into the book of Luke at an early stage. ULT and UST include these verses, but some other versions do not. If you decide to translate these verses, you should put them inside square brackets to indicate that they are probably not original to Luke’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
22:1	q8fa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to begin relating a new event by introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens.

22:2	aij5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐφοβοῦντο γὰρ τὸν λαόν	1	These leaders were not trying to have Jesus killed because they were afraid of **the people**.

Alternate translation: “quietly, because they were afraid that the people would riot if they did it publicly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
22:4	qpi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	στρατηγοῖς	1	The temple had its own guards, and these were their commanding officers. Alternate translation: “captains of the temple guard” or “temple military officers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

22:5	usn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	αὐτῷ ἀργύριον δοῦναι	1	Luke is speaking figuratively of money by reference to the precious metal, **silver**, that gives it its value. Alternate translation: “to pay Judas money for doing this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

22:8	m504		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	πορευθέντες, ἑτοιμάσατε	1	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, **you** as implied in the participle and imperative verb would be in the dual, if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
22:8	nkz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πορευθέντες	1	The implication is that Jesus is sending Peter and John into the city of Jerusalem to do this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Your language might translate this as an imperative. Alternate translation: “Go into the city of Jerusalem and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:8	e4ev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν & ἵνα φάγωμεν	1	Peter and John would be part of the group that would eat the meal, so the terms **us** and **we** would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
22:8	m505		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ Πάσχα	1	Jesus is using the name of this part of the festival, **Passover**, to refer figuratively to the meal that people shared on that occasion. Alternate translation: “the Passover meal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:9	j52e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	θέλεις ἑτοιμάσωμεν	1	Jesus was not part of the group that would prepare the meal, so the word **we** does not include Jesus and it would be exclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
22:9	s8yw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	ἑτοιμάσωμεν	1	Peter and John are speaking as a group of two, so this verb would be in the dual form if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
22:10	um6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς & ὑμῶν & ὑμῖν & ἀκολουθήσατε	1	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, the pronouns **them** and **you** and the implied **you** in the imperative verb would all be in the dual form, if your language uses that form.

22:10	c13w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus uses this word to tell Peter and John to pay close attention to what he is saying and to do exactly what he tells them. It may be helpful to explain the meaning of the word more fully and to do so as a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Now pay close attention to these instructions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:10	i45e			συναντήσει ὑμῖν ἄνθρωπος, κεράμιον ὕδατος βαστάζων	1	Alternate translation: “you will see a man carrying a pitcher of water”
22:10	a677		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κεράμιον ὕδατος	1	This means not a small serving **pitcher**, but a large earthen jug, which the man would likely be carrying on his shoulder. If your language has its own term for a large container that people use to transport water, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:11	khy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐρεῖτε τῷ οἰκοδεσπότῃ τῆς οἰκίας, λέγει σοι ὁ διδάσκαλος, ποῦ ἐστιν τὸ κατάλυμα, ὅπου τὸ Πάσχα μετὰ τῶν μαθητῶν μου φάγω?	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation and then another quotation within that one. Alternate translation: “tell the owner of the house that the Teacher wants to know where the guest room is where he can eat the Passover meal with his disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:11	iv6f			ὁ διδάσκαλος	1	**Teacher** is a respectful title for Jesus. You could translate it with an equivalent term that your language and culture would use.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:12	m506		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐστρωμένον	1	This is a passive verbal form. If your language does not use such forms, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “that has carpets, dining couches, and a dining table” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:13	m507		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentences described. Because Jesus told Peter and John to do this, they did it. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
22:13	g9ty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπελθόντες	1	The implication is that these two disciples went into the city of Jerusalem, as Jesus had told them to do. Alternate translation: “Peter and John went into the city of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:13	m508		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ Πάσχα	1	Luke is using the name of this part of the festival, **Passover**, to refer figuratively to the meal that people shared on that occasion. Alternate translation: “the Passover meal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

22:14	lnc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνέπεσεν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [5:29](../05/29.md). It was the custom in this culture for dinner guests to eat while lying comfortably around the table on banqueting couches. Alternate translation: “Jesus took his place at the table” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:15	hue3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἐπιθυμίᾳ ἐπεθύμησα	1	Jesus is using a characteristic Hebrew construction, a cognate noun with a verb, to express intensity. If your language has this same construction, you could use it here. But if this construction would seem to express unnecessary extra information in your language, you could show the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I have wanted very much” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
22:15	m509		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦτο τὸ Πάσχα	1	Jesus is using the name of this part of the festival, **Passover**, to refer figuratively to the meal that people shared on that occasion. Alternate translation: “this Passover meal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

22:16	m510		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	γὰρ	1	Jesus is giving the reason why he has been so eager to share this Passover meal with his disciples, as he said in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this reason before the result by creating a verse bridge. You could combine [22:15](../22/15.md) and [22:16](../22/16.md), putting all of [22:16](../22/16.md) first, followed by all of [22:15](../22/15.md). This would require saying “this Passover meal” in [22:16](../22/16.md) and **it** in [22:15](../22/15.md). You could have no introductory word for [22:16](../22/16.md) and begin [22:15](../22/15.md) with “And so.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
22:16	gbj7			λέγω & ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”

22:16	k28r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἕως ὅτου πληρωθῇ ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. This could mean: (1) “until people celebrate this feast in the kingdom of God.” (2) “until God gives this feast its full meaning when he establishes his kingdom.” (3) “until I die as the true Passover sacrifice and establish the kingdom of God.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:17	l5e6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	δεξάμενος ποτήριον	1	Luke is using the term **cup** figuratively to mean what it contained, which was wine. Alternate translation: “Jesus picked up a cup of wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:17	d7pc			εὐχαριστήσας	1	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “when he had given thanks to God”
22:17	xvm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διαμερίσατε εἰς ἑαυτούς	1	Jesus meant that the apostles were to divide up the contents of the cup, not the cup itself. Alternate translation: “share the wine that is in this cup among yourselves” or “each of you drink some wine from this cup” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:18	m512		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	γὰρ	1	Jesus is giving the reason why he wants his disciples to share the wine, as he told them to do in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
22:18	m78n			λέγω & ὑμῖν	1	Jesus is using this phrase to emphasize the importance of what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
22:18	h5tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου	1	Jesus is referring figuratively to the juice that people squeeze from grapes that grow on grapevines as if it were the **fruit** or grapes themselves. Wine is made from fermented grape juice. Alternate translation: “wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:18	crv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἕως οὗ ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἔλθῃ	1	Jesus is speaking figuratively of the **kingdom of God** as if it could actively come on its own. Alternate translation: “until God establishes his kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
22:18	m513		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἕως οὗ ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ ἔλθῃ	1	See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [4:43](../04/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “until God begins to rule as king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
22:19	m514		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἄρτον	1	The term **bread** refers to a loaf of bread, which is a lump of flour dough that a person has shaped and baked. See how you translated this term in [9:13](../09/13.md). Alternate translation: “a loaf of bread” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:19	nd2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄρτον	1	Since Jews did not eat bread made with yeast during this festival, this bread would not have had any yeast in it and it would have been flat. Alternate translation: “a loaf of unleavened bread” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:19	m515			εὐχαριστήσας	1	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “when he had given thanks to God”
22:19	d3yc			ἔκλασεν	1	Jesus may have divided the loaf of **bread** into many pieces, as UST says, or he may have divided it into two pieces and given those to the apostles to divide among themselves. If possible, use an expression in your language that would apply to either situation.
22:19	m516		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς	1	The implication is that Jesus gave the bread to the disciples to eat. Alternate translation: “and gave it to them to eat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:19	d8r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter about how to translate this phrase. Christians understand this phrase to be: (1) a metaphor. Alternate translation: “This represents my body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) (2) literal. Alternate translation: “My body is really present in this bread”
22:19	lc9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν διδόμενον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “which I am giving for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:19	cxy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτο ποιεῖτε εἰς τὴν ἐμὴν ἀνάμνησιν	1	Jesus seems to be telling his disciples implicitly that he wants them to re-enact this part of the meal regularly in the future in order to remember him. Alternate translation: “When you meet together, break and share bread like this in order to remember me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:20	m517		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὸ ποτήριον	1	Luke is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “And he took the cup” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
22:20	z3cx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ποτήριον & τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον	1	In each case, the term **cup** figuratively means what the **cup** contained, which was wine. Alternate translation: “the cup of wine … The wine in this cup” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:20	gc8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ καινὴ διαθήκη ἐν τῷ αἵματί μου	1	In the Hebrew culture, covenants were customarily ratified through animal sacrifices that involved shedding the blood of the animals. Here, Jesus is likely alluding to that practice in light of his impending sacrificial death. Alternate translation: “the new covenant that will be ratified when I shed my blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:20	v4d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐκχυννόμενον	1	Jesus is referring to the way his blood is going to be **poured out** when he dies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “which I will pour out for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:21	swj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus is using the term **behold** to get his disciples to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:21	g6ks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἡ χεὶρ τοῦ παραδιδόντος με μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης	1	Jesus is figuratively using one part of this person, his **hand**, to represent the entire person. There is significance to the part that Jesus chooses. With the same hand with which Judas has just received the bread and wine, he will receive the money for betraying Jesus. Alternate translation: “the man who is going to betray me is sharing this meal with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
22:21	m518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης	1	Jesus is using the shared location of the **table** figuratively to mean sharing the meal that is being served on the **table**. Alternate translation: “sharing this meal with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:22	wtj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	ὅτι	1	Jesus is giving the reason why one of his disciples is going to betray him, as he said in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
22:22	mk3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς μὲν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου & πορεύεται	1	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I, the Son of Man, indeed go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
22:22	m519		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς μὲν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου & πορεύεται	1	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah, indeed go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

22:24	yyw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	Luke may use this word simply to indicate that the quarrel about which disciple was the greatest took place after the discussion about which disciple would betray Jesus. However, he could also be using the word to indicate that the quarrel arose directly from the discussion. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
22:24	y9ce			δοκεῖ εἶναι μείζων	1	Here Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “appeared to be the greatest one” or “people should consider to be the greatest one”
22:24	m521			μείζων	1	Your language might naturally use the comparative form of the adjective here, **greater**, to express the issue in terms of which one disciple was greater than all the others. Or your language might naturally use the superlative form, “greatest,” to express the issue in terms of which disciple was the greatest of them all. Alternate translation: “the greatest one”
22:25	m522		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ βασιλεῖς τῶν ἐθνῶν	1	Here Jesus assumes that his disciples will know that by **the nations** he means the people groups who are not Jews. Alternate translation: “the kings of the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

22:25	tw4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	εὐεργέται, καλοῦνται	1	The subjects of these rulers did not call them this spontaneously and gratefully. Rather, the rulers gave themselves this title, even though they were not really ruling in a way that was good for their subjects, as Jesus says in the first part of this sentence. Jesus is mentioning the title to emphasize how undeserved it is. Alternate translation: “nevertheless give themselves the title of Benefactor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
22:25	m523		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καλοῦνται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “call themselves” or “give themselves the title” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:25	m524		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	εὐεργέται	1	This is a title that several rulers of this time had given themselves. Your language may have an equivalent title. If not, you could express the meaning with an equivalent expression, as UST does. Alternate translation: “the Good” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
22:26	ne9r			ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐχ οὕτως	1	Alternate translation: “But you should not act like that”
22:26	m525			ὁ μείζων ἐν ὑμῖν, γενέσθω ὡς ὁ νεώτερος	1	As the last note to [22:24](../22/24.md) discusses, your language might naturally use the superlative form of these adjectives rather than the comparative form. Alternate translation: “let the greatest one among you become like the youngest one”
22:26	m526		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ μείζων & ὁ νεώτερος	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **greater** and **younger** as nouns to describe types of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “the greatest one … the youngest one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
22:26	cdq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ νεώτερος	1	This culture respected older people and followed them as leaders. Jesus is referring figuratively to a person who was less important and influential by association with the fact that this would be the case if they were younger. Alternate translation: “the least important one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:26	y4n1			ὁ διακονῶν	1	Alternate translation: “a servant”
22:27	mw2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Jesus uses this word to introduce a reason why his disciples should do what he told them in the previous verse. The reason is that he is already setting a personal example of this himself. Alternate translation: “After all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
22:27	jt7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς & μείζων, ὁ ἀνακείμενος ἢ ὁ διακονῶν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I want you to think about who is greater, the person who is dining, or the who is serving the food.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:27	n3dl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ ἀνακείμενος	1	See how you translated this phrase in [5:29](../05/29.md).

Alternate translation: “the person who is dining” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:27	lu3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ὁ ἀνακείμενος?	1	Jesus is using a further question to teach his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “You must agree that it is the person who is dining.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:27	qbn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγὼ δὲ ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν εἰμι ὡς ὁ διακονῶν	1	Jesus is likely referring to the example that he has set at this meal. This would include serving the bread to the disciples, which Luke describes in [22:19](../22/19.md). [John 13:4-5](../jhn/13/04.md) also records that before this meal, Jesus washed the disciples feet, which a household servant would ordinarily have done. Alternate translation: “But I have been acting like a servant here at this meal with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:28	i9xb			οἱ διαμεμενηκότες μετ’ ἐμοῦ, ἐν τοῖς πειρασμοῖς μου	1	Alternate translation: “the ones who have stayed with me through my struggles”
22:29	w4pd			κἀγὼ διατίθεμαι ὑμῖν, καθὼς διέθετό μοι ὁ Πατήρ μου βασιλείαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “And so, just as my Father has given a kingdom to me, I am giving one to you”
22:29	nly5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κἀγὼ διατίθεμαι ὑμῖν, καθὼς διέθετό μοι ὁ Πατήρ μου βασιλείαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “And so I am giving you the authority to rule, just as my Father has done for me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
22:29	m527		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	κἀγὼ	1	Jesus uses this expression to indicate that what he is about to say is the result of what he has just said. Alternate translation: “And so I” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
22:29	ii65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατήρ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
22:30	m528		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἵνα ἔσθητε καὶ πίνητε ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζης μου	1	Jesus may simply be referring to the way he and his disciples will renew their table fellowship in the kingdom of God, as he described in [22:16](../22/16.md). But he may also be referring figuratively to his disciples becoming important officials in his kingdom, since such officials would have their meals at the king’s **table**. Alternate translation: “so that you may be important officials” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:30	m529		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ μου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **kingdom** with a verb such as “rule” and a concrete noun such as “king.” Alternate translation: “when I rule as king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
22:30	us1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	καθῆσθε ἐπὶ θρόνων	1	Rulers have **thrones** that symbolize their authority. These special seats are signs of status and power. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in some way in your translation. Alternate translation: “sit on royal thrones” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
22:30	m530		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰς δώδεκα φυλὰς & τοῦ Ἰσραήλ	1	Here Jesus uses the term **tribes** figuratively to refer to the people who belong to those **tribes**. Alternate translation: “the people of the 12 tribes of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:31	t8qd			Σίμων, Σίμων	1	Jesus says the name of this disciple twice to show him that what he is about to say to him is very important. Your language may have a way of addressing someone to show this same thing. Alternate translation: “Now Simon”
22:31	m531		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σίμων	1	**Simon** is the name of a man. See how you translated his name in [4:38](../04/38.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
22:31	m532		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus uses the term **behold** to get Simon to focus his attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “listen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:31	m533		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ὁ Σατανᾶς	1	**Satan** is the name of the devil. See how you translated this title in [10:18](../10/18.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
22:31	m534			ἐξῃτήσατο	1	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. Alternate translation: “has asked God for permission”
22:31	m535		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον	1	To **sift wheat** means to put it in a sieve, which is a container with a mesh bottom, and shake it back and forth so that the grain stays in the sieve and the husk or chaff falls out. If your readers would not be familiar with **wheat**, you could use the name of a grain that they would recognize, or use a general expression. Alternate translation: “to shake you as if he were separating grain from its husks in a sieve” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:31	qyy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἐξῃτήσατο ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον	1	Jesus is using this comparison to say figuratively that Satan wants to put the disciples through difficult experiences in order to show that many of them are not unconditionally loyal to Jesus. You could use this same comparison in your translation, or you could explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “to shake you as if he were separating grain from its husks in a sieve” or “to test you to show that many of you will not stay loyal to me when threatened” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
22:31	m536		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξῃτήσατο ὑμᾶς τοῦ σινιάσαι ὡς τὸν σῖτον	1	The implication is that God has given Satan permission to do this, and that is why Jesus is giving this warning. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to test you to show that many of you are not unconditionally loyal to me, and God has given him permission to do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:31	dmw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμᾶς	1	Here, **you** is plural. Jesus is referring to all of the apostles. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
22:32	m537			ἐγὼ & ἐδεήθην	1	Your language may require you to state the object of the verb. In this context the verb has a strong sense. Alternate translation: “I have prayed to God” or “I have pleaded with God”
22:32	pd1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ἐγὼ δὲ ἐδεήθην περὶ σοῦ	1	Jesus is addressing Simon specifically, and so the terms **you** and **your** are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
22:32	zp8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ἵνα μὴ ἐκλίπῃ ἡ πίστις σου	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning of the negative word **not** combined with the negative verb **fail** as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “that you will continue to have faith” or “that you will continue to trust me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
22:32	qxk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ποτε ἐπιστρέψας	1	This expression refers figuratively to resuming a previous course of action. Alternate translation: “when you are once more openly loyal to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:32	f9v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	στήρισον τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	The implication is that Jesus wants Simon to **strengthen** the other disciples in their faith. Alternate translation: “encourage the other disciples to be strong in their faith as well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:32	r7ux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	Jesus is using the term **brothers** figuratively to mean someone who shares the same belief. Alternate translation: “your fellow believers” or “the other disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:32	m538		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφούς σου	1	Here Jesus has the other apostles, who are all men, initially in view. But he may also want Simon to strengthen the faith of any of his other disciples, male or female, who need encouragement. In that case, he would be using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “your fellow believers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
22:33	m539		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	**He** refers to Simon, who was also known as Peter, and the word **him** refers to Jesus. Jesus calls him Peter in the next verse. So that your readers will know that Jesus is talking to the same man there, you could use both of his names here. Alternate translation: “But Simon Peter said to Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
22:34	m540		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ εἶπεν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “But Jesus answered” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
22:34	m541			λέγω σοι	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell Peter. Alternate translation: “Indeed”
22:34	tu15			οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ, ἕως τρίς με ἀπαρνήσῃ εἰδέναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me”
22:34	pwj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ, ἕως	1	Jesus is referring figuratively to a certain time of day. Roosters crow just before the sun appears in the morning. In other words, Jesus is referring to dawn. Alternate translation: “before another morning begins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:34	eq7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐ φωνήσει σήμερον ἀλέκτωρ, ἕως	1	A **rooster** is a bird that calls out loudly around the time the sun comes up. If your readers would not be familiar with this bird, you could use the name of a bird in your area that calls out or sings just before dawn, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “before the birds begin to sing in the morning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:34	m542		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ἀλέκτωρ	1	Jesus is not speaking of one particular **rooster** but of roosters in general. Alternate translation: “the roosters” or “the birds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
22:34	m543		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σήμερον	1	The Jewish day began at sunset. Jesus was speaking after the sun had set. The rooster would crow just before morning. That morning was considered part of the same day. Alternate translation: “in the morning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:35	m544		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἄτερ βαλλαντίου, καὶ πήρας, καὶ ὑποδημάτων	1	As in [10:4](../10/04.md), Jesus is speaking of these items figuratively to mean what they represent. See how you translated these terms there. Alternate translation: “without any money or provisions or extra clothes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:35	m545		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μή τινος ὑστερήσατε?	1	The first word of this question in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding, **did you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Alternate translation: “did you lack anything?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
22:35	cv68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μή τινος ὑστερήσατε?	1	Even though Jesus already knows the answer to this question and he is using it as a teaching tool, in this case he does want the disciples to reply. If you translated his words as a statement, for example, “I know that you did not lack anything,” then the disciples might seem to be interrupting him by speaking uninvited. Since Jesus did want them to speak, it would probably be most appropriate to present his words in the form of a question. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:35	tb51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐθενός	1	Luke may be summarizing the disciples’ response briefly, or the disciples themselves may have responded this briefly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could expand on what this means. Alternate translation: “We did not lack anything” or “We had everything we needed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
22:36	h7j7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ὁ ἔχων βαλλάντιον & ὁ μὴ ἔχων & μάχαιραν	1	Jesus was not referring to a specific one of the disciples who had a money bag or did not have a sword. Alternate translation: “anyone who has a money bag … anyone who does not have a sword” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
22:36	m546		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἔχων βαλλάντιον & ὁ μὴ ἔχων & μάχαιραν	1	Jesus is giving these instructions specifically to his disciples. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “any one of you who has a money bag … any one of you who does not have a sword” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:36	q717		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ ἱμάτιον	1	See how you translated **cloak** in [19:35](../19/35.md). Alternate translation: “coat” or “outer garment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:37	n73l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	γὰρ	1	Jesus is giving the reason why the disciples should now be concerned about providing for and protecting themselves, as he said in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
22:37	m547			λέγω & ὑμῖν	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell the disciples. Alternate translation: “indeed”
22:37	g4l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τοῦτο τὸ γεγραμμένον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “what a prophet wrote in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:37	m548		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτο τὸ γεγραμμένον	1	Jesus may be assuming that his disciples know the source and subject of this passage. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could identify it more specifically. Alternate translation: “what Isaiah wrote about the Messiah in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:37	u9jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δεῖ τελεσθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. The meaning of **accomplished** is the same as for the word “fulfilled” in [1:1](../01/01.md), [1:20](../01/20.md), and many other places in the book, even though the Greek verb is different. Alternate translation: “must happen to me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:37	m549		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	τό καὶ μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be more natural in your language to use a singular form here. Alternate translation: “that people would consider me to be a criminal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
22:37	jz9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη	1	Jesus is using the adjective **lawless** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “he was considered a criminal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
22:37	jf1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “people considered him to be a criminal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:37	se1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ γὰρ τὸ περὶ ἐμοῦ τέλος ἔχει	1	Here Jesus is speaking implicitly about what the Scriptures say about him. Alternate translation: “Yes, what the Scriptures say about me must certainly happen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:38	kbt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἱκανόν ἐστιν	1	This could mean: (1) Jesus is indicating that when he told his disciples to buy swords, he meant for their own defense, not to attack their enemies, and that they have enough swords for that purpose. Alternate translation: “That will be enough for us to defend ourselves” (2) Jesus wants them to stop talking about having swords. The implication would be that when he said they should buy swords, he was mainly warning them that they were going to face dangers, and he did not really want them to buy swords and fight. Alternate translation: “That is enough talk about swords, I do not really want you to buy them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:39	zaw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ἐξελθὼν, ἐπορεύθη κατὰ τὸ ἔθος εἰς τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν	1	Luke provides this background information about where Jesus went to help readers understand what happens next in the story. Luke has already indicated in [21:37](../21/37.md) that during this time in Jerusalem, Jesus did not spend the nights in the city, but rather in this location. Alternate translation: “leaving the city of Jerusalem, Jesus went to spend the night on the Mount of Olives, as he had been doing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
22:39	m550		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν	1	This is the name of a hill or mountain. See how you translated this place in [19:29](../19/29.md). Alternate translation: “Olive Tree Mountain” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
22:40	m551		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	γενόμενος δὲ ἐπὶ τοῦ τόπου	1	Luke says **he**, meaning Jesus, to refer figuratively to Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “when Jesus and his disciples arrived at the Mount of Olives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
22:40	b6pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	προσεύχεσθε μὴ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς πειρασμόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **temptation** with a verb such as “tempt.” Alternate translation: “Pray that nothing will tempt you to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
22:40	m552		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσεύχεσθε μὴ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς πειρασμόν	1	The implications are that the disciples will soon face the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Pray that when the Jewish leaders come to arrest me and you are tempted to try to save yourselves by running away or denying that you know me, you will not sin by doing that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:41	sp1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὡσεὶ λίθου βολήν	1	This is an idiom that means “about as far as someone can throw a stone.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could represent this with a general expression or with an estimated measurement. Alternate translation: “a short distance” or “about 30 meters” or “about 100 feet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:41	m553		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	θεὶς τὰ γόνατα	1	As Jesus indicates in his parable in [18:11](../18/11.md), the customary posture of prayer in this culture was standing. By kneeling down, Jesus indicated that he was praying urgently about a serious matter. Alternate translation: “after kneeling down to show the urgency of his request” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
22:42	y51l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
22:42	m554		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal	εἰ βούλει & τὸ σὸν	1	Use your best judgment about whether the formal or informal forms of **you** and **yours** would be more natural in your language here. Jesus is speaking as an adult son would to a father with whom he had a close relationship. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
22:42	ic7y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρένεγκε τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Jesus is referring to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a cup of bitter-tasting liquid that he would have to drink. Alternate translation: “please spare me from these sufferings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:42	m555		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρένεγκε τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please spare me from these sufferings” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
22:42	zw2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	πλὴν μὴ τὸ θέλημά μου, ἀλλὰ τὸ σὸν γινέσθω	1	This is another imperative that should be translated as a request rather than as a command. Alternate translation: “However, please do what is according to your will, rather than what is according to my will” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
22:43	m556		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Ὤφθη δὲ αὐτῷ ἄγγελος ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ ἐνισχύων αὐτόν	1	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The note below discusses a translation issue in this verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
22:43	m557		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Ὤφθη & αὐτῷ	1	**Appeared** does not mean that the angel simply seemed to be there, or that Jesus saw the angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Jesus. Alternate translation: “came there to be with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:44	m558		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Καὶ γενόμενος ἐν ἀγωνίᾳ ἐκτενέστερον προσηύχετο. καὶ Ἐγένετο ὁ ἱδρὼς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ θρόμβοι αἵματος καταβαίνοντες ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The two notes below discusses translation issues in this verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
22:44	m559			ἐκτενέστερον προσηύχετο	1	This could mean: (1) Luke is using the comparative form of the adjective **earnest**, which has an adverbial sense here, with a superlative meaning. Alternate translation: “he was praying most earnestly” or “he was praying very fervently” (2) the word has an actual comparative sense. Alternate translation: “he began to pray even more earnestly than he had been praying before”
22:44	m560		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	Ἐγένετο ὁ ἱδρὼς αὐτοῦ ὡσεὶ θρόμβοι αἵματος καταβαίνοντες ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	This could mean one of two things. The first is more likely. (1) It could describe the appearance of the drops. This would mean that Jesus had been under such stress that the small blood vessels that fed his sweat glands ruptured, and his sweat became mixed with blood. (This is a rare but well-document medical condition known as hematohidrosis.) Alternate translation: “his sweat became mixed with blood and it fell to the ground in drops” (2) It could describe the way in which the drops of sweat fell to the ground. Alternate translation: “he began to sweat so intensely that the sweat formed drops and fell to the ground as blood drops do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
22:45	m561		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	Luke uses the word **and** to indicate that what he describes next came after what he described just previously. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
22:45	m562			ἀναστὰς ἀπὸ τῆς προσευχῆς, ἐλθὼν πρὸς τοὺς μαθητὰς	1	Alternate translation: “when Jesus had finished praying, he got up and went back to his disciples”
22:45	gb3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εὗρεν κοιμωμένους αὐτοὺς ἀπὸ τῆς λύπης	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **sorrow** with an adjective such as “sad.” Alternate translation: “saw that they were sleeping because they were tired from being sad” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
22:46	in7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί καθεύδετε?	1	Jesus is not looking for information. He is using the question form to rebuke his disciples. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be sleeping now!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:46	nl7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **temptation** with a verb such as “tempt.” See how you translated the similar phrase in [22:40](../22/40.md). Alternate translation: “so that nothing tempts you to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
22:46	m563		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵνα μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	As in [22:40](../22/40.md), the implications are that the disciples will soon face the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If you indicated that explicitly in your translation there, you could state something similar here. Alternate translation: “so that when the Jewish leaders arrest me and you are tempted to abandon me to save yourselves, you will not sin by doing that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:47	m564		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:47	kt25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ὄχλος	1	Luke is introducing new characters into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “there was a crowd that arrived” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
22:47	m565		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰούδας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the man whose name was Judas” or “the man that people called Judas” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
22:47	m56x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰούδας	1	**Judas** is the name of a man. See how you translated his name in [22:3](../22/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
22:47	m567		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	εἷς τῶν δώδεκα	1	See how you translated this phrase in [8:1](../08/01.md). You may have decided to translate the nominal adjective **Twelve** with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “who was one of the 12 men Jesus had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
22:47	m568		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τῶν δώδεκα	1	You may have decided instead in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate **Twelve** as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
22:47	mva7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προήρχετο αὐτούς	1	Judas was showing the people where Jesus was. He was not the person in charge of the whole group. Alternate translation: “leading them to where Jesus was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:47	c2l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	φιλῆσαι αὐτόν	1	In this culture, when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would kiss them on one cheek or on both cheeks. If your readers would find it embarrassing if you said that one man would kiss another man, you could explain the purpose of the gesture, or you could translate the expression in a more general way. Alternate translation: “to greet him by kissing him on the cheek” or “to give him a friendly greeting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
22:48	e2n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	φιλήματι τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου παραδίδως?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke Judas. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be using a kiss to betray the Son of Man!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:48	zvk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Jesus is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “me, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
22:48	m569		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:49	njs1			οἱ περὶ αὐτὸν	1	The expression **those who were around him** refers to Jesus' disciples. Alternate translation: “Jesus’ disciples, who were around him,”
22:49	y5za		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ ἐσόμενον	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “that the Jewish leaders and soldiers who had come were going to arrest Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:49	m570		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ	1	This was an idiomatic way to ask a question. Alternate translation: “should we strike with the sword” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:49	m571		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ	1	The disciples may be asking specifically not about what weapon to use, but generally whether they should fight back to prevent Jesus from being arrested. In that case they would be using one kind of weapon, a **sword**, to mean fighting in general. The disciples said in [22:38](../22/38.md) that they had two swords, but they could also have resisted by further means. Alternate translation: “should we fight to defend you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
22:49	gv81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ	1	Alternatively, the disciples may implicitly be asking whether this was the kind of occasion for which Jesus told them in [22:38](../22/38.md) that they should have swords. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you told us we should have swords; should we use them now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:50	b4ij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	εἷς τις ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	Luke uses this phrase to bring one of the characters into the story into the center of the action, but he does not identify the person by name. John indicates in his Gospel that it was Peter, but since Luke does not name him here, it would not be appropriate to use his name in your translation. Alternate translation: “one of the disciples who was there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
22:50	f2fm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπάταξεν & τὸν δοῦλον τοῦ ἀρχιερέως	1	The implication is that this disciple did this with a sword. Alternate translation: “struck the servant of the high priest with a sword” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:51	m572		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς & ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what the disciple had just done. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
22:51	rcp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐᾶτε ἕως τούτου	1	This is an idiom. It is in the form of a positive statement, but it actually has a strong negative meaning. Alternate translation: “No more of this” or “Do not do anything more like that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:51	c6pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἁψάμενος τοῦ ὠτίου, ἰάσατο αὐτόν	1	It may be necessary to explain what it means that Jesus touched the servant’s **ear**, since it had been cut off. Alternate translation: “Jesus put the servant’s ear back in place and healed it” or “Jesus touched the servant at the place where his ear had been cut off and restored it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:52	m573		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	στρατηγοὺς τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	See how you translated this phrase in [22:4](../22/04.md). Alternate translation: “captains of the temple guard” or “temple military officers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:52	fa7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the Jewish leaders. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You did not need to bring soldiers with weapons to arrest me, as if I were a bandit!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:52	m574		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων?	1	The implication, as Jesus will say specifically in the next verse, is that he has demonstrated that he is a peaceful person. He has taught openly and undefened in the temple. He has not gathered an armed band around him and operated from a hidden location. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You have seen that I am a peaceful person, yet you come to arrest me bringing soldiers with weapons, as if I were a bandit!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:52	m575		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this simile. Here, the term **robber** likely indicates a violent person who steals from others by forcing them to hand over their valuables, threatening to harm them if they refuse. Alternate translation: “as if I were a bandit who needed to be subdued with force” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
22:52	m576		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων	1	Jesus is speaking of these weapons figuratively, to mean the soldiers who are carrying them. Alternate translation: “soldiers armed with weapons” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:53	a6qu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	Only priests were allowed to enter the **temple** building, so Jesus means the temple courtyard. He is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
22:53	c4is		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐξετείνατε τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ ἐμέ	1	As in [20:19](../20/19.md), here this expression means figuratively to arrest a person by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of the person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “you did not arrest me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:53	gw9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὕτη ἐστὶν ὑμῶν ἡ ὥρα	1	Jesus is using the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “this is a time when you can do whatever you want” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:53	mzb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους	1	Jesus is using this phrase to characterize the **hour** further. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show that by repeating the reference to “time” from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “because it is a time when darkness is in authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
22:53	m577		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἡ ἐξουσία τοῦ σκότους	1	Jesus is referring figuratively to Satan as **darkness**. Alternate translation: “because it is a time when God is allowing Satan to do what he wants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
22:54	mtp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤγαγον	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state more explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “they led Jesus away from the place where they had arrested him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:54	m578		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὁ δὲ Πέτρος ἠκολούθει μακρόθεν	1	Luke provides this background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now Peter followed the group there, staying some distance away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
22:54	m579		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ δὲ Πέτρος ἠκολούθει μακρόθεν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly why Peter followed **from a distance**. Alternate translation: “Now Peter followed the group there, staying some distance away so that he would not be recognized and arrested himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:55	b3x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	περιαψάντων & πῦρ	1	Here the pronoun **they** does not mean the same thing as in the previous verse. Luke is not saying that the leaders and soldiers who had arrested Jesus built this fire. Rather, Luke is using the word **they** in an indefinite sense. Alternate translation: “some people had started a fire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
22:55	m580		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	περιαψάντων & πῦρ	1	Luke is using this phrase to introduce some new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “some of the people who were there at the high priest’s house had started a fire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
22:55	m581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πῦρ	1	Implicitly, the purpose of the **fire** was to keep the people warm during the cool night. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “a fire to keep warm” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:55	qx64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν μέσῳ τῆς αὐλῆς	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that in this culture, the courtyard of a house had walls around it, but no roof. You may wish to clarify this for your readers. This was an outdoor fire. Alternate translation: “in the middle of the open courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:55	m8ew			μέσος αὐτῶν	1	Alternate translation: “there together with them”
22:56	m582		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἰδοῦσα δὲ αὐτὸν, παιδίσκη τις	1	Luke says this to introduce this new character into the story. Alternate translation: “Now there was a female servant there who saw him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
22:56	fm4t			καθήμενον πρὸς τὸ φῶς	1	Alternate translation: “sitting facing the light of the fire” or “sitting with his face lit up by the fire”
22:56	fxz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἀτενίσασα αὐτῷ εἶπεν	1	Though this woman was looking at Peter, she was not speaking to him but to the others around them. It might be helpful to begin a new sentence here in your translation. Alternate translation: “She looked straight at Peter and said to the other people in the courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:56	zu63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ οὗτος σὺν αὐτῷ ἦν	1	This could mean: (1) Peter was with Jesus when the group came to arrest him, as UST suggests. (2) since it is perhaps unlikely that this female servant accompanied that group, she may mean instead that she saw Peter with Jesus somewhere in Jerusalem earlier in the week and she could tell that he was associated with Jesus. Alternate translation: “I know that this man is one of Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:57	dzq9			ὁ δὲ ἠρνήσατο	1	Alternate translation: “But Peter said that was not true”
22:57	vdm1			γύναι	1	Peter addresses the female servant as **Woman** because he does not know her name. He is not insulting her by calling her that. If your readers might think he was insulting her, you could use a way that is acceptable in your culture for a man to address a woman he does not know. Alternate translation: “Miss” or “Ma’am”
22:58	m583		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἕτερος	1	Luke uses this word to introduce another new character into the story. Alternate translation: “another of the people who was there by the fire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
22:58	i65s			καὶ σὺ ἐξ αὐτῶν εἶ	1	Alternate translation: “You are also one of the people who were with Jesus”
22:58	cyv7			ἄνθρωπε	1	Peter addresses this person as **Man** because he does not know his name. He is not insulting him by calling him that. If your readers might think he was insulting him, you could use a way that is acceptable in your culture for a man to address another man he does not know. Alternate translation: “Sir”
22:59	m584			διαστάσης ὡσεὶ ὥρας μιᾶς	1	You can express this in the way your language describes time. Alternate translation: “about an hour later”
22:59	m585		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἄλλος τις	1	Luke uses this expression to introduce a further character into the story. Alternate translation: “yet another of the people who was there by the fire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
22:59	h5tb			διϊσχυρίζετο	1	Alternate translation: “kept saying loudly”
22:59	fc42			οὗτος	1	The phrase **this one** refers to Peter. The speaker probably did not know Peter’s name. Alternate translation: “this man”
22:59	qwf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν	1	The man could probably tell Peter was from Galilee from the way he talked. If it wold be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for he speaks with a Galilean accent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:59	m586		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ γὰρ Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you put this phrase before the previous phrase, as UST does, since this phrase gives the reason for the conclusion that the previous phrase states. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
22:60	ck93			ἄνθρωπε	1	See how you translated **Man** in [22:58](../22/58.md). Peter did not know the man’s name. He was not insulting him by calling him **Man**. Alternate translation: “Sir”
22:60	al3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ οἶδα ὃ λέγεις	1	This is an idiom that means that Peter completely disagrees with the man. Alternate translation: “what you are saying is not true at all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:60	p6c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔτι λαλοῦντος αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Peter, not to the other man. Alternate translation: “while Peter was speaking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
22:60	lt62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐφώνησεν ἀλέκτωρ	1	See how you translated the similar phrase in [22:34](../22/34.md). You may have decided to use a general expression there. Alternate translation: “the birds began to sing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:61	gdp5			ὁ Κύριος & τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Luke is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Alternate translation in each case: “the Lord Jesus”
22:61	dpk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ ῥήματος τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Luke is using the term **word** figuratively to describe what Jesus had said using words. Alternate translation: “the statement Jesus had made” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
22:61	kkq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι	1	See how you translated this phrase in [22:60](../22/60.md) and the similar phrase in [22:34](../22/34.md). You may have decided to use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the birds begin to sing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:61	ui26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σήμερον	1	See how you translated **today** in [22:34](../22/34.md). The Jewish day started at sundown and continued to the next evening. Jesus had spoken the previous evening about what would happen shortly before dawn or at dawn, so this was still the same day. Alternate translation: “in the morning” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:61	zjc6			ἀπαρνήσῃ με τρίς	1	Alternate translation: “you will say three times that you do not know me”
22:62	m5gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξελθὼν ἔξω, ἔκλαυσεν πικρῶς	1	As the note to [22:55](../22/55.md) explains, this was an open-air courtyard, so the people in it were already outside in that sense. This expression means that Peter left the courtyard and went completely outside the house of the high priest. Alternate translation: “Peter went out of the courtyard and away from the house, and he wept bitterly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:63	abcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ συνέχοντες αὐτὸν, ἐνέπαιζον αὐτῷ δέροντες	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus in both cases. Alternate translation: “the soldiers who were guarding Jesus mocked and beat Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
22:64	zn1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	καὶ περικαλύψαντες αὐτὸν	1	A **blindfold** is a thick cloth that people tie around the middle of a person’s head to cover the eyes and prevent that person from seeing. If your readers would not be familiar with this, you could explain it with a general expression. Alternate translation: “They covered his eyes so that he could not see, and” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
22:64	cl2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	προφήτευσον, τίς ἐστιν ὁ παίσας σε?	1	The guards did not believe that Jesus was a prophet. Rather, they believed that a real prophet would know who hit him even if he could not see. When they called Jesus a prophet, they were saying the opposite of what they believed to be true. They were only calling him a prophet to mock him. Alternate translation: “Prove that you really are a prophet. Tell us who hit you!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
22:64	m587		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ἐστιν ὁ παίσας σε?	1	The guards do not expect Jesus to be able to answer their question. They are really using the question form to give a command, to tell Jesus what he should do if he wants to convince them that he is a prophet. So If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a command. Alternate translation: “Tell us who hit you!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:64	q4g1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προφήτευσον	1	The implication is that God would have to tell Jesus who struck him, since Jesus was blindfolded and could not see. Alternate translation: “Speak words from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:65	m588			βλασφημοῦντες	1	**Blaspheming** can have a technical sense, as it often does in this book. It can refer to a human being claiming to be God, as the Jewish leaders felt Jesus was doing in [5:21](../05/21.md). It can also refer to a human being wrongly denying that something is divine or of divine origin, as the Jewish leaders were afraid the people would consider them to be doing in [20:6](../20/06.md). By ironically suggesting that Jesus was not a true prophet, the soldiers actually were guilty of blasphemy in this technical sense. But the word can also have a general sense of “insult,” and that may be the sense in which Luke is using it here. Alternate translation: “insulting him”
22:66	v9m2			καὶ ὡς ἐγένετο ἡμέρα	1	Alternate translation: “As soon as it was light”
22:66	vp8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπήγαγον αὐτὸν εἰς τὸ Συνέδριον αὐτῶν	1	The pronoun **they** does not necessarily refer to **the elders**. Rather, since Jesus was in the custody of the guards, the elders would have had the guards bring Jesus in. Alternate translation: “the elders had Jesus brought into the Sanhedrin” or “the guards led Jesus into the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

22:67	g8iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐὰν ὑμῖν εἴπω, οὐ μὴ πιστεύσητε	1	Jesus is using a hypothetical situation to avoid answering the question directly, since that might give the elders a reason to say that he was guilty of blasphemy for claiming to be the Messiah.

22:68	l7nz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἐὰν δὲ ἐρωτήσω, οὐ μὴ ἀποκριθῆτε	1	Jesus is using a further hypothetical situation to avoid answering the question directly, in order not to give the elders a reason to say that he was guilty of blasphemy.

22:69	p8kt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus is referring to himself in the third person.

22:69	m592		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated the title **Son of Man** in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “I, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

22:69	nka9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐκ δεξιῶν τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	To sit at the **right hand … of God** means to receive great honor and authority from God. Alternate translation: “in a place of honor next to the all-powerful God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
22:69	h4n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This expression is like a hendiadys, in which two nouns are used together and one of them describes the other. Alternate translation: “the powerful God” or “the all-powerful God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
22:70	udh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σὺ οὖν εἶ ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	The council asked this question because they wanted Jesus to confirm explicitly their understanding that he was saying he was the Son of God. Alternate translation: “So when you said that, did you mean that you are the Son of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
22:70	l4j7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This is an important title that Jesus deserves, even though the elders did not think he deserved it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
22:70	jtr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὑμεῖς λέγετε ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι	1	This is an idiom. Jesus is using it to acknowledge that what the elders are asking about is true. Alternate translation: “Yes, it is just as you say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
22:71	u3m3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἔτι ἔχομεν μαρτυρίας χρείαν?	1	The elders are using the question form for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “We have no further need for testimony!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:71	m594		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ἔτι ἔχομεν μαρτυρίας χρείαν?	1	The implications are that no further testimony is needed to prove a charge of blasphemy.

22:71	m595		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἔχομεν & αὐτοὶ & ἠκούσαμεν	1	The elders are speaking to one another about themselves, so **we** and **ourselves** would be exclusive, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
22:71	m596		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἠκούσαμεν ἀπὸ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you put this phrase before the previous phrase, as UST does, since this phrase gives the reason for the conclusion that the previous phrase states.

23:intro	p6wq				0	# Luke 23 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus stands trial before Pilate and Herod (23:1-25)\n2. The Roman soldiers crucify Jesus (23:26-49)\n3. Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus and women prepare spices (23:50-56)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”\n\nThe curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried (Luke 23:53) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise”\n\nThere are two translation issues related to the statement, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise” in [23:42](../23/42.md).\n\n(1) When Jesus said this to the criminal who was crucified with him, it is possible that he was using the term **paradise** figuratively to mean “heaven,” describing it by association with the way that it is a place of comfort and consolation. Some groups of believers would understand it that way. However, other groups of believers would say that people who express their faith in Jesus, as this criminal did, still need to wait until the final resurrection before they go to heaven, and so **paradise** refers to a place where such people go when they die and await the final resurrection. Be sensitive to this difference in your translation. You may decide it is best simply to use the term **paradise** and leave the meaning open to either understanding. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n(2) Some groups that may be active in your area, such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses, do not honor Jesus as the Son of God, and so they do not believe that he would have been able to promise the criminal entrance into paradise with himself that day, when they both would die. And so they translate or punctuate this so that the word **today** describes when Jesus is making the statement, rather than when the criminal will be in paradise. However, if that were actually the case, the Greek wording and word order would be different. The expression that introduces the statement would be, “Truly, today, I say to you,” or, “Truly I say to you today that.” The actual expression, “Truly I say to you,” occurs ten times in the book of Luke, and it always stands by itself as an introduction to a statement that follows. So **today** belongs with the statement, not with the introduction to the statement. Your language may have a way of making this clear, for example, by saying, “Truly I say to you, you will be with me in paradise today.”\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “And he was obligated to release one to them at every feast” [23:17](../23/17.md)\n\nThis verse is not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible. Most scholars consider it to be a later addition for explanation. Many current versions of the Bible do not include it. Some versions put it into square brackets. We recommend that you do not translate this verse. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in your region that include this verse, you may include it.\n\n### “Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.’” [23:34](../23/34.md)\n\nThis sentence is not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible, and so it is likely not an original part of the Gospel of Luke. However, many scholars consider it an authentic saying of Jesus that was copied into the book at an early stage. ULT and UST include this sentence in this verse, but some other versions do not.\n\nIf you decide to include either [23:17](../23/17.md) or the additional sentence [23:34](../23/34.md) in your translation, you should enclose the material in square brackets to indicate that it is probably not original to Luke’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
23:1	pi3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to indicate that this event came after the events he has just described. Alternate translation (as in UST): “Then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
23:1	sgf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἅπαν τὸ πλῆθος αὐτῶν	1	The word **whole** is a generalization. Luke says in [23:51](../23/51.md) that at least one member of the Sanhedrin did not agree that Jesus was guilty of blasphemy and should be punished. Alternate translation: “the many members of the ruling council who wanted to condemn Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
23:1	mvn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀναστὰν	1	This means literally that they “stood up” or “stood to their feet,” but figuratively by extension it means that they adjourned the meeting and left the meeting place. Alternate translation: “ended the meeting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:1	k4aa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τὸν Πειλᾶτον	1	The implication is that the Jewish leaders brought Jesus to Pilate because they wanted Pilate to judge him. Alternate translation: “to Pilate so that Pilate would judge him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:1	m598		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Πειλᾶτον	1	**Pilate** is the name of the man who was the Roman ruler of Judea in this time. See how you translated his name in [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:2	m599		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατηγορεῖν αὐτοῦ	1	The chief priests and scribes accused Jesus of doing wrong things because they wanted Pilate to kill Jesus. But they were accusing him falsely, because Jesus had never done what they accused him of doing. For example, in [20:25](../20/25.md), Jesus had specifically said that the Jews could pay taxes to the Roman government. To make sure that your readers are not confused, you could state explicitly that these accusations were false. Alternate translation: “to accuse him falsely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:2	mtc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	εὕρομεν & τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν	1	The terms **we** and **our** refer only the members of the Jewish ruling council who are speaking, not to Pilate or any of the other people nearby. So in your translation, use the exclusive forms of these words, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
23:2	im4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διαστρέφοντα τὸ ἔθνος ἡμῶν	1	The Jewish leaders speak figuratively of Jesus as if he were a guide who was leading someone in the wrong direction. Alternate translation: “encouraging our people to do things that are wrong” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:2	xsa4			κωλύοντα φόρους & διδόναι	1	Alternate translation: “telling them not to pay taxes”
23:2	l68k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Καίσαρι	1	See how you translated **Caesar** in [20:22](../20/22.md). The Jewish leaders are referring figuratively to the Roman government by Caesar’s name, since he was its ruler. Alternate translation: “to the Roman government” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:3	m600		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ & ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτῷ ἔφη	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to what Pilate asked him. Alternate translation: “Jesus responded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
23:3	ve4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σὺ λέγεις	1	Like the similar expression in [22:70](../22/70.md), this is an idiom. Jesus is using it to acknowledge that what Pilate has said is true. Alternate translation: “Yes, it is as you say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:4	fx7d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	καὶ τοὺς ὄχλους	1	Luke uses this phrase subtly within the narrative to introduce these new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “and to the crowds that had gathered there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
23:4	s8fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδὲν εὑρίσκω αἴτιον ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ	1	Pilate means implicitly **no cause** to convict Jesus of a crime and punish him. Alternate translation: “I do not find this man to be guilty of anything” or “I find no grounds for conviction in this man’s case” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:5	m601		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οἱ & ἐπίσχυον	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the Jewish leaders who had brought Jesus to Pilate for trial. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders kept insisting” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:5	yy6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀνασείει τὸν λαὸν	1	The Jewish leaders speak figuratively as if Jesus were stirring a pot and putting in motion things that had been lying quietly on the bottom. They mean that he is encouraging rebellion. Alternate translation: “He encourages the people to rebel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:5	cr78			καὶ ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας ἕως ὧδε	1	It might be helpful to make this a new sentence. Alternate translation: “He began causing trouble in Galilee, and he has done so all the way to here”
23:6	vvp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Πειλᾶτος & ἀκούσας	1	As the rest of the verse shows, this refers implicitly to Pilate hearing that Jesus had begun teaching in Galilee. Alternate translation: “when Pilate heard that Jesus had begun to teach in Galilee” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:6	px94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	ἐπηρώτησεν εἰ ὁ ἄνθρωπος Γαλιλαῖός ἐστιν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could represent this as a direct quotation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
23:6	dr1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	The term **the man** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:7	cbn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς ὅτι	1	The implication is that the Jewish leaders answered Pilate’s question and confirmed that Jesus came from Galilee. Alternate translation: “when the Jewish leaders confirmed to Pilate that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:7	mn6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τῆς ἐξουσίας Ἡρῴδου ἐστὶν	1	The implication is that Jesus was under Herod’s authority because Herod was the ruler of Galilee. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus was under the authority of Herod, since Herod ruled over Galilee” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:7	ay2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνέπεμψεν αὐτὸν πρὸς Ἡρῴδην	1	The implication seems to be that Pilate used these grounds to get someone else to decide Jesus’ case. He did not want to decide it himself, because he would either have to release someone the Jewish leaders wanted condemned or else condemn someone he knew was innocent. Alternate translation: “he referred Jesus’ case to Herod so that he would not have to decide it himself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:7	ys2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταύταις ταῖς ἡμέραις	1	Luke is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:8	z3zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	θέλων ἰδεῖν αὐτὸν & διὰ τὸ ἀκούειν περὶ αὐτοῦ	1	In these phrases, **he** refers to Herod and **him** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “wanting to see Jesus … because he had heard about Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:8	b424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤλπιζέν τι σημεῖον ἰδεῖν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ γινόμενον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Herod wanted to see Jesus perform a miracle” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:9	hbp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπηρώτα & αὐτὸν ἐν λόγοις ἱκανοῖς	1	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to refer to what Herod said as he questioned Jesus. Alternate translation: “Herod asked Jesus many questions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:9	c8li			οὐδὲν ἀπεκρίνατο αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the verb negative and the object positive here. Alternate translation: “Jesus did not say anything in reply”
23:10	lpu6			ἵστήκεισαν	1	Alternate translation: “were standing there”
23:10	hn8g			εὐτόνως κατηγοροῦντες αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “insisting strongly that Jesus was guilty of doing wrong”
23:11	m602			ἐξουθενήσας & αὐτὸν	1	This does not mean that Herod hated Jesus, but that he treated him as if he were worthless. Alternate translation: “humiliated him”
23:11	qt1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περιβαλὼν ἐσθῆτα λαμπρὰν	1	Herod and his soldiers did this to mock Jesus and to make fun of him, so be sure that your readers do not get the impression that they did this to honor or care for Jesus. Alternate translation: “Dressing him mockingly in beautiful clothes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:12	b6f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγένοντο & φίλοι ὅ τε Ἡρῴδης καὶ ὁ Πειλᾶτος ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ μετ’ ἀλλήλων	1	Luke does not say specifically why these two men **became friends**. This could mean: (1) Pilate had shown Herod courtesy by respecting his jurisdiction over Jesus. Alternate translation: “Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because Pilate had respectfully sent Jesus to Herod to judge him” (2) they realized that they agreed in their opinion about Jesus. They both felt that he was not guilty of doing wrong, but they also felt they could mistreat him as a way of asserting their power and authority over someone the people considered a leader. Alternate translation: “Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day because they had both responded to Jesus in the same way” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:12	x7r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	προϋπῆρχον γὰρ ἐν ἔχθρᾳ ὄντες πρὸς αὑτούς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this clause first in the verse, as UST does, since it gives the reason for the results that the rest of the verse describes. These two men had to become **friends** because they had not been **friends** previously. Alternate translation, as the beginning of the verse, replacing “Then”: “Before this Herod and Pilate had been enemies, but now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
23:13	d7gn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	τὸν λαὸν	1	This is a further reference reintroducing these participants, whom Luke first introduced subtly in 23:4. It is not likely that Pilate asked a crowd to gather. Instead, the crowd was probably still there waiting to see what would happen to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the crowd of people that was still there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
23:14	dh77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς, προσηνέγκατέ μοι τὸν ἄνθρωπον τοῦτον	1	By **this man**, Pilate means Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “said to them about Jesus, ‘You brought this man to me’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:14	wsw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὡς ἀποστρέφοντα τὸν λαόν	1	Here Pilate uses a figurative term that is similar to the one that the council members use in [23:2](../23/02.md) when they accuse Jesus of “misleading” the Jewish nation, meaning that he was encouraging them to do wrong things. The slightly different term that Pilate uses to summarize their charges means that they accused Jesus of **turning the people away** from their duties to the Roman Empire. It does not mean that Jesus refused to welcome people who came to him for help. Alternate translation: “saying that he encourages the people to be disloyal to the Roman Empire” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:14	m603		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Pilate uses the term **behold** to get the Jewish leaders and the crowd to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:14	m604		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀνακρίνας	1	For emphasis, since he is declaring Jesus innocent, Pilate uses the personal pronoun **I** here when it would not ordinarily be required in Greek. If your language uses pronouns in this same way, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:14	m605		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀνακρίνας, οὐθὲν εὗρον	1	The term **before** figuratively means “in the presence” of another person. Alternate translation: “I have questioned him in your presence, and I have found nothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:14	ee53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγὼ ἐνώπιον ὑμῶν ἀνακρίνας, οὐθὲν εὗρον	1	The implication is that the Jewish leaders were witnesses to the proceedings. Alternate translation: “I have questioned him with you present as witnesses, and I have found nothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:14	e517			οὐθὲν εὗρον ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ τούτῳ αἴτιον ὧν κατηγορεῖτε κατ’ αὐτοῦ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [23:4](../23/04.md). Alternate translation: “found no grounds to convict this man on the charges you are making against him”
23:15	h623		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ Ἡρῴδης	1	Here Pilate is speaking in an abbreviated way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could clarify his meaning by adding information from the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “But Herod did not find any grounds to convict him either” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
23:15	bn7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀνέπεμψεν γὰρ αὐτὸν πρὸς ἡμᾶς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this clause first in the verse, as UST does, since it gives the reason why it is clear that Herod did not consider Jesus guilty. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
23:15	i2ba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	πρὸς ἡμᾶς	1	Pilate means that Herod sent Jesus back not just to him and his soldiers, but also to the Jewish leaders who were the accusers in this trial. Since Pilate is speaking specifically to those leaders (he says in the previous verse, “You brought this man to me”), the word **us** includes the addressees. So it would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
23:15	gs4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν ἄξιον θανάτου ἐστὶν πεπραγμένον αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he has not done anything to deserve being put to death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:16	p5wa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παιδεύσας οὖν αὐτὸν, ἀπολύσω	1	Your readers may find this hard to understand. Since Pilate had found Jesus not guilty, he should have released him without punishing him. The implications are that Pilate punished Jesus anyway, even though he knew he was innocent, to try to satisfy the Jewish leaders. However, since Luke does not provide this explanation in his book, you probably should not add it to your translation. But you could make explicit that Pilate is saying he is not going to execute Jesus. Alternate translation: “So I will not execute him, but whip him, and then let him go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:16	m606		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	παιδεύσας & αὐτὸν	1	Pilate will not administer this punishment personally. Rather, he will have his soldiers do it. Alternate translation: “after having my soldiers whip him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
23:17	m607		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	Ἀνάγκην δὲ εἶχεν ἀπολύειν αὐτοῖς κατὰ ἑορτὴν ἕνα	1	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this verse in your translation. The notes below discuss translation issues in the verse, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
23:17	m608		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	This verse uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what is happening. In the previous verse, Pilate was saying that Jesus would be the prisoner he was obligated to release. But in the next verse, the crowd shouts for him to release a different man instead. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
23:17	m609		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Ἀνάγκην & εἶχεν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Pilate. Alternate translation: “Pilate was obligated” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:17	m610		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἕνα	1	This verse is using the adjective **one** as a noun. In context, the term clearly means **one** prisoner. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could supply the noun for clarity, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:17	m611		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	κατὰ ἑορτὴν	1	This verse uses the general term **feast** to mean one feast in particular, Passover. Alternate translation: “during each Passover celebration” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
23:18	v7pf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀνέκραγον & πανπληθεὶ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people in the crowd. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd shouted together” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:18	ib9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	αἶρε τοῦτον	1	This is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate it as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to execute this man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
23:18	m612		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἀπόλυσον δὲ ἡμῖν τὸν Βαραββᾶν	1	This is another imperative, and since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this either, you could also translate it as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “and we want you to set Barabbas free instead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
23:18	i6pj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἀπόλυσον & ἡμῖν	1	When the people in the crowd say **us**, they are referring to themselves only, not to Pilate and his soldiers as well. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive **us,** you would use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
23:18	m613		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Βαραββᾶν	1	**Barabbas** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:19	vd6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὅστις ἦν διὰ στάσιν τινὰ γενομένην ἐν τῇ πόλει καὶ φόνον, βληθεὶς ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ	1	Luke provides this background information to explain to his readers who Barabbas was. Alternate translation: “Now Barabbas was a man whom the Romans had put in prison because he had led a rebellion in Jerusalem and he had killed people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
23:19	qdv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅστις ἦν & βληθεὶς ἐν τῇ φυλακῇ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “The Romans had put him in prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:19	zl1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ στάσιν τινὰ γενομένην ἐν τῇ πόλει	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly that Barabbas led this rebellion against the Roman government. Alternate translation: “because he had led a rebellion in Jerusalem against the Roman government” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:20	vbp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πάλιν & προσεφώνησεν αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the religious leaders who had accused Jesus and the crowd that was shouting for him to be executed. Alternate translation: “spoke again to the religious leaders and to the people in the crowd” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:20	t1i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	θέλων ἀπολῦσαι τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this phrase before the previous one, as UST does, since it gives the reason why Pilate spoke to the leaders and the crowd again. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
23:21	m614		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σταύρου, σταύρου αὐτόν	1	As a note to [14:27](../14/27.md) explains, the Romans executed some criminals by nailing them to a wooden beam with crossbar and setting the beam upright so that the criminals would slowly suffocate. That was what it meant to **crucify** someone. Alternate translation: “Nail him to a cross! Execute him!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:21	m615		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	σταύρου, σταύρου αὐτόν	1	This is an imperative, but since the crowd cannot command Pilate to do this, you could translate it as an expression of what they want. Alternate translation: “We want you to nail him to a cross to execute him!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
23:22	iz5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὁ & τρίτον εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “Pilate spoke to the crowd again, for time number three” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
23:22	ck75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί γὰρ κακὸν ἐποίησεν οὗτος?	1	Pilate does not expect the crowd to tell him what Jesus has done wrong. Rather, he is using the question form to emphasize to the crowd that Jesus is innocent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is no reason to execute this man, because he has not done anything wrong!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
23:22	de5a			οὐδὲν αἴτιον θανάτου εὗρον ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Alternate translation: “I have not found any grounds to convict him of a crime for which he should be executed”
23:22	mij1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παιδεύσας οὖν αὐτὸν, ἀπολύσω	1	See the note to this same sentence in [23:16](../23/16.md). Pilate should have released Jesus without punishment, because he was innocent. It seems that Pilate decided to punish Jesus anyway to try to satisfy the Jewish leaders. However, since Luke does not provide this explanation in his book, you probably should not add it to your translation. But you could make explicit that Pilate is saying he is not going to execute Jesus. Alternate translation: “So I will not execute him, but whip him, and then let him go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:22	m616		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	παιδεύσας & αὐτὸν, ἀπολύσω	1	Pilate is not going to administer this punishment personally. Rather, he will have his soldiers do it. Alternate translation: “I will have my soldiers whip him, and then I will release him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
23:23	sni4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	φωναῖς μεγάλαις	1	Luke is describing the shouts of the crowd figuratively by reference to the **voices** that the people used to make them. Alternate translation: “with loud shouts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:23	pst8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτὸν σταυρωθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “that Pilate have his soldiers crucify Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:23	pgz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	κατίσχυον αἱ φωναὶ αὐτῶν	1	Luke speaks figuratively of the **voices** as if they were a living thing that actively overcame Pilate’s reluctance. Alternate translation: “the crowd kept shouting until they convinced Pilate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
23:24	m617		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Because the people in the crowd overcame his reluctance with their shouts, Pilate agreed to do what they wanted. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
23:24	tfw2			γενέσθαι τὸ αἴτημα αὐτῶν	1	Alternate translation: “to do what the crowd was demanding”
23:25	nwd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν & βεβλημένον εἰς φυλακὴν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly that this means Barabbas. Alternate translation: “Barabbas, whom the Romans had put in prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:25	t66f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βεβλημένον εἰς φυλακὴν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom the Romans had put in prison” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:25	z8v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν παρέδωκεν τῷ θελήματι αὐτῶν	1	Luke speaks figuratively of the **will** of the people as if it were a living thing into whose custody Pilate delivered Jesus. Alternate translation: “but he ordered his soldiers to do to Jesus what the crowd had demanded” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
23:26	s9kc			ὡς ἀπήγαγον αὐτόν	1	Alternate translation: “while the soldiers were leading Jesus away from where Pilate had judged him”
23:26	ysu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπιλαβόμενοι Σίμωνά & ἐπέθηκαν	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that Roman soldiers had the authority to compel people to carry their loads. Be sure that your translation does not suggest that the soldiers arrested Simon or that he had done anything wrong. Alternate translation: “making use of their authority, they conscripted Simon … and put” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:26	m618		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	Σίμωνά, τινα Κυρηναῖον ἐρχόμενον ἀπ’ ἀγροῦ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could treat this information about this man, where he was from, and what he was doing as background information and put it first in the verse, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
23:26	m619		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Σίμωνά, τινα Κυρηναῖον	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce this new character into the story. Alternate translation: “a man named Simon, who was from the city of Cyrene” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
23:26	x5qz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σίμωνά	1	**Simon** is the name of a man. See how you translated his name in [4:38](../04/38.md). (It is the same name there, even though it is the name of a different person.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:26	m620		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Κυρηναῖον	1	The term **Cyrenean** is a name that refers to a person who is from the city of Cyrene. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:26	i5ua			ἐρχόμενον ἀπ’ ἀγροῦ	1	Alternate translation: “who was coming into Jerusalem from the countryside”
23:26	fub3			ἐπέθηκαν αὐτῷ τὸν σταυρὸν	1	Alternate translation: “the soldiers put the cross on his shoulders”
23:26	y3p6			ὄπισθεν τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “and made him walk along behind Jesus carrying it”
23:27	ad9f			ἠκολούθει & αὐτῷ πολὺ πλῆθος τοῦ λαοῦ, καὶ γυναικῶν	1	The women were part of the large crowd. They were not in a separate crowd of their own. Alternate translation: “a great crowd of people, which included women, was following him”
23:27	s7gx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ γυναικῶν αἳ ἐκόπτοντο καὶ ἐθρήνουν αὐτόν	1	Luke provides this background information to help readers understand what happens next, when Jesus speaks to these women. It might be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Now the crowd included women who were mourning and wailing for Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
23:27	m621		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐκόπτοντο	1	See the note to **mourning** at [8:52](../08/52.md), and see how you translated this word there. It could mean that the women were pounding on their chests as a sign of grief, as was customary in this culture, or it could mean more generally that they were expressing their sorrow over what was happening to Jesus. Alternate translation: “pounding on their chests” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
23:27	bp3x			ἠκολούθει & αὐτῷ	1	Here, the word **following** is not figurative. It does not mean that these people were Jesus’ disciples. Alternate translation: “were walking along behind him”
23:28	nl38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	θυγατέρες Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	As in [13:34](../13/34.md), Jesus is figuratively describing people who live in Jerusalem as if they were the children of the city and it was their mother. Alternate translation: “You women who live in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:28	wi15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐφ’ ἑαυτὰς κλαίετε, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰ τέκνα ὑμῶν	1	Jesus does not say specifically why the women should weep for themselves and for their children, but the implication from what he says in [23:31](../23/31.md) is that they should weep because even worse things are going to happen to them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “weep for yourselves and for your children, because even worse things are going to happen to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:29	s9uj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	ὅτι	1	Jesus is giving the reason why the women of Jerusalem should weep for themselves and their children, as he told them to do in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could put this reason before the result by combining this verse and the previous one into a verse bridge. See the suggestions in the note about the similar situation in [22:16](../22/16.md) for how you might do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
23:29	rd8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Jesus is using the term **behold** to get the women to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Alternate translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:29	bjb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἔρχονται ἡμέραι ἐν αἷς	1	Jesus is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “there will be a time when” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:29	xi9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν αἷς ἐροῦσιν	1	Here Jesus is using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense. He does not have specific individuals in mind. Alternate translation: “when people will say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:29	m622		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐροῦσιν, μακάριαι αἱ στεῖραι, καὶ αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν, καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “people will say that women are fortunate if they never had children, if they never gave birth or nursed babies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
23:29	rgj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	αἱ στεῖραι, καὶ αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν, καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν	1	After speaking of women who were **barren**, that is, who did not have children, Jesus describes the same women in more detail. He is likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases, as UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
23:29	m623		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	αἱ κοιλίαι αἳ οὐκ ἐγέννησαν, καὶ μαστοὶ οἳ οὐκ ἔθρεψαν	1	These are two figures of speech in which Jesus is using one part of a person to represent the entire person. Alternate translation: “women who have never given birth or nursed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
23:30	te1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	τότε	1	Here, **then** does not mean that people would say this after what they said in the previous verse. Rather, it means that they would say this at the same time that they were saying that. Alternate translation: “At that time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
23:30	u1x1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἄρξονται λέγειν	1	Here Jesus is likely using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense, as in the previous verse. He probably does not have specific individuals in mind. However, the general reference may be to the people of Jerusalem, as UST suggests. Alternate translation: “people will begin to say” or “the people of Jerusalem will begin to say” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:30	m624		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	λέγειν τοῖς ὄρεσιν, πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς; καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	Jesus is saying that at this time people will figuratively address something they know cannot hear them in order to express in a strong way what they are feeling. Alternate translation: “to say that they wished the mountains would fall on them and the hills would cover them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
23:30	m625		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγειν τοῖς ὄρεσιν, πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς; καὶ τοῖς βουνοῖς, καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “to tell the mountains to fall on them and the hills to cover them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
23:30	m626		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς & καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	This is an imperative, but since the people cannot order the mountains and hills to do this, they would be using the imperative to express their wishes. Alternate translation: “We wish you would fall on us … We wish you would cover us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
23:30	m627		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς & καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	The people do not want the mountains and hills to fall on them to harm them, but rather to protect them. Alternate translation: “We wish you would fall on us to protect us … We wish you would cover us to protect us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:30	m628		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	πέσετε ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς & καλύψατε ἡμᾶς	1	When the people say **us**, they are referring to themselves only, not to the mountains and hills as well. So here, use the exclusive form of **us** if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
23:31	nkk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅτι εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ, ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν; ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ, τί γένηται?	1	This is a figure of speech based on the idea that dry wood catches fire much more easily than moist wood. The fire, in turn, represents terrible things that people will experience. Jesus is saying that under the present relatively stable conditions, it was difficult for his enemies to arrest him and sentence him to death. In the future, conditions will become so desperate and chaotic that people will be able to do much worse things much more easily. He is probably referring to what conditions will be like during the siege and destruction of Jerusalem, which he described in [21:20-24](../21/20.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the meaning of this metaphor in your translation, and you could represent the metaphor itself as a simile, as UST does. Alternate translation: “If people are able to do this when conditions are good, what will they do when conditions become very bad?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:31	y238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ὅτι εἰ ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ, ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν; ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ, τί γένηται?	1	Jesus does not expect the women to tell him what people will do in the future. Rather, he is using the question form for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Since people are doing this when conditions are good, they will certainly do much worse when conditions become very bad!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
23:31	m629		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ταῦτα ποιοῦσιν	1	Here Jesus is using the pronoun **they** in an indefinite sense. Alternate translation: “people are doing these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:31	m630		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ξύλῳ	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “when the wood is fresh” or “when the wood is wet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:31	m631		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ξύλῳ	1	Jesus is using the term **tree** figuratively to refer to wood that comes from a **tree**. Alternate translation: “wood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:31	m632		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ξύλῳ	1	A **tree** is a large plant with a hard exterior that people use for fuel and as building material. If your readers would not know what a **tree** is, or if people do not use wood from a **tree** as fuel in your area, you could use the name of something else that they use for fuel, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “burning material” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:31	zt5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “when the wood is dry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:31	m633		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐν τῷ ξηρῷ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **dry** as a noun. In context, the term means **dry** wood. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could supply the noun for clarity. Alternate translation: “with dry wood” or “when the wood is dry” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:32	m634		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
23:32	w8yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἤγοντο & καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο σὺν αὐτῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who was doing the action. Alternate translation: “with him the soldiers were also leading away two other men, who were criminals,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:32	m635		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	ἤγοντο & καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο	1	If your language does use passive verb forms, and if it also uses a dual form, this verb should be in the dual form if it is passive, since the two criminals would be the subject. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
23:32	m636		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἤγοντο δὲ καὶ ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce these new characters into the story. Alternate translation: “And there were two other men, who were criminals, who were also being led away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
23:32	m2nh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ἕτεροι κακοῦργοι δύο	1	This does not mean “two other criminals,” which would imply that Jesus was also a criminal. Jesus was innocent, even though the Romans were treating him as if he were a criminal. Be sure that this distinction is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “two other men, who actually were criminals” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
23:32	m637		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναιρεθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “so that they could execute them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:33	wj2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὅτε ἦλθον ἐπὶ τὸν τόπον	1	The pronoun **they** includes the soldiers, the criminals, and Jesus. Alternate translation: “when they all arrived at the place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:33	m638		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν καλούμενον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that people call” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:33	m639		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Κρανίον	1	**The Skull** is the name of a place. Even though it consists of an article and a common noun, translate it following the conventions of your language for names. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:33	i3vx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτὸν	1	In this case the pronoun **they** refers to the Roman soldiers. Alternate translation: “the Roman soldiers crucified Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:33	m640		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτὸν	1	See how you translated the term “crucify” in [23:21](../23/21.md). Alternate translation: “the Roman soldiers nailed Jesus to a cross to execute him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:33	bjr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὃν μὲν ἐκ δεξιῶν, ὃν δὲ ἐξ ἀριστερῶν	1	Luke is using the adjectives **right** and **left** as nouns to indicate locations. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could supply a noun such as “side” for clarity. Alternate translation: “they crucified one criminal at Jesus’ right side and the other criminal at Jesus’ left side” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:34	m641		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing”	0	See the discussion of textual issues at the end of the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to include this sentence in your translation. The next four notes below discuss translation issues in the sentence, for those who decide to include it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
23:34	m642		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce a contrast between what the Roman soldiers were doing to Jesus and the way in which Jesus responded. It would appropriate to indicate a strong contrast here. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
23:34	m643		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing	0	If it would be helpful in your language, you could reverse the order of the phrases in Jesus’ prayer, since the first phrase gives the reason for the result that Jesus is requesting in the second phrase. Alternate translation: “Father, they do not know what they are doing, so please forgive them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
23:34	m644		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Father	0	This is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
23:34	m645		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	forgive them	0	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request, rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please forgive them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
23:34	qbj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	διαμεριζόμενοι δὲ τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτοῦ, ἔβαλον κλῆρον	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the Roman soldiers. Alternate translation: “Then the Roman soldiers threw lots to decide which of them would get each piece of Jesus’ clothing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:34	uk4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἔβαλον κλῆρον	1	The term **lots** refers to objects with different markings on various sides that were used to decide randomly among several possibilities. They were tossed onto the ground to see which marked side would come up on top. If your readers would not be familiar with **lots**, you could state that they were “something like dice,” as UST does. But if your readers would also not be familiar with dice, then you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the Roman soldiers gambled” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:35	a2h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἵστήκει, ὁ λαὸς θεωρῶν ἐξεμυκτήριζον, δὲ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες	1	The implication is that the **people** who **stood by watching** were also **ridiculing** Jesus. Alternate translation: “People had come to watch the crucifixion and they ridiculed Jesus, and the Jewish leaders ridiculed him as well” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:35	m646		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ ἄρχοντες	1	**Rulers** refers specifically to the Jewish leaders, not to the Roman **rulers** of the area. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:35	t7mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν	1	Here the Jewish leaders are using irony. They do not really believe that Jesus **saved** other people. Alternate translation: “He supposedly saved other people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
23:35	m647		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν	1	In context, the Jewish leaders are implicitly referring to how Jesus **saved** others by doing miracles on their behalf. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “He supposedly saved other people by doing miracles for them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:35	m648		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ἄλλους ἔσωσεν, σωσάτω ἑαυτόν, εἰ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστὸς, τοῦ Θεοῦ, ὁ ἐκλεκτός	1	The Jewish leaders are mockingly suggesting a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose he really is the Messiah whom God has sent. Then he ought to be able to save himself; after all, he supposedly saved others” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
23:35	m3f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σωσάτω ἑαυτόν	1	The implication is that Jesus ought to be able to save himself from dying on the cross, if he is the Messiah and can do miracles. Alternate translation: “let him do a miracle to save himself from dying on the cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:35	a963		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ ἐκλεκτός	1	The leaders are using the adjective **Chosen** as a noun. ULT adds the term **One** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the One whom God has chosen” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:35	m649		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ὁ ἐκλεκτός	1	This is a title, not a description, so translate it following the conventions in your language for titles, for example, by capitalizing the main words. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:36	b3jz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐνέπαιξαν δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ οἱ στρατιῶται, προσερχόμενοι ὄξος προσφέροντες αὐτῷ	1	Luke does not say specifically in what way the soliders **mocked** Jesus by offering him **vinegar**, that is, the sour wine that was their common drink. This could mean: (1) since Luke records in the next verse that the soldiers spoke of Jesus being the “king of the Jews,” the common drink may have been intended to show that they did not really believe he was a king, since a king would have drunk fine wine. Alternate translation: “Then the soldiers also mocked him by coming and offering him cheap sour wine, which was not what a real king would drink” (2) the soldiers may have **mocked** Jesus just by **offering** him something to drink, but then not giving it to him, even though he would have been very thirsty. Alternate translation: “Then the soldiers also mocked him by coming and offering him some of their sour wine but then not giving him any to drink” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:37	x5wr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ σὺ εἶ ὁ Βασιλεὺς τῶν Ἰουδαίων, σῶσον σεαυτόν	1	The soldiers are mockingly suggesting a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Suppose you really are the King of the Jews. Then save yourself” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
23:37	m650		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σῶσον σεαυτόν	1	The implication is that Jesus ought to be able to save himself from dying on the cross. Alternate translation: “do a miracle to save yourself from dying on that cross” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:38	l5be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἦν δὲ καὶ ἐπιγραφὴ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ	1	Luke is referring figuratively to a placard that the soldiers placed above Jesus by association with the fact that it bore an **inscription**, that is, something that the soldiers had written on it. Alternate translation: “The soldiers also attached a placard at the top of Jesus’ cross on which they had written” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:38	w7aw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ἦν δὲ καὶ ἐπιγραφὴ ἐπ’ αὐτῷ	1	The soliders did not really believe that Jesus was **the King of the Jews**. Rather, putting up this placard was another of the ways in which they mocked him. So the sign said the opposite of what the people who wrote it actually believed. Alternate translation: “the soldiers also attached a placard at the top of Jesus’ cross on which they had written mockingly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
23:39	m651		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κρεμασθέντων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom the soldiers had hung on a cross next to Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:39	z9ej			ἐβλασφήμει αὐτόν	1	As in [22:65](../22/65.md), the term **blasphemed** here likely has the general sense of “insulted,” although technically this criminal was guilty of blasphemy in the more specific sense, since he was suggesting that Jesus was not the Messiah. Alternate translation: “insulted him”
23:39	tmy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ σὺ εἶ ὁ Χριστός?	1	The criminal is using the question form to mock Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I thought you were supposed to be the Messiah!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
23:39	g6uk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	σῶσον σεαυτὸν καὶ ἡμᾶς	1	The criminal did not really think that Jesus could rescue himself and the two criminals from dying by crucifixion. Instead, he is telling Jesus to do this in order to suggest that Jesus actually cannot do it. So he is saying the opposite of what he actually believes. Alternate translation: “But it looks like you can’t save yourself or us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
23:39	m652		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	Since this criminal is using the term **us** to mean himself and the other criminal, but not Jesus, the term **us** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
23:40	lb4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ ἕτερος ἐπιτιμῶν αὐτῷ ἔφη	1	Together the two words **answering** and **said** mean that the second criminal rebuked the first one in response to what he said to Jesus. You could combine these words into a single expression. Alternate translation: “But the other criminal responded, rebuking him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
23:40	m653		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ ἕτερος	1	Luke is using the adjective **other** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could supply the noun “criminal” for clarity. Alternate translation: “the other criminal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:40	nk1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐδὲ φοβῇ σὺ τὸν Θεόν, ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ?	1	The second criminal does not expect the first criminal to tell him whether he fears God. Rather, the second criminal is using the question form to rebuke the first criminal. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You ought to fear God, since you are dying on a cross just as he is!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
23:40	m654		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐδὲ φοβῇ σὺ τὸν Θεόν, ὅτι ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ?	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could bring out the implications of this statement more explicitly. Alternate translation: “You ought to fear God and show more respect for this godly man, since you are dying on a cross just as he is, and you will soon have to face God and answer for your actions!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:40	m655		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ κρίματι εἶ	1	The second criminal is using the word **judgment** figuratively to mean the punishment to which the first criminal was sentenced when the Romans pronounced **judgment** on him. Alternate translation: “you are being executed on a cross just as he is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:41	qyp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & ἐπράξαμεν & ἀπολαμβάνομεν	1	The second criminal, speaking to the first criminal, is using the term **we** to mean himself and the first criminal. So **we** would be inclusive in all these cases, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
23:41	m656		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	ἡμεῖς & ἐπράξαμεν & ἀπολαμβάνομεν	1	Since the term **we** refers to two people here, it would be in the dual form if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
23:41	i4gm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἡμεῖς & δικαίως	1	The second criminal is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “we are receiving this punishment justly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
23:41	m657		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄξια & ὧν ἐπράξαμεν	1	The second criminal is using the adjective **worthy** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “a just punishment for what we did” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:41	nu35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οὗτος	1	The second criminal is using the adjective **this** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person, Jesus. ULT supplies the noun **one** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “this man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:42	mht9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ ἔλεγεν	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the second criminal, who continues speaking, now to Jesus. Alternate translation: “The second criminal then said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:42	j9d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μνήσθητί μου	1	As in [1:72](../01/72.md), the word **remember** here figuratively describes Jesus thinking about this second criminal and considering what action he can take on his behalf. It does not suggest that Jesus would forget about him. Alternate translation: “do what you could to help me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:42	m658		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μνήσθητί μου	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as a polite request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please do what you can to help me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
23:42	zyv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὅταν ἔλθῃς ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ σου	1	To **come into** a **kingdom** means to begin to rule as king, as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “when you begin to rule as king” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:43	abcv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἶπεν αὐτῷ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, and the pronoun **him** refers to the second criminal. Alternate translation: “Jesus said to this criminal” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
23:43	n6w9			ἀμήν, σοι λέγω	1	Jesus says this to emphasize what he is about to tell the criminal. Alternate translation: “I can assure you”
23:43	m659			σήμερον μετ’ ἐμοῦ ἔσῃ ἐν τῷ Παραδείσῳ	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of how the term **today** belongs with this promise that Jesus is making to the criminal, and not with the introduction to the statement. Alternate translation: “you will be with me in paradise today”
23:43	f1fl			τῷ Παραδείσῳ	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter of the term **paradise**. Alternate translation: “in the place where people whom God has accepted go when they die”
23:44	m660		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	καὶ ἦν ἤδη	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. He explains that it was about noon so that readers will appreciate how extraordinary it was that the entire sky became dark. Alternate translation: “Now by this time it was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
23:44	x7fl			ὡσεὶ ὥρα ἕκτη	1	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “about noon”
23:44	m661		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ὡσεὶ ὥρα ἕκτη	1	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “around hour six” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
23:44	q4t3			σκότος ἐγένετο ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν γῆν	1	The term translated as **land** could refer to: (1) a particular area. Alternate translation, as in UST: “it became dark throughout that whole area” (2) the earth. Alternate translation: “darkness covered the entire earth”
23:44	m662		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σκότος ἐγένετο ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν γῆν	1	This could also be a figurative reference to the sky, since it is **over** the **land**. Alternate translation: “the entire sky became dark” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:44	e8zn			ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης	1	This phrase also expresses the way people in this culture began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “until three o’clock in the afternoon”
23:44	m663		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	ἕως ὥρας ἐνάτης	1	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “until hour nine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
23:45	hjt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλειπόντος	1	This means figuratively that **the sun**, as if it were an active agent, **failed** to give its light. Luke is speaking from an observational perspective. The sun was still shining above the darkness, but its light could not be seen through the darkness. Alternate translation: “It was too dark even to see the light of the sun” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
23:45	m664		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐσχίσθη δὲ τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ μέσον	1	See the General Notes to this chapter for an explanation of the symbolic significance of this action. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
23:45	ssh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to the curtain that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the temple. Alternate translation: “the curtain in front of the Most Holy Place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:45	ah4k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐσχίσθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God tore” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:45	m665		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μέσον	1	The implication, as the General Notes to this chapter explain, is that God tearing **the curtain** opened the way into the Most Holy Place. And so **in the middle** means not “across the middle,” from side to side, but “down through the middle,” from top to bottom. Alternate translation: “into two pieces, from top to bottom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:46	z1fq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	φωνήσας φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1	This is an idiom that means Jesus raised the volume of his **voice**. Alternate translation: “crying out loudly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:46	r4ub		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πάτερ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God my Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
23:46	mix5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	εἰς χεῖράς σου παρατίθεμαι τὸ Πνεῦμά μου	1	Jesus is using God’s **hands** figuratively to represent God’s care. Alternate translation: “I give my spirit to you, knowing you will care for it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
23:46	m666			τὸ Πνεῦμά μου	1	The **spirit** of a person lives on after they die. So you could also translate this as a reference to Jesus’ life after death. Alternate translation: “my life”
23:46	bd6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ἐξέπνευσεν	1	Luke is describing the death of Jesus in a discreet way. Alternate translation: “he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
23:47	p6lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἑκατοντάρχης	1	The implication is that this was the Roman officer who was in charge of the other Roman soldiers who crucified Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Roman officer in charge of the crucifixion” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:47	m667		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ γενόμενον	1	This expression is singular and so it refers to the immediately preceding event, the death of Jesus. (The expression is plural in the next verse, where it refers to all of the events of the crucifixiion.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “how Jesus had entrusted his spirit to God when he died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:47	m668			ἐδόξαζεν τὸν Θεὸν λέγων	1	This means that the centurion **glorified God** by what he said. Alternate translation: “brought honor to God by saying”
23:47	c2ti			ὁ ἄνθρωπος οὗτος δίκαιος ἦν	1	Alternate translation: “this man had not done anything wrong”
23:48	gt8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνπαραγενόμενοι & ἐπὶ τὴν θεωρίαν ταύτην	1	The term **spectacle** describes something that people would look at. It refers here to the crucifixion of Jesus and the two criminals. Alternate translation: “who had gathered to watch the crucifixions” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:48	whs7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπέστρεφον	1	The implication is that the people in the crowds **returned** to their homes. Alternate translation: “returned to their homes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:48	ft9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	τύπτοντες τὰ στήθη	1	As in [18:13](../18/13.md), this was a physical expression of great sorrow. Alternate translation: “hitting their chests to express their great sorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
23:49	m669		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντες οἱ γνωστοὶ αὐτῷ	1	Luke is using the adjective **acquainted** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “all the people who knew Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
23:49	m670		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες οἱ γνωστοὶ αὐτῷ	1	These means implicitly all the people in the crowd that had come to watch the crucifixion who knew Jesus. It does not mean the disciples, since they had fled and were hiding. Rather, it means other people in Jerusalem who knew Jesus personally, which could include people such as the ones who lent him the colt in [19:30-33](../19/30.md) and the one who provided the room for the Passover meal in [22:11-13](../22/11.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all the people in the crowd who knew Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:49	xzh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γυναῖκες αἱ συνακολουθοῦσαι αὐτῷ ἀπὸ τῆς Γαλιλαίας	1	Here, **followed** does not have the figurative meaning of “became a disciple.” Rather, the implication is that the women whom Luke describes in [8:2-3](../08/02.md), who accompanied Jesus and his disciples and provided for them out of their own means, had traveled with the group here to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the women who helped Jesus and his disciples, who had traveled with him from Galilee” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:49	s74u			ταῦτα	1	Alternate translation: “what happened”
23:50	cbj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to call the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:50	ud7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἀνὴρ ὀνόματι Ἰωσὴφ, βουλευτὴς ὑπάρχων, ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you could use it here in your translation. It may be helpful to make this more than one sentence. Alternate translation: “there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the Sanhedrin. He was a good and righteous man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
23:50	m671		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ	1	**Joseph** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:50	wx2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βουλευτὴς	1	The term **council** refers implicitly to the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council whose name Luke provides in [22:66](../22/66.md). You could use that name here. If so, see how you translated this phrase there. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:50	m672		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἀνὴρ ἀγαθὸς καὶ δίκαιος	1	The terms **good** and **righteous** mean similar things. Luke may be using repetition for emphasis. Alternate translation: “a very upright man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
23:51	m673		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	(οὗτος οὐκ ἦν συνκατατεθειμένος τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῇ πράξει αὐτῶν)	1	Luke provides this background information about Joseph to help readers understand what happens in the next verse, when Joseph asks Pilate for permission to bury Jesus’ body. It may be helpful to make this a continuation of the last sentence in the previous verse, since it also shows that Joseph was a “good and righteous man,” as that sentence says. Alternate translation: “who had not agreed with the action of the council” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
23:51	m674		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῇ πράξει αὐτῶν	1	Luke is using a figure of speech in which two nouns are connected with the word **and**, and one of the nouns describes the other. Alternate translation: “the action of the council” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
23:51	ddr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ βουλῇ καὶ τῇ πράξει αὐτῶν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “the decision of the Sanhedrin to condemn Jesus for blasphemy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:51	rba6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας, πόλεως τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	Since Joseph was a member of the Sanhedrin, he had likely come to live in Jerusalem, so Luke would mean that he was originally **from Arimathea**. Joseph had not come from Arimathea to Jerusalem for this occasion. Alternate translation: “who was originally from Arimathea, a city in Judea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:51	m675		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἁριμαθαίας	1	**Arimathea** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
23:51	m676		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὃς προσεδέχετο τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	As in [2:25](../02/25.md) and [2:38](../02/38.md), the term **waiting** does not mean passively **waiting** for something to happen, but eagerly anticipating something that someone wants to happen. See how you translated the term in those places. Alternate translation: “who was eagerly anticipating the coming of the kingdom of God” or “who was looking forward to the coming of the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:52	tk6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος	1	**This one** implicitly means Joseph. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that it was Joseph who went to Pilate by using his name, as UST does, or by saying “this man.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:52	m677		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος, προσελθὼν τῷ Πειλάτῳ, ᾐτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	The implication is that Joseph requested the body of Jesus so that he could give it a proper burial. Ordinarily, to make crucifixion as gruesome a death as possible, the Romans left the dead bodies of people who had been crucified on the crosses to be eaten by wild animals, and they then burned whatever remained in the Valley of Hinnom where, as a note to [12:5](../12/05.md) explains, refuse was thrown and fires burned continually. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain why Joseph asked for Jesus’ body. You could also specify that Pilate gave Joseph permission to bury Jesus, as UST does. Alternate translation: “This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus so that he could bury it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:53	ec9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Luke uses the word **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. When Pilate gave Joseph permission to take Jesus’ body down from the cross and bury it, Joseph did so. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
23:53	f5bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐνετύλιξεν αὐτὸ σινδόνι	1	This was the burial custom in this culture. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could describe it more specifically, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “and he wrapped it in a fine linen burial cloth” or “and he prepared it for burial” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:53	pxhf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σινδόνι	1	The term **linen cloth** refers to a high quality clothe made from the fibers of the flax plant. If you do not have **linen** in your region and/or your readers would be unfamiliar with this term, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a fine cloth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:53	yy3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μνήματι λαξευτῷ	1	This means specifically a burial place that had been cut or chiseled out of rock, most likely into the face of a cliff, as UST suggests. You could express that more specifically, or you could use a general expression if there are no rock cliffs in your area and readers might not understand the meaning. Alternate translation: “a tomb that had been chiseled out of rock” or “a special burial place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:53	m5wu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὗ οὐκ ἦν οὐδεὶς οὔπω κείμενος	1	Here Luke uses a triple negative in Greek for emphasis, “where no one not yet had not lain.” This stresses the honor that Joseph was showing Jesus by putting his body in a tomb that was being used for the very first time. If your language uses multiple negatives for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You might express the emphasis in other ways, and it may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No body had ever before been put in that tomb” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
23:54	m678		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ	1	Luke uses **and** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
23:54	tia9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡμέρα ἦν παρασκευῆς	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what this **day** was used in **preparation** for. Alternate translation: “the day when people made preparations for the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest, since they could not do any work then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:54	b4i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Σάββατον ἐπέφωσκεν	1	For the Jews, the day began at sunset. But Luke speaks figuratively of this day **dawning** to mean that it was about to begin, even though this would happen at sunset rather than at sunrise. Alternate translation: “it was nearly sunset, when the Sabbath would begin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
23:55	pu3i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αἵτινες ἦσαν συνεληλυθυῖαι ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας αὐτῷ	1	The expression **had come out** is an idiom that means to have traveled from a place. Alternate translation: “who had traveled from the region of Galilee with Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
23:55	m679		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	κατακολουθήσασαι	1	Luke is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “followed Joseph when he took the body of Jesus away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
23:55	m680		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τὸ μνημεῖον καὶ ὡς ἐτέθη τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ	1	Luke is using a figure of speech in which two phrases are connected with the word **and**, and one of the phrases describes the other. Alternate translation: “the tomb where Joseph laid the body of Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
23:55	nhd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὡς ἐτέθη τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “how Joseph laid the body of Jesus there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
23:56	sm68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑποστρέψασαι	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state where the women returned. Alternate translation: “returning to the place where they were staying in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:56	mj6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡτοίμασαν ἀρώματα καὶ μύρα	1	In keeping with the burial customs of the time, the women prepared these **spices and ointments** to put on Jesus’ body, to honor him and to counteract the smell of decay. Alternate translation: “they prepared spices and ointments to put on Jesus’ body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
23:56	m681		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀρώματα καὶ μύρα	1	The **spices** were sweet-smelling substances that were dry, and the **ointments** were sweet-smelling substances that were moist. If your readers would not be familiar with **spices and ointments**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “sweet-smelling substances” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
23:56	uzk9			ἡσύχασαν	1	Alternate translation: “the women did not do any work”
23:56	tk6s			κατὰ τὴν ἐντολήν	1	Alternate translation: “as Moses had commanded in the law”
24:intro	r5qx				0	# Luke 24 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. The women go to Jesus’ tomb and find it empty (24:1-12)\n2. Two disciples meet Jesus on a journey to Emmaus (24:13-35)\n3. Jesus, risen from the dead, appears to his disciples (24:36-53)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The loyalty of the women\n\nMany of Luke’s original readers would have thought that women were less important than men. But Luke carefully demonstrates that some women who loved Jesus very much showed him greater loyalty than the twelve disciples did. While the disciples ran away and hid, the women lovingly cared for Jesus’ body, and as a result, they were the first to learn that he had risen from the dead.\n\n### Resurrection\n\nLuke wants his readers to understand that Jesus came alive again in a physical body ([Luke 24:38-43](../24/38.md)).\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “the third day”\n\nThis expression occurs three times in this chapter, in [24:7](../24/07.md), [24:21](../24/21.md), and [24:46](../24/46.md). See the explanation of this expression in the note to Luke [18:33](../18/33.md). In the idiom of this culture, today was the “first day,” tomorrow was the “second day,” and the day after tomorrow was the “third day.” By that way of reckoning time, since Jesus died on a Friday, when he rose from the dead on a Sunday, that was the “third day.”\n\n### Two men in bright shining robes\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all write about angels in white clothing speaking with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Matthew and John call them angels, while Mark and Luke call them men, but that is only because the angels appeared in human form. Luke and John write about both angels, while Matthew and Mark write about only one of them. It would be best to translate each of these passages as it appears in ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
24:1	m682		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ & μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	This implicitly means the **first** day of the week. Alternate translation: “on the first day of the week” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:1	r62f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τῇ & μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	Here Luke is actually using a cardinal number, “one,” to mean **first**. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can also use a cardinal number here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on day one of the week” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
24:1	m683		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὄρθρου βαθέως	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “at the first light of dawn” or “as dawn was just beginning to break” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
24:1	qg7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπὶ τὸ μνῆμα ἦλθαν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the women whom Luke describes in [23:55-56](../23/55.md). Alternate translation: “these women returned to the tomb” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
24:2	jq9p			εὗρον & τὸν λίθον ἀποκεκυλισμένον	1	Alternate translation: “they saw that the stone had been rolled away”
24:2	l6uk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν λίθον ἀποκεκυλισμένον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that someone had rolled away the stone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
24:2	t4mf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν λίθον	1	Luke assumes that his readers will know that this was a large, cut, round stone that was big enough to completely block the entrance to the tomb. It had been put in place to seal off the entrance, and it would have required several people to move it. Alternate translation: “the large stone that had been put in place at the entrance to the tomb” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:3	m684			εἰσελθοῦσαι	1	Alternate translation: “once they entered the tomb”
24:3	elq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐχ εὗρον τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	You can state explicitly that they did not find the body because it was not there. Alternate translation: “they discovered that the body of the Lord Jesus was not there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:4	bmt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
24:4	m685		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	2	Luke uses this word to indicate that this event, the appearance of the two men, came after the events he has just described, the women discovering that the tomb was empty and wondering about that. Alternate translation: “then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
24:4	m686		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the term **behold** to calls the reader’s attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
24:5	c11i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐμφόβων & γενομένων αὐτῶν & εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτάς	1	The first instance of **they** refers to the women, while the second instance refers to the men. Alternate translation: “as the women became terrified … the men said to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
24:5	n5xf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	κλινουσῶν τὰ πρόσωπα εἰς τὴν γῆν	1	Looking down at **the ground** was a gesture of respect towards these men. Alternate translation: “respectfully lowered their gaze” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
24:5	abcw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτάς	1	If your language uses dual forms for verbs, use that form here, since two men are speaking. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
24:5	fs3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ζητεῖτε τὸν ζῶντα μετὰ τῶν νεκρῶν?	1	The men do not expect the women to tell them why they are looking for a living person in a tomb. Rather, the men are using the question form to make an announcement. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be looking for Jesus here, because he is no longer dead, he is alive again!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
24:5	m687		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τὸν ζῶντα μετὰ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	The men are using the adjectives **living** and **dead** as nouns to refer to groups of people. (The term **living** is actually a participle that functions here as an adjective.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “someone who is alive among the bodies of people who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
24:6	m688		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἠγέρθη	1	The term **raised** is an idiom that means “brought back to life.” Alternate translation: “has been brought back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
24:6	awf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who has done the action. Alternate translation: “God has made him alive again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
24:6	s8k5			μνήσθητε ὡς ἐλάλησεν ὑμῖν	1	Alternate translation: “Remember that he said to you”
24:6	m689		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	The word **you** is plural. It refers to the women, and possibly also to Jesus’ disciples. If your language has a form of **you** that includes both the addressees and a larger group besides, it would be appropriate to use it here. Alternate translation: “all of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
24:6	m690			ὑμῖν, ἔτι ὢν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ	1	Alternate translation: “to you when he was still in Galilee”
24:7	sj3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	λέγων & ὅτι	1	These words introduce an indirect quotation. You could also translate what follows as a direct quotation, as UST does. However, that would be a quotation within a quotation, and you may wish to avoid that by leaving what follows as an indirect quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
24:7	pl6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου & παραδοθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for someone to betray the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
24:7	m691		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	When Jesus said this, he was referring to himself in the third person. If you decide to represent this as a direct quotation, and If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “me, the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
24:7	m692		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated this title in [5:24](../05/24.md). Alternate translation: “him, the Messiah” or, if you are translating as a direct quotation in the first person, “me, the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:7	e4ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	As in [9:44](../09/44.md), **hands** here figuratively represent power and control. Alternate translation: “and give sinful men power over him” or, if you are translating as a direct quotation in the first person, “and give sinful men power over me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
24:7	m693		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ σταυρωθῆναι	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “and for those sinful men to crucify him” or, if you are translating as a direct quotation in the first person, “and for those sinful men to crucify me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
24:7	m694		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἀναστῆναι	1	See how you translated this phrase in [9:22](../09/22.md). Alternate translation: “and after spending the next full day in the grave, to come back to life on the day after that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:7	dta4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “on day three” or, depending on how your culture reckons time, “on day two” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
24:7	m695		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀναστῆναι	1	Jesus spoke figuratively of coming back to life in this way, since it involved coming **up** out of the grave. Alternate translation: “to come back to life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
24:8	rew5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐμνήσθησαν τῶν ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to describe the statement that Jesus made using words. Alternate translation: “the women remembered what Jesus had said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
24:9	iz68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἕνδεκα	1	This expression is equivalent to “the Twelve,” which occurs in [8:1](../08/01.md) and several other places in the book. See how you translated this term there. Luke now says **the Eleven** because Judas Iscariot was no longer part of the group. You may have decided to translate the nominal adjective “Twelve” with an equivalent phrase. If so, you could do the same thing here. Alternate translation: “the 11 men who remained of those whom Jesus had appointed to be apostles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
24:9	m696		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τοῖς ἕνδεκα	1	Alternatively, you may have decided in [8:1](../08/01.md) to translate “the Twelve” as a title, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns. If so, you can do the same thing with **the Eleven** here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
24:9	fnh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς λοιποῖς	1	Implicitly this means all the other disciples of Jesus who were together with the 11 apostles at that time. Alternate translation: “and to all the rest of the disciples who were with them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:10	h1ml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δὲ	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce some background information, specifically, the names of some of the women who came from the tomb and told the apostles what had happened there. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
24:10	m697		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαγδαληνὴ Μαρία	1	**Mary** is the name of a woman, and **Magdalene** is a distinguishing term that most likely means that she came from the town of Magdala. See how you translated her name in [8:2](../08/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
24:10	m698		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰωάννα	1	**Joanna** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
24:10	m699		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου	1	**Mary** is the name of a woman, and **James** is the name of her son. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
24:11	m700		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce a contrast between the exciting good news that the women were sharing and the disbelieving reaction of the people they shared it with. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
24:11	apl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα	1	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to describe the report that the women gave using words. Alternate translation: “what the women were saying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
24:11	m701		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν	1	Luke uses this expression, which means “in front them,” to mean “where they could see.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “in their opinion” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
24:11	m702		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	2	This phrase describes the result of the fact that the report seemed like nonsense to the apostles and other believers. Alternate translation: “so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
24:11	m703		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἠπίστουν αὐταῖς	1	The word **they** refers to the apostles and other believers, and the word **them** refers to the women. Alternate translation: “so the apostles and other believers did not believe the women” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
24:12	rm1d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς	1	This expression is an idiom that means to take initiative. It does not necessarily mean that Peter had been sitting or lying down and then stood up. Alternate translation: “taking initiative” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
24:12	ax6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	παρακύψας	1	Peter had to bend over in order to see inside the tomb because tombs cut in solid rock were very low. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “bending at the waist in order to look into the low tomb” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:12	m704			βλέπει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Luke uses the present tense in past narration. See how you decided to approach this usage in [7:40](../07/40.md). If it would not be natural to use the present tense in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “he saw”
24:12	n1tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ὀθόνια μόνα	1	The phrase **the linen cloths** refers to the cloths that Joseph of Arimathea used to wrap Jesus’ body when he was buried, as described in [23:53](../23/53.md). The implication is that the body of Jesus was no longer in the tomb. Alternate translation: “the linen cloths in which Jesus’ body had been wrapped, but the body was not there” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:12	d6i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὰ ὀθόνια	1	The term **linen cloths** refers to a high quality clothe made from the fibers of the flax plant. If you do not have **linen** in your region and/or your readers would be unfamiliar with this term, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the fine cloths” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
24:12	m705			ἀπῆλθεν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν, θαυμάζων τὸ γεγονός	1	This phrase can be understood in two different ways, depending on how the words in it are grouped together. Different versions of the Bible interpret this differently. If there is already a version of the Bible in your area, see how it translates this. You may wish to translate it in the same way. Otherwise, we recommend that you follow the reading of ULT. (1) If the grouping is “he went away, to himself wondering,” then the meaning is as in ULT and UST. (2) If the grouping is “he went away to himself, wondering,” then the meaning is that Peter went back to his own home. Alternate translation: “he went away to his home, wondering what had happened”
24:13	emc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἰδοὺ	1	Luke uses the word **behold** to introduce a new event in the story. If your language has a similar expression that it uses for this same purpose, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
24:13	m706		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, ἦσαν πορευόμενοι εἰς κώμην ἀπέχουσαν	1	Luke provides this background information to help readers understand what happens next.

24:13	e8gx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	The word **them** refers to Jesus’ disciples, but not specifically to the apostles, since at the end of this episode, these two men return to Jerusalem and report to the apostles. Alternate translation: “two of Jesus’ disciples” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
24:13	s5n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	Alternate translation: “on the same day when the women found that the tomb was empty” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:13	m707			σταδίους ἑξήκοντα ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλήμ, ᾗ ὄνομα Ἐμμαοῦς	1	It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The name of the village was Emmaus, and it was 60 stadia from Jerusalem”
24:13	d8jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἐμμαοῦς	1	**Emmaus** is the name of a village. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “about eleven kilometers” or “about seven miles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
24:14	m708		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντων τῶν συμβεβηκότων τούτων	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what **these things** means. Alternate translation: “how Jesus had been arrested and crucified, and how the women had said his body was no longer in the tomb” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:15	m709		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
24:15	b3sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸς Ἰησοῦς	1	The word **himself** emphasizes the fact that it was truly Jesus who joined them as they walked. This was not a vision in which Jesus only appeared to be there. Alternate translation: “Jesus, risen from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
24:15	m710			ἐγγίσας, συνεπορεύετο αὐτοῖς	1	Alternate translation: “caught up with them and walked along with them”
24:16	q6nk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν ἐκρατοῦντο τοῦ μὴ ἐπιγνῶναι αὐτόν	1	Luke uses one part of the men, their **eyes**, to speak figuratively of the capacity of the men themselves to recognize Jesus. Alternate translation: “But God prevented them from recognizing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
24:16	m711		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν ἐκρατοῦντο τοῦ μὴ ἐπιγνῶναι αὐτόν	1	Luke uses the term **held** figuratively, as if someone were physically holding back the eyes, to mean “restrained.” Alternate translation: “But God prevented them from recognizing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
24:16	m712		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν ἐκρατοῦντο τοῦ μὴ ἐπιγνῶναι αὐτόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you could state who was doing the action. Alternate translation: “But God prevented them from recognizing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
24:17	xak8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	αὐτούς & ἀντιβάλλετε & περιπατοῦντες & ἐστάθησαν	1	Since Jesus is speaking to two men, all of these expressions would be in the dual form, if your language uses that form. (Your language might even put the adjective **gloomy**, which is plural in Greek, in the dual, since it describes the two men.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
24:17	m713		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ λόγοι οὗτοι οὓς ἀντιβάλλετε πρὸς ἀλλήλους	1	Jesus is using the term **words** figuratively to describe what the men had been saying using words. Alternate translation: “these things that you have been saying to one another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
24:17	m714			ἐστάθησαν, σκυθρωποί	1	Alternate translation: “they stopped walking and looked sad”

Rather, Cleopas is using the question form to show his surprise, since he expects that everyone would know about these events. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You must be the only person visiting Jerusalem who does not know what has just happened in the city!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
24:18	m717		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Conventionally, Greek referred to cities with feminine pronouns. Your language may use a different gender. You could also use a noun. Alternate translation: “in it” or “in that city” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
24:18	m718		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Cleopas is using the term **days** figuratively to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at this time” or “recently” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
24:19	aj5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποῖα	1	This implicitly means, “**What kind** of things?” But by asking about the quality of the events, rather than just the fact of the events (“What things?”), Jesus is acknowledging that they must have been very special. Alternate translation: “What kind of things?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:19	m719		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	οἱ & εἶπαν	1	Since two men are speaking, this would be in the dual form, if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
24:19	m720		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ναζαρηνοῦ	1	The term **Nazarene** is a name that refers to a person who is from the city of Nazareth.

24:19	m721		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀνὴρ, προφήτης	1	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about a person in an honorable way. Alternate translation: “a distinguished prophet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
24:19	m722		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	δυνατὸς ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ λόγῳ	1	The two men are using the term **work** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus did, and the term **word** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus said. Alternate translation: “who did great miracles and taught profound things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
24:19	x25r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐναντίον τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ	1	This expression means “while God and all the people were watching.” In the case of **God**, it means figuratively that God gave Jesus the power to do miracles and to teach profound things. In the case of **the people**, it means that the miracles and teachings of Jesus amazed the people when they saw and heard them. Alternate translation: “as God empowered him, to the amazement of all the people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
24:19	m723		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ	1	This is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “great crowds of people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
24:20	m724		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	This is a reference to the Jewish leaders, and the two men likely recognize Jesus as a fellow Jew, so the word **our** would be inclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
24:20	e5zt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	παρέδωκαν αὐτὸν & εἰς κρίμα θανάτου	1	The men are using the **judgment of death**, that is, the death sentence that the Romans passed on Jesus, figuratively to represent the Romans themselves.

24:20	m725		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	καὶ ἐσταύρωσαν αὐτόν	1	The men speak as if their **chief priests** and **rulers** crucified Jesus themselves. They are speaking figuratively, describing all of the people who were responsible for the crucifixion of Jesus, including the crowds, Pilate, and the Roman soldiers by reference to the Jewish leaders, who set the process in motion by stirring up the crowds and persuading Pilate. Alternate translation: “so that he was crucified” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
24:21	ei9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & ἠλπίζομεν	1	The men are speaking of themselves and likely their fellow disciples as well, but not of Jesus, so **we** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
24:21	ljb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ μέλλων λυτροῦσθαι τὸν Ἰσραήλ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:38](../02/38.md). The word **redeem** means literally to “buy back,” for example, to buy someone’s freedom from slavery, but the men are using it in a figurative sense here. Alternate translation: “the person who was going to bring God’s blessings and favor back to the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

24:21	sg3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τρίτην ταύτην ἡμέραν ἄγει, ἀφ’ οὗ ταῦτα ἐγένετο	1	By saying **he is spending this third day**, the men are referring to Jesus as if he were alive. However, they are actually saying how long he has been dead. They are going to tell how the women reported that his grave was empty, and they find it unbelievable that anyone who had been dead that long would have gotten up out of the grave. See how you translated the expression **the third day** in 9:22, and express this in the way that your culture reckons time. Alternate translation: “the Romans put him to death on the day before yesterday” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:21	xqc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τρίτην ταύτην ἡμέραν ἄγει, ἀφ’ οὗ ταῦτα ἐγένετο	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here.

24:22	a3j9			γυναῖκές τινες ἐξ ἡμῶν	1	Alternate translation: “some women in our group”
24:22	m727		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμᾶς	1	The men are speaking of themselves and their fellow disciples, but not of Jesus, so **us** would be exclusive in both instances here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
24:22	du1v			γενόμεναι ὀρθριναὶ ἐπὶ τὸ μνημεῖον	1	The men are using this expression to refer to the **women**, not to themselves. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here and continue it into the next verse. Alternate translation: “They went to his tomb early this morning”
24:23	m728			καὶ μὴ εὑροῦσαι τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ, ἦλθαν	1	If you began a new sentence at the end of the previous verse, you could continue it here. Alternate translation: “but they did not find his body, so they came to us”
24:24	m729			τινες τῶν σὺν ἡμῖν	1	Alternate translation: “some of the men in our group”
24:24	m730		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	The men are speaking of themselves and their fellow disciples, but not of Jesus, so **us** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
24:24	m731		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὗρον οὕτως, καθὼς καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες εἶπον	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the implications of this statement explicitly.

24:25	m732		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀνόητοι	1	Jesus is using the adjective **foolish** as a noun. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate the term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “you foolish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
24:25	m733		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	ἀνόητοι	1	Jesus is speaking to two men, so the word “you” would be in the dual form if your language marks that form, if you choose to use that word in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
24:25	vg3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ βραδεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ, τοῦ πιστεύειν	1	The term **heart** figuratively represents the mind. Alternate translation: “who have such difficulty believing with your minds” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
24:25	m734		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	καὶ βραδεῖς τῇ καρδίᾳ, τοῦ πιστεύειν	1	The word **slow** figuratively represents difficulty, since someone who has difficulty doing something will do it slowly.

24:25	m735		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσιν οἷς ἐλάλησαν οἱ προφῆται	1	The term **all** is a generalization that refers specifically to what the prophets said about the Messiah. Alternate translation: “what the prophets said about the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
24:26	n85k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ταῦτα ἔδει παθεῖν τὸν Χριστὸν καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ?	1	Jesus is using the question form to remind the disciples about what the prophets said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “The Messiah had to suffer these things in order to enter into his glory!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
24:26	m736		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	This is not a second thing that it was necessary for the Messiah to do. Rather, this is the result for which it was necessary for the Messiah to do the first thing. Alternate translation: “in order to enter into his glory” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
24:26	f8es		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “to receive a glorious position” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
24:27	g4t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Μωϋσέως & τῶν προφητῶν	1	Luke is using the name **Moses** figuratively to refer to the part of Scripture that Moses wrote, and the term **the prophets** to refer to the part of Scripture that they wrote.

24:27	m737			καὶ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	The term **beginning** applies just to the writings of Moses. Jesus began with that part of Scripture, and he then continued teaching from the writings of the prophets. Alternate translation: “and then from all the writings of the prophets” or “and continuing with all the writings of the prophets”
24:28	m738		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	ἤγγισαν εἰς τὴν κώμην οὗ ἐπορεύοντο	1	The first **they** refers to Jesus and the two disciples, while the second **they** refers only to the two disciples, so **they were going** would be in the dual form, if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
24:28	cdj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτὸς προσεποιήσατο πορρώτερον πορεύεσθαι	1	This means that the two disciples understood from Jesus’ actions that he was continuing on to another destination. Perhaps he kept walking on the road when they turned off to enter Emmaus. There is no indication that Jesus deceived them with words. Alternate translation: “Jesus seemed to be heading farther down the road” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:29	m739		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1	Luke uses this word to introduce a contrast between what it appeared Jesus was going to do and what the two disciples wanted him to do.

24:29	m740		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs	παρεβιάσαντο & ἡμῶν & αὐτοῖς	1	This verb, as well as these two pronouns, would be in the dual form, if your language marks that form, since they apply to the two disciples. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
24:29	pn4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	παρεβιάσαντο αὐτὸν	1	Luke is telling this story in a concise way, and he does not say what the two disciples urged Jesus to do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply that information from the context. Alternate translation: “they urged him to stay overnight in the house with them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
24:29	m741		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	The men are speaking of themselves but not of Jesus, so **us** would be exclusive here, if your language marks that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
24:29	s6ps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἐστὶν, καὶ κέκλικεν ἤδη ἡ ἡμέρα	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. The two disciples are likely using repetition for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the phrases in your translation. Alternate translation: “it is already getting dark” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
24:29	m742		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς ἑσπέραν ἐστὶν, καὶ κέκλικεν ἤδη ἡ ἡμέρα	1	The implications are that the disciples are saying this out of concern for Jesus’ safety. Alternate translation: “it is already getting dark, and soon it will not be safe to travel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
24:29	m743		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	κέκλικεν ἤδη ἡ ἡμέρα	1	The disciples are referring figuratively to the sun as **the day**, since day is when the sun shines. Alternate translation: “the sun is going down” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
24:29	tgi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3	Luke uses this word to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Because the two disciples urged Jesus to stay with them, he agreed. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
24:30	k6ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ ἐγένετο	1	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this episode. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
