Jesus rises from the dead (20:1–29)\n1. John says why he wrote his Gospel (20:30–31)\n1. Jesus meets with the disciples (21)\n\nMore detailed outlines are in the General Notes for each chapter.\n\n### What is the Gospel of John about?\n\nThe Gospel of John is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. John said that he wrote his Gospel “so that people might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God” ([20:31](../20/31.md)). John’s Gospel repeatedly emphasizes that Jesus is God in human form.\n\nJohn’s Gospel is very different from the other three Gospels. John does not include some of the teachings and events that the other writers included in their Gospels. Also, John wrote about some teachings and events that are not in the other Gospels.\n\nJohn wrote much about the miraculous signs Jesus did to prove that what Jesus said about himself was true. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of John” or “The Gospel According to John.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News About Jesus That John Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the Gospel of John?\n\nThis book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the apostle John was the author. Further evidence that the apostle John wrote this Gospel is the fact that his name does not occur once within the book. Instead, this Gospel contains the phrases “the disciple whom Jesus loved” or “the other disciple” in places where the other Gospels indicate that John was present ([13:23–25](../13/23.md); [19:26–27](../19/26.md); [20:2–8](../20/02.md); [21:7](../21/07.md), [20–24](../21/20.md)). The apostle John most likely referred to himself in this manner because he wanted to humbly say that he had a very close relationship with Jesus. He was part of Jesus’ inner circle of disciples who became the “pillars” of the early church ([Galatians 2:9](../../gal/02/09.md)).\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why does John write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?\n\nJohn wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This is a reference to [Daniel 7:13–14](../../dan/07/13.md). In that passage, there is a person who is described as like a “son of man.” That means that the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to this “son of man” to rule over the nations forever. All people will worship him forever.\n\nJews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. But Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### What does the word “sign” mean in the Gospel of John?\n\nWhile other New Testament writers use terms like “mighty works” or “wonders” to refer to the miracles that Jesus did, John prefers to use the term “sign.” The miracles John calls “signs” were significant displays of divine power. John called them signs to emphasize that an important purpose of Jesus’ miracles was to prove that Jesus was God and that what Jesus said about himself was true. John said that in his Gospel he only wrote about some of the signs that Jesus did. John said, “these have been written so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that believing, you would have life in his name” ([20:30–31](../20/30.md)).\n\n### What do the words “remain,” “reside,” and “abide” mean in the Gospel of John?\n\nJohn often used the words “remain,” “reside,” and “abide” as metaphors. John spoke of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if Jesus’ word “remained” in the believer. John also spoke of someone being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person “remained” in the other person. Christians are said to “remain” in Christ and in God. The Father is said to “remain” in the Son, and the Son is said to “remain” in the Father. The Son is said to “remain” in believers. The Holy Spirit is also said to “remain” in the believers.\n\nMany translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. For example, Jesus intended to express the idea of the Christian being spiritually together with him when he said, “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him” ([6:56](../06/56.md)). The UST uses the idea of “will be united with me, and I will be united with them,” but translators may have to find other ways of expressing the idea.\n\nIn the passage, “my words remain in you” ([15:7](../15/07.md)), the UST expresses this idea as “obey what I have taught you.” Translators may find it possible to use this translation as a model.\n\n### What is double meaning in the Gospel of John?\n\nJohn occasionally used words or phrases that could have two meanings (double entendre) in the language in which he originally wrote this Gospel. For example, the phrase translated “born again” in the ULT could also mean “born from above” ([3:3](../03/03.md), [7](../03/07.md)). In such cases, you may want to choose one meaning and put the other meaning in a footnote.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Gospel of John?\n\nThe following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to translate these verses. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in the translators’ region that include these verses, then the translators can include them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that they were probably not originally in John’s Gospel.\n\n* “waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel of the Lord went down into the pool and stirred up the water at certain times, and whoever then first stepped in after the water was stirred was healed from whatever disease he suffered from.” (5:3-4)\n* “going through the midst of them, and so passed by” ([8:59](../08/59.md))\n\nThe following passage is included in most older and modern versions of the Bible. But it is not in the earliest copies of the Bible. Translators are advised to translate this passage. It should be put inside of square brackets (\\[\\]) to indicate that it may not have been original to John’s Gospel.\n\n* The story of the adulterous woman ([7:53](../07/53.md)–[8:11](../08/11.md)) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	k29b				0	# John 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus is God (1:1–5)\n2. John the Baptist was Jesus’ witness (1:6–8)\n3. Summary of Jesus’ ministry on earth (1:9–13)\n4. Jesus is God in the flesh (1:14–18)\n5. John the Baptist prepares the way for Jesus (1:19–34)\n6. Jesus meets Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathaniel (1:35–51)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:23](../01/23.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “The Word”\n\nJohn uses the phrase “the Word” to refer to Jesus ([1:1](../01/01.md), [14](../01/14.md)). John is saying that God’s most important message to all people is actually Jesus, a person with a physical body. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wordofgod]])\n\n### Light and Darkness\n\nIn [1:4–9](../01/04.md), John uses an extended metaphor in which light represents what is true and good and darkness represents what is false and evil. John applies that light metaphor to Jesus in order to show that Jesus is God’s truth and goodness displayed in a human body. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### “Children of God”\n\nPeople are sometimes described as “children of God” because God created them. However, John uses this expression in a different sense in this chapter. He uses it to describe people who have entered into a father-child relationship with God by putting their faith and trust in Jesus. God indeed created all people, but people can only become children of God in this sense by believing in Jesus. “Children” in this usage does not refer to those who are young, but only to the relationship that people have to their father at any age. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJohn uses the metaphors of light and darkness and of “the Word” to tell the reader that he will be writing more about good and evil and about what God wants to tell people through Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “In the beginning”\n\nSome languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But “very long ago” is different from “in the beginning,” and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([1:51](../01/51.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1:1	er9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν	1	This phrase refers to the very earliest time before God created the heavens and the earth. It does not refer to time in the distant past. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Before the beginning of the universe there was” or “Before the universe began there was” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:1	z59q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος & καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος	1	Here, **the Word** refers to Jesus. It does not refer to a spoken word. ULT indicates this by capitalizing **Word** to indicate that this is a title for Jesus. Use whatever convention your language uses to indicate that this is a name. If “word” is feminine in your language, it could be translated as “the one who is called the Word.” Alternate translation: “Jesus, who is the Word, and Jesus … and Jesus was God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:2	u6xx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1	**He** here refers to Jesus, whom John has called “the Word” in the previous verse.

1:2	k8cf			ἐν ἀρχῇ	1	Here this phrase refers to the very earliest time before God created the heavens and the earth. See how you translated this phrase in verse [1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: “before the beginning of the universe” or “before the universe began”
1:3	gm5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “with him came into being everything that came into being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1:3	v4yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν ὃ γέγονεν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, John implies that God did it.

1:4	pz5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζωὴ	1	Here it is best to use a general term for **life**. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]]) If you must use a more specific word, consider that **life** here could refer to: (1) eternal life, which is the meaning John uses for this term throughout this Gospel. Alternate translation: “the means of receiving eternal life” (2) physical life, which would mean that this verse continues the discussion about the creation of the universe in the previous verses. Alternate translation: “the life of all living things” (3) both physical life and eternal life. Alternate translation: “the life of all living things and the source of eternal life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:4	ffbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἡ ζωὴ	1	Here, **the life** refers to the same life stated in the previous phrase. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and that life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

1:4	jzwk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, John is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “of people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:5	dgin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ φῶς & φαίνει	1	John uses **the light shines** figuratively to refer to God’s truth and goodness being revealed as if it were a light shining. This truth and goodness was revealed to the world by Jesus. He is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or with a simile. Alternate translation: “God reveals his truth and goodness” or “God’s truth and goodness is like a light that shines” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:5	y5ry		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ & καὶ ἡ σκοτία	1	Here John uses **darkness** figuratively to refer to what is false and evil. It is the spiritual **darkness** of the people in the world who do not love Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or with a simile.

1:5	w9ni			αὐτὸ οὐ κατέλαβεν	1	Here the word translated **overcome** could also be translated as “understand.” It could mean: (1) the evil forces in the world did not conquer God’s truth and goodness. Alternate translation: “did not conquer it” (2) the people in the world who don’t know God do not understand his truth and goodness. Alternate translation: “did not comprehend it” (3) the evil forces of this world neither conquered nor understood God’s truth and goodness. Alternate translation: “did not conquer or comprehend it”
1:5	yv8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸ οὐ κατέλαβεν	1	Here, **it** refers to the light mentioned earlier in the verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “did not overcome the light” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1:6	qa1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀπεσταλμένος παρὰ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “whom God has sent” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:6	gih6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	Here, **John** refers to Jesus’ cousin, often referred to as “John the Baptist.” (See: rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/johnthebaptist) It does not refer to the apostle John, who wrote this Gospel. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” or “John the Immerser” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

John recorded Jesus referring to this change as being “born again” in [3:3](../03/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]]) If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an expression that indicates spiritual rebirth rather than physical birth.

Alternate translation: “as a result of”
1:13	jtjr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐδὲ ἐκ θελήματος σαρκὸς	1	John is leaving out some of the words that this phrase would need in many languages in order to be complete.

1:15	lrd7			ὅτι πρῶτός μου ἦν	1	Here, **before me** means that Jesus existed earlier in time than John. This does not mean that Jesus is more important because he is older than John in human years.

1:16	avst			χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος	1	Here, **after** could mean: (1) the second “grace” replaces the first “grace,” which is the most common use for this word.

This does not mean that the law of Moses did not have grace and truth. Rather, John is indicating that the grace and truth revealed by Jesus is more complete than that revealed in the law of Moses. Although God revealed himself and his will through the law of Moses, he did so much more clearly though Jesus, who is God in human form. Alternate translation: “the law was given through Moses.

John is quoting from the book of Isaiah, and Isaiah is quoting the words of the person calling out in the wilderness. It would be best to indicate that by punctuating this material as a second-level quotation, since Luke is quoting from Scripture.

2:intro	jav2				0	# John 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ first sign: he turns water into wine (2:1–12)\n2. Jesus causes controversy in the Temple (2:13–22)\n3. Jesus’ ministry in Jerusalem at Passover (2:23–25)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Wine\n\nThe Jews drank wine at many meals and especially when they were celebrating special events. They did not believe that it was a sin to drink wine.\n\n### Driving out the money changers\n\nJesus drove the money changers out of the temple to show that he had authority over the temple and over all of Israel. As the Son of God, it was his Father’s temple that was being used inappropriately for making money. Therefore, he had the authority to drive out those who were misusing the temple.\n\n### “He knew what was in man”\n\nJesus knew what other people were thinking only because he is the Son of Man and the Son of God. Because he is the Son of God, he has supernatural insight into what other people were thinking and could correctly judge their intentions.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “His disciples remembered”\n\nJohn used this phrase to stop telling the main historical narrative and to tell about something that happened much later. The Jewish authorities spoke to Jesus right after he scolded the sellers in the temple in ([2:16](../02/16.md)). Jesus’ disciples remembered what the prophet had written long ago and that Jesus was talking about the temple of his body after Jesus became alive again ([2:17](../02/17.md) and [2:22](../02/22.md)).
2:1	rl16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	Jesus and his disciples were invited to a wedding. This verse gives background information about the setting of the story. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
2:1	vw9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ τρίτῃ	1	This phrase introduces a new event. The **third day** could refer to: (1) the third day from when Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel to follow him in [1:43](../01/43.md). According to the Jewish way of counting days, the first day would have been the day in [1:43](../01/43.md), making **the third day** occur two days afterward. Alternate translation: “two days after Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel” (2) the day after Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel to follow him in [1:43](../01/43.md). In this case, the first day would have occurred in [1:35](../01/35.md) and the second day in [1:43](../01/43.md). Alternate translation: “on the day after Jesus called Philip and Nathaniel” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

2:3	kt44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
2:3	spbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	οἶνον οὐκ ἔχουσιν	1	Jesus’ mother is using a declarative statement to give an indirect request. If this is confusing in your language, you can use a more natural form for a request. Alternate translation: “They ran out of wine. Could you do something to solve this problem?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
2:3	mge0			οἶνον	1	Regarding the drinking of **wine** in Jewish culture, see the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter.
2:4	xo8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
2:4	a2ji			γύναι	1	**Woman** here refers to Mary. If it is impolite for a son to call his mother “woman” in your language, you can use another word that is polite, or leave it out.
2:4	jc75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί ἐμοὶ καὶ σοί, γύναι?	1	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

2:4	v5x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὔπω ἥκει ἡ ὥρα μου	1	The word **hour** refers to the right occasion for Jesus to show that he is the Messiah by working miracles. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It is not yet the right time for me to perform a mighty act” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:5	d5wy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
2:6	y7p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume	μετρητὰς δύο ἢ τρεῖς	1	A **metretes** was equivalent to about 40 liters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the quantity in modern measurements. Alternatively, to help your readers recognize that the biblical writings come from long ago when people used different measurements, you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the metrete, and explain the equivalent in modern measurements in a footnote. Alternate translation: “80 to 120 liters” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]])
2:7	hv80		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

2:8	xbw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
2:8	y52q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς & οἱ δὲ ἤνεγκαν	1	Here, **them** and **they** refer to the servants at the wedding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “to the servants … And the servants carried” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:8	h9gr			τῷ ἀρχιτρικλίνῳ	1	The term **head waiter** refers to the person in charge of the servants who served the food and drink at meals and feasts.
2:9	t0zb			ὁ ἀρχιτρίκλινος & ὁ ἀρχιτρίκλινος	1	See how you translated this term in the previous verse.
2:9	yg44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	John provides this background information about who knew where the wine came from in order to emphasize the veracity of this miracle. The head waiter did not know that the wine was originally water from the water pots. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
2:9	xfwq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	φωνεῖ	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
2:10	qoch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶς ἄνθρωπος	1	**Every man** here is an exaggeration that refers to something being a common practice. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “A man usually” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:10	vu60		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πᾶς ἄνθρωπος	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, the head waiter is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “Every person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:10	mh3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ὅταν μεθυσθῶσιν τὸν ἐλάσσω	1	This means that guests were given the cheaper wine, which is of lower quality and inferior flavor, after their senses had been dulled by drinking too much alcohol and were thus unable to tell that it was inferior wine. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the cheaper wine when they have become drunk and unable to discern the quality of the wine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:11	sq53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	In this verse John provides background information about the events described in [2:1–10](../02/01.md). Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
2:11	ear7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀρχὴν τῶν σημείων	1	John wrote much about the miraculous **signs** Jesus did. Turning water into wine at the wedding is the first of those **signs**. See the discussion of **signs** in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “significant miracles” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:11	r5kb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Κανὰ	1	See how you translated **Cana** in [verse 1](../02/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
2:11	z3tk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐφανέρωσεν τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **glory** refers to the mighty power of Jesus that enabled him to do miracles. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “revealed his glorious power” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:12	gw2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	μετὰ τοῦτο	1	**After this** introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time afterward” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
2:12	mmkj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, **this** refers to the what took place in Cana that was described in [2:1–11](../02/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “After Jesus’ first sign in Cana” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:12	h9tu			κατέβη	1	This indicates that they went from a higher place to a lower place. Capernaum is at a lower elevation than Cana.

2:14	sa75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς πωλοῦντας βόας καὶ πρόβατα καὶ περιστερὰς	1	These animals were used for sacrifices in the temple. People were buying animals in the temple courtyard in order to sacrifice them to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “those selling oxen and sheep and pigeons for people to sacrifice to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:14	qu9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κερματιστὰς	1	Jewish authorities required people who wanted to buy animals for sacrifices in the temple to exchange their money for special money from the **money changers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “people who exchanged money for special money approved for temple use” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:14	i8lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθημένους	1	The next verse makes it clear that these people are in the temple courtyard. That area was intended for worship and not for commerce. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “sitting in the temple courtyard that was intended for worship” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:15	x6et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	Here John is telling his readers what Jesus did as a result of the commerce he saw going on in the temple.

2:15	nn6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	πάντας	1	Here, **them all** refers to the people selling the animals and the money changers.

2:16	h6qy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν οἶκον τοῦ πατρός μου οἶκον ἐμπορίου	1	Jesus uses **the house of my Father** to refer to the temple. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the house of my Father, which is the temple, a house of commerce” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:16	grg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ πατρός μου	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
2:17	c2pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γεγραμμένον ἐστίν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone had written” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:17	q91v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	γεγραμμένον ἐστίν	1	Here John uses **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament book ([Psalm 69:9](../../psa/69/09.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that John is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it had been written in the scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
2:17	jp55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	ὁ ζῆλος τοῦ οἴκου σου καταφάγεταί με	1	This sentence is a quotation from [Psalm 69:9](../../psa/69/09.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
2:17	pvct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	τοῦ οἴκου σου	1	Here, **your** refers to God and is singular. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “for God’s house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2:17	ua3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ οἴκου σου	1	Here, **house** refers to the temple, which is often called God’s **house** in the Bible. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “for your house, the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	gg1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καταφάγεταί	1	Here, the author uses **consume** figuratively to refer to Jesus’ intense love for the temple, as if it were a fire that burned within him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “will be intense within” or “will be like a fire that consumes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:18	r5rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	Here, **these things** refers to Jesus’ actions against the animal sellers and money changers in the temple. (See the discussion of this event in the General Notes to this chapter.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “these disruptive activities in the temple” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:19	mp6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	λύσατε τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερῶ αὐτόν	1	This is an imperative, but it should be translated as introducing a hypothetical situation rather than as a command. Jesus is stating a hypothetical situation in which the event in the second clause would happen if the event in the first clause took place. In this case, Jesus would certainly **raise** the **temple** up if the Jewish authorities were to **destroy** it. Alternate translation: “If you destroy this temple, then in three days I will raise it up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
2:19	of4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	λύσατε τὸν ναὸν τοῦτον, καὶ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερῶ αὐτόν	1	Here, John records Jesus using the words **Destroy** and **raise** figuratively to describe his killing and resurrection, as if tearing down and rebuilding a building. However, the Jewish leaders did not understand this and Jesus does not explain the metaphor to them. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
2:20	qb4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	σὺ ἐν τρισὶν ἡμέραις ἐγερεῖς αὐτόν?	1	The Jewish leaders are using the question form for emphasis. They think that Jesus wants to tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you cannot possibly rebuild it in three days!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
2:21	g6jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\n[Verses 21–22](../02/21.md) are a comment John made about the story that was described in [2:13–20](../02/13.md). These verses tell about something that happened later. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
2:21	b440		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐκεῖνος δὲ ἔλεγεν	1	Here, **that one** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “But Jesus was speaking” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:22	oznm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	**Therefore** indicates that in this verse John is giving the result of Jesus making the statement in [2:19](../02/19.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Because Jesus said this about his body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:22	jejg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγέρθη ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, John implies that God did it. Alternate translation: “God raised him from the dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
2:22	nxug			ἐμνήσθησαν οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ	1	Here, John is speaking about something that happened long after the event described in the previous verses. See the discussion of this in the General Notes to this chapter.
2:22	ewi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτο & τῷ λόγῳ ὃν εἶπεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Here, **this** and **the word** refer back to Jesus’ statement in [2:19](../02/19.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “this statement about his body … the word about his body that Jesus had spoken” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:22	gq2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τῇ Γραφῇ	1	John is speaking of **the Scripture** in general, not of one particular book within the Bible. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “the scriptures” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
2:23	kvn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ὡς δὲ ἦν ἐν τοῖς Ἱεροσολύμοις	1	**Now** here introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after the previous events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time later” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
2:23	n807			ἐν τῷ Πάσχα ἐν τῇ ἑορτῇ	1	These two phrases could refer to: (1) two different parts of the festival, **the Passover** referring to the first day of **the festival**, and **the festival** referring to the Festival of Unleavened Bread that begins at Passover and was one week long. Alternate translation: “at the Passover, during the Festival of Unleavened Bread” (2) the same event. Alternate translation: “at the Passover festival”
2:23	w3qv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπίστευσαν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **name** represents the person of Jesus. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “believed in him” or “trusted in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:23	ipd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	θεωροῦντες αὐτοῦ τὰ σημεῖα	1	Here, **seeing** indicates the reason why the people were believing in Jesus. These people were only believing in Jesus because of the miracles he performed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “because they saw his signs” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:23	u65n			τὰ σημεῖα	1	See how you translated **signs** in [2:11](../02/11.md). See also the discussion of **signs** in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “significant miracles”
2:24	cm49			οὐκ ἐπίστευεν αὑτὸν αὐτοῖς	1	Although many people were believing in him, Jesus knew that their belief was superficial and only lasted as long as he performed miracles for them. Therefore, he did not trust them the way he trusted his true disciples. Alternate translation: “did not trust them as true disciples” or “did not believe their belief in him”
2:24	f2n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τὸ αὐτὸν γινώσκειν πάντας	1	Although the word **men** is masculine, John is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “he knew all people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:25	et23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	περὶ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου & τί ἦν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ	1	Although both instances of the word **man** are masculine, John is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “about mankind … what was in mankind” or “about people … what was in people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:25	lxro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ἦν ἐν τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ	1	This refers to the inner thoughts and desires of people, which some cultures refer to as “the heart.” (See the discussion of this in the General Notes to this chapter.) If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “what people think” or “the thoughts and desires people have” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:intro	i7a7				0	# John 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Jesus teaches Nicodemus about being born again (3:1–21)\n2. John the Baptist testifies about Jesus (3:22–36)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Light and Darkness\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong, and to begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### The kingdom of God\n\nThe kingdom of God is a concept that is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when Jesus returns and rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is God ruling and people embracing God’s rule over their lives. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])\n\n### Born again\n\nA major idea in this chapter is the spiritual new birth that Jesus says is necessary in order for someone to enter the kingdom of God [3:3–8](../03/03.md). Jesus also uses the following expressions to refer to being born again: “born from water and the Spirit” ([3:4](../03/04.md)) and “born from the Spirit” ([3:6,8](../03/06.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]])\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” twice in this chapter ([3:13–14](../03/13.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
3:1	yl6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	**Now** here introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related in the previous chapter. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time later” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
3:1	s9p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἦν & ἄνθρωπος ἐκ τῶν Φαρισαίων, Νικόδημος ὄνομα αὐτῷ,	1	Here, **there was a man** is used to introduce Nicodemus as a new character in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The phrase **from the Pharisees** identifies him as member of a strict Jewish religious sect. Alternate translation: “there was a man named Nicodemus, who was a member of a strict Jewish religious group” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
3:1	fz6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄρχων τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	This phrase means that Nicodemus was a member of the Jewish religious leadership, specifically the Jewish council called the Sanhedrin which made decisions about Jewish law. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/council]]) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “a member of the Jewish ruling council” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:2	sxo1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1	**This one** here refers to Nicodemus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Nicodemus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

3:2	skq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οἴδαμεν	1	Here, **we** is exclusive. Nicodemus is only referring to himself and the other members of the Jewish council. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:2	hxcr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐὰν μὴ ᾖ ὁ Θεὸς μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Here, Nicodemus uses **with him** figuratively to refer to God’s help. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without God’s help” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:3	nz18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν, λέγω σοι	1	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the truth of the statement that follows. See how you translated this phrase in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:3	svpx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν	1	The phrase **born again** is a metaphor that refers to spiritual rebirth. See the discussion of this expression in the General Notes to this chapter. Nicodemus does not understand this metaphor and Jesus does not explain it to him in this verse. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
3:3	t8pt			γεννηθῇ ἄνωθεν	1	Here, the word translated **again** could also be translated as “from above.” It could refer to: (1) spiritual rebirth as a second birth that takes place in addition to physical birth. Alternate translation, as in the ULT: “would be born again” (2) spiritual rebirth as a birth that is caused by God, in which case “above” is a euphemism for God. Alternate translation: “would be born from above” (3) spiritual rebirth as both a second birth and a birth caused by God. See the discussion of John’s use of double meaning in Part 3 of the Introduction to this book. Alternate translation: “would be born again by God”

Alternate translation: “to experience the kingdom of God” or “to participate in the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:3	ikj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here this phrase refers to both the place where God currently rules in heaven and to the earth when God rules over it in the future. See the discussion of this concept in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “the place where God rules” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:4	z64b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
3:4	wa1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται ἄνθρωπος γεννηθῆναι, γέρων ὤν?	1	Nicodemus uses this question to emphasize that this cannot happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “A man certainly cannot be born again when he is old!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:4	yk9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ δύναται εἰς τὴν κοιλίαν τῆς μητρὸς αὐτοῦ δεύτερον εἰσελθεῖν καὶ γεννηθῆναι?	1	Nicodemus uses this question to emphasize his belief that a second birth is impossible.

3:5	n6d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γεννηθῇ ἐξ ὕδατος καὶ Πνεύματος	1	The phrase **born from water and Spirit** could refer to: (1) spiritual birth that includes cleansing from sin and spiritual transformation by the Holy Spirit. In this case, Jesus’ words would be understood as a reference to Ezekiel 36:25–27, which Nicodemus would have been familiar with. Alternate translation: “would be born again by cleansing and the Spirit.” (2) physical birth and spiritual birth. Alternate translation: “would be born physically and spiritually” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	e1dj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here Jesus uses **enter into** figuratively to refer to experiencing something. The meaning is similar to the meaning of “see” in [3:3](../03/03.md). Alternate translation: “to experience the kingdom of God” or “to participate in the kingdom of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:5	m37g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:3](../03/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:6	gswx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τῆς σαρκὸς	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “What flesh has given birth to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
3:6	rru5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῆς σαρκὸς, σάρξ ἐστιν	1	Here Jesus is describing human beings figuratively by referring to something associated with them, the **flesh** they are made of. The word **flesh** here does not refer to sinful human nature as it does in other verses in the New Testament. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a human being is a human being” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
3:6	v3g8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ γεγεννημένον ἐκ τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, **the Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit, who enables people to be born again. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “what has been born again by means of the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:6	lfg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πνεῦμά	1	Here, **spirit** refers to the new spiritual nature that God gives a person when they are born again. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]]) If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “a new spiritual nature” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:7	t2sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	γεννηθῆναι ἄνωθεν	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:3](../03/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
3:8	p87y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ πνεῦμα ὅπου θέλει, πνεῖ	1	The word translated **wind** can also mean spirit. Jesus here speaks figuratively of the Holy Spirit, as if he were **wind**. Just like people in Jesus’ time could not understand how the **wind** blew but could observe the effects of the wind, people cannot understand how the Holy Spirit works but can witness the effects of his work. If this might confuse your readers, you could express this with a simile. Alternate translation: “The Holy Spirit is like the wind that blows wherever it wants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:8	mxjc			οὕτως ἐστὶν	1	This phrase connects this sentence with the previous sentence. In the same way that people cannot understand the wind but recognize its effects, people who are not born from the Spirit cannot understand those who are born from the Spirit but can recognize the effects of the new birth. Alternate translation: “So it is with” or “So it happens with”
3:8	k9ay			ὁ γεγεννημένος ἐκ τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:6](../03/06.md).
3:8	wh4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Πνεύματος	1	Here, **the Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit, who enables people to be born again. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:9	g4ji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται ταῦτα γενέσθαι?	1	This question could be: (1) a genuine question that shows that Nicodemus is confused. Alternate translation: “How are these things possible” (2) a rhetorical question Nicodemus uses to add emphasis to the statement. Alternate translation: “These things cannot be!” or “These things are impossible!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:9	phe2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	Here, **these things** refers to all that Jesus had spoken in [3:3–8](../03/03.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “these things you have just told me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:10	gw2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	σὺ εἶ ὁ διδάσκαλος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ, καὶ ταῦτα οὐ γινώσκεις	1	Jesus is using the question form for emphasis. He is not asking Nicodemus a question in order to get information. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are a teacher of Israel, so I am surprised you do not understand these things!” or “You are a teacher of Israel, so you should understand these things!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:10	gbu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	σὺ εἶ ὁ διδάσκαλος & οὐ γινώσκεις	1	The word **you** is singular and refers to Nicodemus.

3:10	ljiy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ διδάσκαλος τοῦ Ἰσραὴλ	1	Here, **the teacher** indicates that Nicodemus was recognized as a master teacher and religious authority in the land of Israel.

Alternate translation: “these things you have just told me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

3:11	upi7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ὃ οἴδαμεν λαλοῦμεν & τὴν μαρτυρίαν ἡμῶν	1	When Jesus says **we** and **our** in this verse, he was not including Nicodemus. Jesus used these pronouns as a contrast to Nicodemus saying **we** in [3:2](../03/02.md). While Nicodemus used **we** to refer to himself and the other Jewish religious leaders, Jesus could have been referring to: (1) himself and his disciples. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “my disciples and I speak what we know … our testimony” (2) himself and the other members of the Godhead. Alternate translation: “the Father, Spirit, and I speak what we know … our testimony” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:11	j1k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	οὐ λαμβάνετε	1	The word **you** is plural and could refer to: (1) the Jewish people in general.

3:12	y4e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ τὰ ἐπίγεια εἶπον ὑμῖν	1	John records Jesus speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Jesus is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since I told you earthly things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:12	pt4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	εἶπον ὑμῖν & οὐ πιστεύετε, πῶς ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν & πιστεύσετε	1	Throughout this verse, **you** is plural and could refer to: (1) the Jewish people in general.

3:12	c6ia		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς ἐὰν εἴπω ὑμῖν τὰ ἐπουράνια, πιστεύσετε?	1	Jesus uses a question to emphasize the disbelief of Nicodemus and the Jews. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you certainly will not believe if I tell you about heavenly things!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:12	dfqi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ἐπουράνια	1	Here, **heavenly things** refers to things that take place in heaven or are related to heaven. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “truths about what takes place in heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	ld0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ καταβάς	1	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person.

3:13	ocj0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus uses it to claim that role subtly and implicitly. You may want to translate this title directly into your language. On the other hand, if you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what it means. See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:14	tb3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	καὶ καθὼς Μωϋσῆς ὕψωσεν τὸν ὄφιν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1	In this verse, John records Jesus comparing his crucifixion to Moses lifting up a bronze snake. John assumes that his readers will know that Jesus is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, the Israelites complained against God, and God punished them by sending poisonous snakes to kill them. God then told Moses to make a bronze snake and raise it up on a pole so that whoever was bitten by one of the poisonous snakes and looked at the bronze snake would not die. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation: “And just as Moses lifted up the bronze serpent on a pole when the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
3:14	f9yi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑψωθῆναι δεῖ τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

3:14	krir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	See how you translated this phrase in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

3:16	vg6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that Jesus is giving a reason why the statement in the previous two verses is true.

3:16	h4ht			οὕτως & ἠγάπησεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν κόσμον	1	Here, **so** could refer to: (1) the manner in which God loved the world. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “God loved the world in this way” (2) the degree to which God loved the world. Alternate translation: “God loved the world so much” (3) both the manner in which and the degree to which God loved the world. For this interpretation, see the discussion of John’s use of double meaning in Part 3 of the Introduction to this book. Alternate translation: “in this way God loved the world so much”
3:16	uxc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν κόσμον	1	Here, **world** refers to the people who live in it. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people in the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

3:17	k8rf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	**For** here indicates that Jesus is giving a reason why the statement in the previous verse is true.

4:intro	j1hv				0	# John 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus leaves Judea for Galilee (4:1–6)\n2. Jesus meets a Samaritan woman (4:7–14)\n3. Jesus teaches the Samaritan woman about worship (4:15–26)\n4. Jesus teaches his disciples about evangelism (4:27–38)\n5. Jesus’ ministry in Samaria (4:39–42)\n6. Jesus goes to Galilee (4:43–45)\n7. Jesus’ second sign: he heals an official’s son (4:46–54)\n\n[John 4:7–38](../04/07.md) forms one story centered on the teaching of Jesus as the “living water” who gives eternal life to all who believe in him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “It was necessary for him to pass through Samaria”\n\nJews avoided traveling through the region of Samaria, because Jews and Samaritans were longtime enemies who hated each other. So Jesus did what most Jews did not want to do. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/samaria]])\n\n### “an hour is coming”\n\nJesus used these words to begin prophecies about events that could be shorter or longer than sixty minutes. In such instances, “hour” refers to a point in time when something happens, not a set length of time. For example, “an hour … when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth” refers to the point in time when people begin to do so ([4:23](../04/23.md)).\n\n### The proper place of worship\n\nLong before Jesus came to earth, the Samaritan people had broken the law of Moses by setting up their own temple on Mount Gerizim ([4:20](../04/20.md)). Jesus explained to the Samaritan woman that in the near future it would no longer be important where people worshiped ([4:21–24](../04/21.md)).\n\n### Harvest\n\nHarvest refers to the time when people go out to get the food they have planted so they can bring it to their houses and eat it. Jesus used this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about Jesus so those people can be part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### “The Samaritan woman”\n\nJohn probably told this story to show the difference between the Samaritan woman, who believed, and the Jews, who did not believe and would later kill Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “in spirit and truth”\n\nThe people who truly know who God is and enjoy worshiping him for who the Bible says he is are the ones who truly please him. The place where they worship him is not important.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “After leaving Judea, he comes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
4:5	ff7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἔρχεται	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

Alternate translation: “Please give me to drink” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
4:7	urgd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	δός μοι πεῖν	1	Here, John records Jesus leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

4:8	u29c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οἱ γὰρ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ ἀπεληλύθεισαν	1	This phrase indicates the reason why Jesus asked the woman for water. The disciples had gone away and taken the tools for drawing water with them, so that Jesus could not draw the water himself.

Alternate translation: “because his disciples had gone away” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

He knows that the woman does not know the gift of God or who he is. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “You surely do not know the gift of God and who it is who is saying to you … Otherwise, you would have asked him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
4:10	i9eg			τὴν δωρεὰν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **the gift of God** refers to the “living water” that Jesus mentions at the end of the verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “God’s gift of living water”

4:10	zub5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὕδωρ ζῶν	1	The phrase **living water** usually refers to moving or flowing water. However, Jesus uses **living water** here figuratively to refer to the Holy Spirit who works in a person to save and transform them.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate her words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are certainly not greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his cattle!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
4:12	sj7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐξ αὐτοῦ ἔπιεν	1	Here, John records the woman leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

4:18	zpl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτο ἀληθὲς εἴρηκας	1	**This you have said** refers to the Samaritan woman’s statement in the previous verse that she did not have a husband.

4:21	tisq			γύναι	1	Here, **woman** refers to the Samaritan woman. If it is impolite to call someone “woman” in your language, you can use another word that is polite, or leave it out.
4:21	eccs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἔρχεται ὥρα	1	Here, **hour** refers to a point in time when something happens. It does not refer to a 60-minute length of time.

This is true because the Savior Jesus was from the Jewish people. This phrase does not mean that the Jewish people themselves will save others from their sins. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “for salvation comes from among the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

4:25	izgt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	When the woman said “us,” she was including the people to whom she was speaking, so this would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

4:27	p39j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἐθαύμαζον ὅτι μετὰ γυναικὸς ἐλάλει	1	In the culture of that time, it was very unusual for a Jew to speak with a **woman** he did not know, especially if they were alone or if that woman was a Samaritan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “and they were amazed that he was speaking alone with an unknown woman, because people didn’t usually do that” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:27	cbc9			τί ζητεῖς?	1	This question could be spoken to: (1) Jesus. Alternate translation: “What do you want from this woman?” (2) the woman. Alternate translation: “What do you want from him?”

4:29	dl18			μήτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστός	1	This question is not a rhetorical question. The woman is not sure that Jesus is the **Christ**, so she asks a question that expects “no” for an answer. However, the fact that she asked the question instead of making a statement indicates that she is uncertain. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a way that shows her uncertainty. Alternate translation: “Is it even possible that this is the Christ?”
4:30	d4fu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐξῆλθον	1	**They** here refers to the men or people from the town to whom the woman had spoken. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Your translation will depend on how you translated “the men” in verse [28](../04/28.md).

5:intro	qe17				0	# John 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ third sign: he heals a paralyzed man (5:1–9)\n2. Jewish leaders oppose Jesus’ ministry (5:10–18)\n3. Jesus says he is equal with God (5:19–30)\n4. Jesus’ witnesses are John the Baptist, Jesus’ works, God, and the Scriptures (5:31–47)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Healing water\n\nMany of the Jews believed that God would heal people who got into some of the pools in Jerusalem when the waters were “stirred up.” The man Jesus healed in this chapter was one of those people ([5:2–7](../05/02.md)).\n\n### Testimony\n\nIn the Bible, a testimony is what one person says about another person. What a person says about himself is not as important as what other people say about that person. In this chapter, Jesus tells the Jews that God had told them who Jesus was, so he did not need to tell them who he was ([5:34–37](../05/34.md)). This was because God had told the writers of the Old Testament what his Messiah would do, and Jesus had done everything they had written that he would do ([5:44–47](../05/44.md)).\n\n### The resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus mentions two resurrections, the resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment ([5:28–29](../05/28.md)). Regarding the resurrection of life, God will make some people alive again, and they will live with him forever, because he gives them his grace. Regarding the resurrection of judgment, God will make some people alive again and they will live apart from him forever, because he will treat them justly.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The Son, the Son of God, and the Son of Man\n\nJesus refers to himself in this chapter as the “Son” ([5:19](../05/19.md)), the “Son of God” ([5:25](../05/25.md)), and the “Son of Man” ([5:27](../05/27.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([5:27](../05/27.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John.

5:46	m9sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ	1	John records Jesus making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true.

6:intro	xe4t				0	# John 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ fourth sign: Jesus feeds a large crowd (6:1–14)\n2. Jesus’ fifth sign: Jesus walks on the Sea of Galilee (6:15–21)\n3. Jesus says he is the bread of life (6:22–71)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### King\n\nThe king of any nation was the richest and most powerful person in that nation. The people wanted Jesus to be their king because he gave them food. They thought he would make the Jews into the richest and most powerful nation in the world. They did not understand that Jesus came to die so God could forgive his people’s sins and that the world would persecute his people.\n\n## Important Metaphors in this Chapter\n\n### Bread\n\nBread was the most common and important food in Jesus’ day, so the word “bread” was their general word for “food.” It is often difficult to translate the word “bread” into the languages of people who do not eat bread, because the general word for food in some languages refers to food that did not exist in Jesus’ culture. Jesus used the word “bread” to refer to himself. He wanted the people to understand that they need him so they can have eternal life, just as people need food to sustain physical life. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### Eating the flesh and drinking the blood\n\nWhen Jesus said, “unless you would eat the flesh of the Son of Man and would drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves,” he was speaking figuratively of believing in his sacrificial death on the cross for the forgiveness of sins. He also knew that before he died he would tell his followers to commemorate this sacrifice by eating bread and drinking wine. In the event this chapter describes, he expected that his hearers would understand that he was using a metaphor but would not understand to what the metaphor referred. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Parenthetical ideas\n\nSeveral times in this passage, John explains something or gives the reader some background information needed to better understand the story. These explanations are intended to give the reader some additional knowledge without interrupting the flow of the narrative. This information is placed inside parentheses.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” several times in this chapter. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

This is possible because Jesus says in the next verse, “Moses has not given you the bread from heaven.” Alternate translation: “Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat” (2) God, which is who it referred to in the scripture the crowd is quoting. Alternate translation: “God gave them bread from heaven to eat” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
6:31	iiaz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἄρτον	1	Here, John records the crowd using the word **bread** figuratively to represent food in general that is needed to sustain life. The manna that God gave the Israelites from heaven was not **bread**, but a food that could be baked into **bread**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “food” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
6:32	e6s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the truth of the statement that follows. See how you translated this phrase in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
6:32	qgs7			οὐ Μωϋσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν	1	Here John records Jesus speaking in a way that emphasizes that **Moses** was not the source of manna in the wilderness. He seems to be correcting the crowd’s incorrect understanding of the scripture they quoted in the previous verse. Use whatever form best communicates this kind of negative emphasis in your language. Alternate translation: “Moses was not the one who has given you”
6:32	qwcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸν ἄρτον	1	Here John records Jesus using the word **bread** figuratively to represent food in general that is needed to sustain life. See how you translated this word in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
6:32	xwqx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀλλ’ ὁ Πατήρ μου δίδωσιν	1	This phrase serves two purposes. First, it implies that the **Father**, not Moses, was the source of the bread from heaven mentioned by the crowd in the previous verse. Second, it indicates that the **Father** is still giving bread from heaven, although not the kind of bread the crowd is expecting. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. You may also want to start a new sentence. Alternate translation: “Rather, my Father has given that bread and now gives” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:32	ega4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὁ Πατήρ μου δίδωσιν ὑμῖν τὸν ἄρτον ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ τὸν ἀληθινόν	1	Here Jesus is using **true bread** figuratively to refer to himself. However, the crowd does not understand this, and Jesus does not tell them this plainly until verse [35](../06/35.md). Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
6:32	c73l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

6:33	ri0m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὁ & ἄρτος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν	1	Here Jesus is using **bread** figuratively to refer to himself. However, the crowd does not understand this, and Jesus does not tell them this plainly until verse [35](../06/35.md). Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
6:33	sajx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ & ἄρτος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This phrase could mean: (1) the bread came from God. Alternate translation: “the bread that God gives” (2) the bread belongs to God. Alternate translation: “God’s bread” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:33	sfbk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὁ καταβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	This phrase refers to Jesus.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
6:33	rrf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζωὴν	1	Here, **life** refers to eternal life. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly, as modeled in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

6:34	j26s			κύριε	1	The crowd calls Jesus **Sir** in order to show respect or politeness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lord]])
6:34	z9zv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸν ἄρτον	1	Here, **bread** could refer to: (1) food in general, as the word was used by the crowd in [verse 31](../06/31.md). This would mean that the crowd did not understand that Jesus was calling himself the bread from heaven. Alternate translation: “food” (2) some gift from God of which the crowd was uncertain. This would mean that the crowd recognized that Jesus was talking about something more spiritual than mere food but did not understand that he was talking about himself. Alternate translation: “heavenly food” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
6:35	cr2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς	1	John records Jesus continuing the **bread** metaphor to refer figuratively to himself. In Jesus’ culture, **bread** was the primary food people ate to stay alive. Just as **bread** is necessary for sustaining physical life, Jesus is necessary for giving spiritual life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly or with a simile. Alternate translation: “Just as food keeps you physically alive, I can give you spiritual life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
6:35	yq25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ ἄρτος τῆς ζωῆς	1	Jesus uses **of life** to the source of the **life** about which he is speaking.

6:35	hvpi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς ζωῆς	1	Here, **life** refers to eternal life. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “of eternal life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “The one coming to me will be like a person who never gets hungry, and the one believing in me will be like a person who never gets thirsty” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
6:35	fpgo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρὸς ἐμὲ, οὐ μὴ πεινάσῃ; καὶ ὁ πιστεύων εἰς ἐμὲ, οὐ μὴ διψήσει πώποτε	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that anyone who trusts in Jesus will never lack spiritual satisfaction. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “The one who trusts me will certainly never lack spiritual satisfaction again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
6:35	a7my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐρχόμενος πρὸς ἐμὲ	1	Here, **coming** does not mean to merely come near Jesus. It means to believe in him and be his disciple.

6:35	kh35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ μὴ πεινάσῃ & οὐ μὴ διψήσει πώποτε	1	John records Jesus using a figure of speech twice in the same verse to express a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that has the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “will always be full … will always have his thirst quenched” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
6:37	vpz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατὴρ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
6:37	n6bk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρὸς ἐμὲ ἥξει & τὸν ἐρχόμενον πρός ἐμὲ	1	In this verse, **come** and **coming** do not mean to merely come near Jesus, but they mean to believe in him and be his disciple.

6:51	k4bo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	σάρξ μού	1	Here, John records Jesus using **flesh** figuratively to refer to his whole physical body. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:51	ee9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὁ ἄρτος	2	Here Jesus is using the **bread** metaphor slightly differently from how he has used it previously. Here it refers specifically to his physical body, which he would sacrifice on the cross to pay for the sins of those who believe in him. Since Jesus says this explicitly at the end of the verse, you do not need to explain its meaning further. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
6:51	c5z3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ τῆς τοῦ κόσμου ζωῆς	1	Here, **life** refers to eternal life. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly.

6:52	q5nw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἐμάχοντο & πρὸς ἀλλήλους οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι λέγοντες	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “then the Jews began to argue among themselves, and they said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
6:52	fj5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται οὗτος ἡμῖν δοῦναι τὴν σάρκα φαγεῖν?	1	Here the Jewish leaders are using the form of a question to emphasize that they are reacting negatively to what Jesus has said about **his flesh**. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

6:52	llc0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν σάρκα	1	Here, John records the Jews using **flesh** figuratively to refer to Jesus’ whole physical body.

6:53	r7hh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	φάγητε τὴν σάρκα τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου, καὶ πίητε αὐτοῦ τὸ αἷμα	1	Here Jesus is using the phrases **eat the flesh** and **drink his blood** figuratively. Just as people need to **eat** and **drink** in order to live, people need to trust Jesus in order to have eternal life. However, the Jews did not understand this. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
6:53	e2w9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	φάγητε τὴν σάρκα τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου, καὶ πίητε αὐτοῦ τὸ αἷμα	1	These two phrases, **eat the flesh** and **drink his blood**, mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that trusting in Jesus is the only way to have eternal life. Because Jesus’ **flesh** and **blood** are important concepts, do not combine them. Instead, you could communicate the emphasis in a way that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you would indeed eat the flesh of the Son of Man and would indeed drink his blood” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
6:53	hkr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου, καὶ πίητε αὐτοῦ τὸ αἷμα	1	Jesus is speaking of himself in the third person.

6:55	cik2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἡ & σάρξ μου ἀληθής ἐστι βρῶσις, καὶ τὸ αἷμά μου ἀληθής ἐστι πόσις	1	Here Jesus is using the phrases **true food** and **true drink** figuratively to say that he, Jesus, gives life to those who trust in him. However, the Jews did not understand this. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
6:55	j4ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἡ & σάρξ μου ἀληθής ἐστι βρῶσις, καὶ τὸ αἷμά μου ἀληθής ἐστι πόσις	1	As in the previous two verses, these two phrases mean basically the same thing.

6:56	u3w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἐμοὶ μένει	1	Here, and frequently in John’s Gospel, **remains in** indicates being united in a continuous personal relationship with someone. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. See the discussion of this expression in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “has a close relationship with me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:56	rjpa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	κἀγὼ ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here, John records Jesus leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

6:57	oczm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κἀγὼ ζῶ διὰ τὸν Πατέρα	1	Here, **live** refers to being the source of life or having the ability to create life. It does not mean to merely be alive. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and I cause life because of the Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:57	nhp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κἀγὼ ζῶ διὰ τὸν Πατέρα	1	Here, **because of the Father** indicates the reason why Jesus has the ability to cause life. God the Father gave Jesus the ability to cause others to live. Jesus explained this concept in [5:25–26](../05/25.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and I cause life because the Father has enabled me to do so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:57	dba2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	καὶ ὁ τρώγων με	1	Jesus is using **eating me** figuratively to refer to trusting him. However, the Jews did not understand this.

6:58	lb07		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔφαγον οἱ πατέρες καὶ ἀπέθανον	1	The phrase **ate and died** does not mean that the people died immediately after eating the bread.

6:60	t1me		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀκούσαντες	1	Here, John leaves out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

6:60	wf67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐστιν ὁ λόγος οὗτος	1	Here, **word** stands for what Jesus had just spoken to the crowd in verses [26–58](../06/26.md).

He leaves out the second part of the conditional sentence for emphasis. Many languages need to have both parts of a conditional sentence in order to make the sentence complete.

Alternate translation: “if you would see the Son of Man going up to where he was before, would it offend you?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

6:67	hoye		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	τοῖς δώδεκα	1	If your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known.

If this is not clear in your language, you could use express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You have words that give eternal life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:68	v12o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ῥήματα	1	John records Peter using the term **words** figuratively to describe the things that Jesus taught by using words. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the teaching” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
6:69	o3w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	When Peter says **we**, he is speaking of himself and the rest of the twelve disciples, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
6:69	qu0n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ Ἅγιος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	**Peter** uses **of** to describe **the Holy One** who comes from **God**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Holy One from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
6:70	m9ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἐγὼ ὑμᾶς τοὺς δώδεκα ἐξελεξάμην, καὶ ἐξ ὑμῶν εἷς διάβολός ἐστιν?	1	Jesus gives this remark in the form of a question in order to emphasize that one of the twelve disciples will betray him. Alternate translation: “I chose you, the Twelve, myself, and one of you is a devil!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
6:70	k335		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοὺς δώδεκα	1	See how you translated **the Twelve** in verse [67](../06/67.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
6:70	jl5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐξ ὑμῶν εἷς διάβολός ἐστιν	1	The word **devil** could mean: (1) one of Jesus’ twelve disciples was a wicked person whose thoughts and actions resembled those of the **devil** or was being influenced or controlled by the **devil**. It does not mean that this person actually was the devil in human form. It also does not imply that there is more than one devil. Alternate translation: “one of you is wicked like the devil” or “one of you is controlled by the devil” (2) one of Jesus’ twelve disciples was speaking harmful and untrue things about Jesus to others. This meaning is possible because the word translated **devil** can also mean “slanderer.” Alternate translation: “one of you is a slanderer” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
6:71	z9yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\nIn this verse John provides background information about what Jesus said in the previous verse.

6:71	joha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰούδαν Σίμωνος Ἰσκαριώτου	1	**Judas** and **Simon** are names of two men. This **Simon** is not the same as Simon Peter. **Iscariot** is a distinguishing term that most likely means he came from the village of Kerioth. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

7:intro	l712				0	# John 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus goes to Jerusalem for the Festival of Shelters (7:1–13)\n2. Jesus says his authority is from God (7:14–24)\n3. Jesus says he came from God (7:25–31)\n4. Jesus says he will return to God (7:32–36)\n5. Jesus says he is the living water (7:37–39)\n6. The people disagree about who Jesus is (7:40–44)\n7. The Jewish leaders disagree about who Jesus is (7:45–53)\n\nTranslators may wish to include a note at [verse 53](../07/53.md) to explain to the reader why they have chosen or chosen not to translate [verses 7:53–8:11](../07/53.md). These verses are not in the best and oldest ancient manuscripts. If the translators have chosen to translate these verses, then they will want to either put them in a footnote outside of the main text or mark them in some way, such as square brackets ([ ]), to indicate that the passage may not have originally been in John’s Gospel.\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Believing in him”\n\nA recurring theme in this chapter is the concept of believing Jesus to be the Messiah. Some people believed he was the Messiah, while others did not. Some were willing to recognize his power and even the possibility that he was a prophet, but most were unwilling to believe that he was the Messiah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n### “My time has not yet come”\n\nThis phrase and “his hour had not yet come” are used in this chapter to indicate that Jesus is in control of the events that are happening in his life.\n\n### “Living water”\n\nThis is an important metaphor used in the New Testament to refer to the Holy Spirit. See the discussion of this metaphor in the note about “living water” for [4:10](../04/10.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Prophecy\n\nIn [verses 33–34](../07/33.md) Jesus gives a prophecy about his return to heaven without explicitly indicating his statement as prophecy.\n\n### Irony\n\nNicodemus explains to the other Pharisees that the Law requires them to hear directly from a person before making a judgment about that person. The Pharisees in turn made a judgment about Jesus without speaking to Jesus.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Did not believe in him”\n\nJesus’ brothers did not believe that Jesus was the Messiah at the time the events in this chapter took place. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n### “The Jews”\n\nThis term is used in two different ways in this passage. It is used specifically to refer to the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus and were trying to kill him ([7:1](../07/01.md), [11](../07/11.md), [13](../07/13.md), [15](../07/15.md), [35](../07/35.md)). It is also used in [verse 2](../07/02.md) to refer to Jewish people in general. The translator may wish to use the terms “Jewish leaders” and “Jewish people” to clarify this distinction.
7:1	b99m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	μετὰ ταῦτα	1	This phrase introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “some time later” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
7:1	r94g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Here and throughout this chapter, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. Apart from one exception in [verse 2](../07/02.md), it does not refer to the Jewish people in general. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). Alternate translation: “the Jewish authorities” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:2	n2ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	In this verse John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about when the events happened. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “This event took place near the time of the Shelters Festival, the festival of the Jews” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
7:2	m4ch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	Unlike in the previous verse and throughout this chapter, **the Jews** here refers to the Jewish people in general. It does not refer to the Jewish leaders. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:3	x8ce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ	1	These were Jesus’ younger **brothers**, the other sons of Mary and Joseph who were born after Jesus. Since the Father of Jesus was God and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for a man’s younger brother, it would be appropriate to use it here. Alternate translation: “his younger brothers” or “his half-brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
7:3	id2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σοῦ τὰ ἔργα ἃ ποιεῖς	1	Here, **works** refers to the powerful miracles that Jesus was performing. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “your miracles that you do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:4	by1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ζητεῖ αὐτὸς	1	Here, Jesus’ brothers use the reflexive pronoun **himself** in order to emphasize their belief that Jesus wants to make **himself** famous. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “seeks for his own benefit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
7:4	uj59			ζητεῖ αὐτὸς ἐν παρρησίᾳ εἶναι	1	Alternate translation: “seeks publicity for himself” or “seeks public attention”
7:4	mc8r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ταῦτα ποιεῖς	1	John records Jesus’ brothers speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but they mean that it is actually true. Although they didn’t believe that Jesus was the Messiah at this time, they did not deny that he was doing miracles. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the brothers are saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you do these things” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
7:4	f33j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ κόσμῳ	1	Here, **the world** is used figurative to refer to all of the people in the world. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to all people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:5	mz2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	οὐδὲ γὰρ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ ἐπίστευον εἰς αὐτὸν	1	In this verse John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about the brothers of Jesus. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Jesus’ brothers said this because even they did not believe in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
7:5	bs7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ	1	See how you translated **brothers** in verse [3](../07/03.md). Alternate translation: “his younger brothers” or “his half-brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
7:6	bcul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
7:6	n5bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ καιρὸς ὁ ἐμὸς οὔπω πάρεστιν	1	This could mean: (1) It was not the right **time** for Jesus to go to Jerusalem for the festival because God had not yet told him to go. This meaning explains why he eventually went to the festival in verse [10](../07/10.md). Alternate translation: “Now is not the right time for me to go to Jerusalem” (2) It was not the right **time** for Jesus to publicly reveal himself as the Messiah, which is what his brothers wanted him to do. Alternate translation: “Now is not the right time for me to publicly reveal myself as the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:6	z9gv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὁ ὑμέτερος	1	All instances of “you” and **your** in verses [6–8](../07/06.md) are plural. They only refer to Jesus’ brothers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
7:6	shs9			ὁ δὲ καιρὸς ὁ ὑμέτερος πάντοτέ ἐστιν ἕτοιμος	1	Alternate translation: “but any time is good for you”
7:7	h7kv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὐ δύναται ὁ κόσμος μισεῖν ὑμᾶς	1	**The world** here refers figuratively to the people who live in the world. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “All the people in the world are not able to hate you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
7:7	s92r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	μισεῖ & περὶ αὐτοῦ & τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ	1	In this verse, **it** refers to the people in **the world**. If you translated **the world** with a plural noun, then you should change these pronouns to plural form as well. Alternate translation: “they hate … about them … their works” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
7:7	e5hq			ἐγὼ μαρτυρῶ περὶ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι τὰ ἔργα αὐτοῦ πονηρά ἐστιν	1	Alternate translation: “I tell them that what they are doing is evil”
7:8	ax6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς ἀνάβητε	1	John records Jesus saying **go up** to refer to going to Jerusalem, because that city is at a higher elevation than Galilee, which is where Jesus and his brothers were at this time. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate where they would go. Alternate translation: “You go up to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:8	evk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐμὸς καιρὸς οὔπω πεπλήρωται	1	This phrase means the same as “My time is not yet come” in verse [6](../07/06.md). See how you translated this phrase there. Alternate translation: “Now is not the right time for me to go to Jerusalem” or “Now is not the right time for me to publicly reveal myself as the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:10	jz6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	οἱ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ	1	See how you translated this phrase in verse [3](../07/03.md). Alternate translation: “his younger brothers” or “his half-brothers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
7:10	z4ym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ αὐτὸς ἀνέβη	1	See how you translated “go up” in verse [8](../07/08.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:10	rw5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	οὐ φανερῶς, ἀλλὰ ὡς ἐν κρυπτῷ	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that Jesus did not want to attract public attention in Jerusalem. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “very secretly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
7:11	i6cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ & Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:11	er5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποῦ ἐστιν ἐκεῖνος	1	Here, John records the Jewish leaders saying **that one** as a disrespectful way to refer to Jesus without saying his name. If your language has a similar way to refer to someone in an indirect but derogatory manner, you may use it here. Alternate translation: “Where is that so-and-so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:12	qc8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	γογγυσμὸς	1	Although the word translated **murmuring** usually refers to grumbling or complaining, here it refers to speaking quietly, without a negative meaning. Some people in **the crowd** were discussing who Jesus was and didn’t want the religious leaders to hear them. If your word for **murmuring** only has a negative connotation in your language, use a different neutral expression. Alternate translation: “quiet discussion” or “whispering” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:12	glq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τοῖς ὄχλοις & τὸν ὄχλον	1	Here, **crowds** refers to several different groups of people, while **crowd** refers to a group of people in general. See how you translated **crowd** in [5:13](../05/13.md). Alternate translation: “the groups of people … the group of people” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
7:12	c27a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πλανᾷ τὸν ὄχλον	1	Here the people use **leads** **astray** figuratively to refer to persuading someone to believe something that is not true. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he misleads the crowd” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
7:13	yyiv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	διὰ τὸν φόβον τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	John is using **of** to describe the **fear** that the people had for the Jewish leaders.

Alternate translation: “because of their fear that the Jews would harm them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
7:13	n8bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:14	yut8			τῆς ἑορτῆς	1	Here, **the festival** refers to the Jewish Festival of Shelters mentioned in verse [1](../07/01.md). See how you translated the word **festival** there. Alternate translation: “the Shelters festival”
7:14	jqnk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	Since only priests could enter **the temple** building, this refers to **the temple** courtyard. John is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:15	u12l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
7:15	obtt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐθαύμαζον	1	The word translated **marveled** refers to being amazed or in wonder of something in either a negative or positive way. Since the Jewish leaders despised Jesus, their amazement was unfavorable toward him. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “showed their surprise” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:15	e7ve		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς οὗτος γράμματα οἶδεν, μὴ μεμαθηκώς?	1	The Jewish leaders are using the form of a question to emphasize that they were surprised and annoyed by how much knowledge Jesus had about Scripture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “He certainly cannot know so much about the scriptures, not being educated!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:15	k8wh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος	1	Here, John records the Jewish leaders saying **this one** as a disrespectful way to refer to Jesus and to avoid saying his name. If your language has a similar way to refer to someone in an indirect but derogatory manner, you may use it here. Alternate translation: “this so-and-so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:15	oqzy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ μεμαθηκώς	1	Here, the Jewish leaders use **educated** to refer to receiving a Jewish religious education, which would include studying the Hebrew scriptures and Jewish religious traditions. This does not mean that they thought Jesus didn’t know how to read or write. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “not being trained in our scriptures and doctrines” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:15	z0db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἐθαύμαζον & οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι λέγοντες	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “the Jews marveled, and they said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

7:17	vlcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐστιν & ἀπ’ ἐμαυτοῦ	1	Here, **from** is used to indicate the source of Jesus’ teaching. A teaching could only have authority if God was its source. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “it is with God’s authority … only with my own authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:18	u5h6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀφ’ ἑαυτοῦ	1	Here, **from** is used to indicate the source of what the person is speaking. A teaching could only have authority if God was its source. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “by his own authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:18	z5bx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν δόξαν τὴν ἰδίαν ζητεῖ; ὁ δὲ ζητῶν τὴν δόξαν τοῦ πέμψαντος αὐτὸν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “seeks to make himself glorious, but the one seeking to make the one who sent him glorious” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:18	xf9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀδικία ἐν αὐτῷ οὐκ ἔστιν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **unrighteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he is not wicked” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
7:19	c7xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ Μωϋσῆς δέδωκεν ὑμῖν τὸν νόμον, καὶ οὐδεὶς ἐξ ὑμῶν ποιεῖ τὸν νόμον?	1	Jesus is using the form of a question to add emphasis. If your language does not use this type of question, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “It was Moses who gave you the law, but none of you obeys the law!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:19	c85j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τὸν νόμον & ποιεῖ τὸν νόμον	1	See how you translated **the law** in [1:17](../01/17.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
7:19	iwv8			ποιεῖ τὸν νόμον	1	Here, **does the law** means to keep, follow, or obey **the law**. If this use of **does** would be confusing in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “obeys the law”
7:19	bfd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί με ζητεῖτε ἀποκτεῖναι?	1	Jesus is using the form of a question to emphasize that the Jewish leaders who want to **kill** him for breaking the law of Moses are themselves breaking that law. If your language does not use this type of question, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You break the law yourselves and yet you want to kill me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:20	hdud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ὁ ὄχλος	1	See how you translated **crowd** in [5:13](../05/13.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

7:20	r9wi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς σε ζητεῖ ἀποκτεῖναι?	1	**The crowd** is using the form of a question to add emphasis.

7:21	l1zf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάντες θαυμάζετε	1	The word translated **marvel** refers to being amazed or in wonder of something in either a negative or positive way. Since some people in this crowd despised Jesus, their amazement was unfavorable toward him. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “you are all surprised” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:22	o9n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, **this** refers to someone doing something on the Sabbath to help someone else. More specifically, Jesus is referring to the time he offended the Jews by healing a paralyzed man on the Sabbath. This event was indirectly mentioned in the previous verse. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “On account of activities like healing taking place on the Sabbath” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:22	d8sw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	οὐχ ὅτι ἐκ τοῦ Μωϋσέως ἐστὶν, ἀλλ’ ἐκ τῶν πατέρων	1	Here Jesus provides additional information about where the Jewish practice of circumcision came from. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this type of question by translating these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Surely none from the rulers have believed in him, or from the Pharisees!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:48	zkmd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἀρχόντων	1	Here, **rulers** refers to the Jewish religious leadership, specifically the Jewish council called the Sanhedrin, which made decisions about Jewish law. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/council]]) See how you translated **rulers** in [3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: “a member of the Jewish ruling council” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:49	n0am		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	ὁ ὄχλος	1	See how you translated **crowd** in [5:13](../05/13.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

7:49	jk8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπάρατοί εἰσιν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God has cursed them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
7:50	u5ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὁ ἐλθὼν πρὸς αὐτὸν πρότερον, εἷς ὢν ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	John provides this information to remind us of who Nicodemus is and the conversation he had with Jesus that is recorded in [chapter 3](../03/01.md). Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “this man was a Pharisee who had spoken with Jesus at an earlier time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
7:50	yw8i			εἷς ὢν ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	Alternate translation: “although he was one of them” or “despite being one of them”
7:50	hj1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
7:51	ia3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ ὁ νόμος ἡμῶν κρίνει τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ πρῶτον παρ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ γνῷ τί ποιεῖ?	1	Nicodemus is using the form of a question to add emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this type of question by translating his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Our law certainly does not judge a man unless it might first hear from him and might know what he does!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:51	y8df		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	μὴ ὁ νόμος ἡμῶν κρίνει τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ πρῶτον παρ’ αὐτοῦ, καὶ γνῷ	1	Nicodemus speaks of the **law** figuratively as if it were a person. If this use of **law** is not natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “It is not written in our law that we may judge a man unless we might first hear from him and might know … is it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
7:51	c2h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἄνθρωπον	1	Here, **a man** does not refer to a specific man. It refers to any man in general. Alternate translation: “any man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
7:52	pt91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ καὶ σὺ ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας εἶ?	1	The Jewish leaders know that Nicodemus is not **from Galilee**. They ask this question as a way of scoffing at him. If your language does not use questions in this way, use another way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “You must also be one of those people from Galilee!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:52	k6pg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐραύνησον καὶ ἴδε	1	Here, John records the Jewish leaders leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the missing words from the context. Alternate translation: “Look carefully and read what is written in the Scriptures to learn” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
7:52	jm59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προφήτης ἐκ τῆς Γαλιλαίας οὐκ ἐγείρεται	1	The Jewish leaders believed that Jesus came **from Galilee** and that no **prophet** in the scriptures came **from Galilee**. Therefore, based on their reasoning, Jesus could not be a **prophet**. However, what they believed was incorrect. Jesus did not originally come from Galilee, but Bethlehem in Judea. Also, the prophet Jonah came **from Galilee** ([2 Kings 14:25](../2ki/14/25.md)) and [Isaiah 9:1–7](../isa/09/01.md) said that the Messiah would be a great light rising from Galilee. If your readers might not understand what the Jewish leaders are implying, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “no prophet rises up from Galilee, so this man cannot be a true prophet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
7:52	i0im			ἐγείρεται	1	Here, **rises up** means to appear. Alternate translation: “appears”

8:intro	e667				0	# John 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus forgives the adulterous woman [8:1–11](../08/01.md)\n2. Jesus says he is the light of the world (8:12–20)\n3. Jesus says he came from above (8:21–30)\n4. Jesus says he frees people from sin (8:31–36)\n5. Jesus describes the true children of Abraham and the children of Satan (8:37–47)\n6. Jesus is greater than Abraham (8:48–59)\n\nTranslators may wish to include a note at [verse 1](../08/01.md) to explain to the reader why they have chosen to translate or to not translate [verses 8:1–11](../08/01.md). [Verses 7:53–8:11](../07/53.md) are not in the best and oldest ancient manuscripts. Those ancient texts which do have these verses also have many differences between them, which are additional evidence that these verses were not originally in the Gospel of John. If the translators have chosen to translate these verses, then they will want to either put them in a footnote outside of the main text or mark them in some way, such as square brackets ([ ]), to indicate that the passage may not have originally been in John’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nGenerally in John’s Gospel, light represents what is true and good and darkness represents what is false and evil. Similar to the discussion of light in [1:4–9](../01/04.md), in [8:12](../08/12.md) Jesus applies the light metaphor to himself in order to show that he is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. Jesus calls himself the Light of the World because he is the one who enables people to know God’s truth and goodness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/light]])\n\n### I AM\n\nJohn records Jesus saying these words as an independent phrase three times in this chapter ([8:24](../08/24.md), [28](../08/28.md), [58](../08/58.md)). They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew expression “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses in [Exodus 3:14](../exo/03/14.md). For these reasons, many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([8:28](../08/28.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

8:12	m4ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent		0	In this verse Jesus begins speaking to a crowd near the treasury in the temple some time after the events of [John 7:1–52](../07/01.md). John does not mark the beginning of this new event. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:12	pvpr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	πάλιν & αὐτοῖς ἐλάλησεν & λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “spoke to the people again, and he said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
8:12	k5ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου & ἀλλ’ ἕξει τὸ φῶς	1	Here Jesus uses **light** figuratively to refer to God’s truth and goodness that are revealed to the world by Jesus. He is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. See the discussion of **light** and **darkness** in the General Notes to this chapter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “I am the one who reveals God’s truth and goodness, that is like a light, to the world … but will have that truth and goodness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:12	yc5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῦ κόσμου	1	Here, **world** refers figuratively to all the people in the world. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “of the people of the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:12	zf41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ ἀκολουθῶν ἐμοὶ	1	Here, **following** means to become Jesus’ disciple and obey his teachings. See how you translated a similar phrase in [1:43](../01/43.md). Alternate translation: “the one who becomes my disciple” or “the one who obeys me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:12	tse3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ μὴ περιπατήσῃ ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ	1	Here Jesus uses the phrase **walk in the darkness** figuratively to refer to living a sinful life. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “may certainly not live as if he were living in the darkness of sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:12	vw7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	φῶς τῆς ζωῆς	1	Here, John records Jesus using the **of** to describe **light** that gives **life**. If this use of the possessive form is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “light that brings life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
8:12	lvdg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς ζωῆς	1	Here, **life** refers to eternal **life**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “eternal life” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:13	ih9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σὺ περὶ σεαυτοῦ μαρτυρεῖς	1	The Pharisees assumed that their listeners understood that they were referring to Jesus testifying about himself without there being any other witnesses to confirm his **testimony**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are testifying about yourself without any other witnesses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:13	mrj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ μαρτυρία σου οὐκ ἔστιν ἀληθής	1	The Pharisees are implying that the **testimony** of only one person **is not true** because of a rule in the law of Moses. According to [Deuteronomy 19:15](../deu/19/15.md), a statement had to be confirmed by at least two witnesses in order to be considered true in legal decisions. If your audience is not familiar with the law of Moses in the Old Testament, then you can state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “your testimony about yourself cannot be true because the law of Moses requires at least two witnesses” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:14	bh68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμεῖς δὲ οὐκ οἴδατε	1	In [verses 14–20](../08/14.md) Jesus uses the plural form of **you** to indicate that he is speaking to the Pharisees. He is not speaking directly to those who believe in him. If this would confuse your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “but you Pharisees do not know” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
8:15	k92s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν σάρκα	1	Here Jesus uses **the flesh** figuratively to refer to human standards. Such standards are superficial and based on the limitations of sinful human nature. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “standards limited by human nature” or “superficial human standards” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:15	j79i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐγὼ οὐ κρίνω οὐδένα	1	This could mean: (1) Jesus does not judge anyone in the same manner as the Pharisees, that is, **according to the flesh**. Alternate translation: “I do not judge anyone according to the flesh” (2) Jesus is not judging anyone at that time. Alternate translation: “I do not judge anyone at this time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
8:16	ys2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ κρίσις ἡ ἐμὴ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I judge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
8:16	jb2f			ἡ κρίσις ἡ ἐμὴ ἀληθινή ἐστιν	1	Here, Jesus is contrasting the nature of the Pharisees’ **judgment** with the nature of his own **judgment**. Alternate translation: “my judgment is right” or “my judgment is according to what is true”
8:16	ev1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μόνος οὐκ εἰμί	1	Here, Jesus implies that he is **not alone** when he judges people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am not alone in how I judge” or “I do not judge alone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:16	cbrc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ πέμψας με Πατήρ	1	Here, this phrase refers to God. See how you translated this phrase in [5:23](../05/23.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:16	r7dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ & Πατήρ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
8:17	r2r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “Moses” did it. Alternate translation: “Moses wrote” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
8:17	l6ln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δύο ἀνθρώπων ἡ μαρτυρία ἀληθής ἐστιν	1	Here, Jesus is referring to a rule in the law of Moses. According to [Deuteronomy 19:15](../deu/19/15.md), a statement had to be confirmed by at least two witnesses in order to be considered true in legal decisions. If it would be helpful to your readers, then you can state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “if the testimony of two men agrees, then it is valid” or “if two men say something that agrees, then it should be considered to be true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:18	gfd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μαρτυρεῖ περὶ ἐμοῦ ὁ πέμψας με Πατήρ	1	In addition to Jesus himself, God **the Father** also **testifies about** Jesus. Jesus thus implies that his testimony is true, because there are two witnesses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “my Father, who sent me, also brings evidence about me. So you should believe that what we tell you is true” or “my Father, who sent me, also testifies about me. Therefore, my testimony is true” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:18	ayl5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ πέμψας με Πατήρ	1	Here, this phrase refers to God. See how you translated this phrase in verse [16](../08/16.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:18	ycc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ & Πατήρ	2	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
8:19	o66t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὔτε ἐμὲ οἴδατε, οὔτε τὸν Πατέρα μου. εἰ ἐμὲ ᾔδειτε, καὶ τὸν Πατέρα μου ἂν ᾔδειτε	1	In this verse, **know** refers to knowing who Jesus and God actually are, not just knowing information about them. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You know neither who I am nor who my Father is; if you had known who I am, you would have known who my Father is also” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:19	b26z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τὸν Πατέρα	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
8:19	wcd1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ ἐμὲ ᾔδειτε, καὶ τὸν Πατέρα μου ἂν ᾔδειτε.	1	Here, Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that the Pharisees do not know who he really is and do not really know God. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “you do not know me, because if you did, you would also know my Father” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
8:20	p01r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	In this verse John finishes telling about the events in the story by giving background information about where these events happened. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Some languages may require the information about the setting to be placed at the beginning of this part of the story in [8:12](../08/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
8:20	xa7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ταῦτα τὰ ῥήματα	1	Here, **these words** refers to what Jesus had just spoken in verses [12–19](../08/12.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “these things about himself” or “these things to the Pharisees” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:20	witr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ γαζοφυλακίῳ	1	A **treasury** is the place where treasures are stored. In Jesus’ time, the temple **treasury** referred to a place in the courtyard that had containers for receiving money offerings. If your readers would not be familiar with this use of **treasury**, you could give a fuller description. Alternate translation: “the place where people gave money” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
8:20	b11j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οὔπω ἐληλύθει ἡ ὥρα αὐτοῦ	1	Here, the word **hour** is used figuratively to refer to the time God had planned for Jesus to be arrested and killed. See how you translated this phrase in [7:30](../07/30.md). Alternate translation: “the right time to arrest him had not yet come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:21	ls93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	εἶπεν οὖν πάλιν αὐτοῖς	1	**Then again** here introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related. The story does not say how long after those events this new event happened. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “At another time he again said to them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
8:21	lxox		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἐγὼ ὑπάγω & ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω	1	Two times in this verse Jesus uses **go away** figuratively to refer to his death and return to God in heaven. However, the Jews did not understand this. Therefore, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
8:21	d70v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ἐν τῇ ἁμαρτίᾳ ὑμῶν	1	Here, **sin** is singular. This could refer to one: (1) the specific sin of rejecting Jesus as the Messiah. Alternate translation: “in your sin of unbelief” (2) sinfulness in general. Alternate translation: “in your state of sinfulness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
8:21	m0w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω, ὑμεῖς οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “You are not able to come to where I go” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
8:22	a4p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
8:22	upxp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μήτι ἀποκτενεῖ ἑαυτὸν	1	John records the Jewish leaders using the form of a question in a way that expects a negative response but also expresses uncertainty about that response. If your language has a question form that assumes a negative response with uncertainty, you should use it here. Alternate translation: “Could it be possible that he will kill himself?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:22	vskt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι λέγει, ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω ὑμεῖς, οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “Is that why he says that where he goes, we will not be able to come” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
8:22	mi1t			ὅπου ἐγὼ ὑπάγω ὑμεῖς, οὐ δύνασθε ἐλθεῖν	1	See how you translated this clause in the previous verse.
8:23	oc6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμεῖς ἐκ τῶν κάτω ἐστέ	1	In [verses 23–30](../08/23.md) Jesus uses the plural form of **you** to indicate that he is speaking to the Jewish leaders. He is not speaking directly to those who believe in him. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You Jewish authorities are from below” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
8:23	zug9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς ἐκ τῶν κάτω ἐστέ	1	The phrase **from below** could refer to: (1) the origin of the subject. Alternate translation: “You came from the things below” (2) the place where the subject belongs. Alternate translation: “You belong to the things below” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:23	tg9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν κάτω	1	Here, John records Jesus using **the things below** figuratively to refer to **this world**. It does not refer to hell. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are from this lower world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:23	a7ny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγὼ ἐκ τῶν ἄνω εἰμί	1	The phrase **from the things above** could refer to: (1) the origin of the subject. Alternate translation: “I came from the things above” (2) the place where the subject belongs, which is heaven. Alternate translation: “I belong to the things above” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:23	qlv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἄνω	1	Here, John records Jesus using **the things above** figuratively to refer to heaven. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am from heaven” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:23	svn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὑμεῖς ἐκ τούτου τοῦ κόσμου ἐστέ, ἐγὼ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἐκ τοῦ κόσμου τούτου	1	The phrase **from this world** could refer to: (1) the origin of the subject. Alternate translation: “You come from this world; I do not come from this world” (2) the place where the subject belongs. Alternate translation: “You belong to this world; I do not belong to this world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:23	w3vx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τούτου τοῦ κόσμου & τοῦ κόσμου τούτου	1	Here, **this world** refers to everything in the universe that has been corrupted by sin and is hostile to God. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this sinful world … this sinful world” or “this world that opposes God … this world that opposes God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:24	jgw4			ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν & ἐγώ εἰμι, ἀποθανεῖσθε ἐν ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ὑμῶν	1	This phrase **you will die in your sins** is different from the similar statement in verse [21](../08/21.md) because **sins** is plural in this verse but singular in that verse. Therefore, make sure that you translate **sins** differently than how you translated “sin” in verse [21](../08/21.md).
8:24	he1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι	1	This could mean: (1) Jesus is identifying himself as Yahweh, who identified himself to Moses as “I AM” in [Exodus 3:14](../exo/03/14.md). Alternate translation: “that I am the I AM” (2) Jesus expects the people to understand that he is referring to what he already has already said about himself in the previous verse: “that I am from above” See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes for this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:25	t7tv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἔλεγον	1	Here, **they** refers to the Jewish leaders. If it would be more natural in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the Jewish authorities said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
8:25	c106		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τὴν ἀρχὴν ὅ τι καὶ λαλῶ ὑμῖν	1	Jesus is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that he has already told the Jewish leaders who he is. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I am who I have been telling you I am since the beginning!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

8:26	n3gf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὁ πέμψας με & παρ’ αὐτοῦ	1	These phrases refer to God. However, since the Jewish leaders did not understand what Jesus meant when he used these phrases, you do not need to explain their meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
8:26	ivk5			ὁ πέμψας με ἀληθής ἐστιν	1	Here, **true** means to be truthful or to speak only the truth. If this use of **true** would be confusing in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who sent me is truthful” or “the one who sent me tells the truth”
8:26	xj8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κἀγὼ ἃ ἤκουσα παρ’ αὐτοῦ, ταῦτα	1	Jesus says that **the one who sent** him **is true** in order to imply that **these things** he **heard** and spoke are **true**.

8:26	lsc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ταῦτα λαλῶ εἰς τὸν κόσμον	1	Here, John records Jesus using **the world** figuratively to refer to the people who live in **the world**.

8:32	esz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ ἀλήθεια ἐλευθερώσει ὑμᾶς	1	Jesus speaks of **truth** figuratively as though it were a person who could **free** someone.

8:32	xf9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀλήθειαν & ἡ ἀλήθεια	1	Here, **the truth** refers to what Jesus reveals about God, which would include his plan for forgiving sinful people through Jesus’ death on the cross.

8:33	n34n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς σὺ λέγεις, ὅτι ἐλεύθεροι γενήσεσθε	1	The Jews are using the question form here to emphasize their shock at what Jesus has said.

8:35	sg4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ	1	Here, Jesus uses **house** figuratively to refer to the family that lives inside the **house**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as a permanent member of a family” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:35	mknn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὁ Υἱὸς μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα	1	This clause is in contrast to the previous clause. Although slaves do not remain permanent members of the family who owns them, sons are permanent family members. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but the son remains into eternity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
8:35	j73t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὁ Υἱὸς μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

8:36	w3q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ἐὰν & ὁ Υἱὸς ὑμᾶς ἐλευθερώσῃ	1	Unlike the generic use of **son** in the previous verse, here Jesus uses **the Son** to refer to himself in the third person.

If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or with a simile. Alternate translation: “you will truly no longer be controlled by sin” or “you will truly be able to refrain from sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:37	p4xm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἀβραάμ	1	**Abraham** is the name of a man, the most important ancestor of the Jewish people. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
8:37	orw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ λόγος ὁ ἐμὸς οὐ χωρεῖ ἐν ὑμῖν	1	This phrase **has no place in you** is an idiom that means to truly accept or believe something.

Alternate translation: “you do not receive my words in your hearts” or “you reject my words” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:37	ph1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος ὁ ἐμὸς	1	Here, **word** refers to the message or teachings of Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
8:38	m62y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τῷ Πατρὶ	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
8:38	f9yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	καὶ ὑμεῖς & ἃ ἠκούσατε παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς, ποιεῖτε	1	In this clause, Jesus uses the phrase **the father** to refer to the devil. Despite using the same words as in the previous clause, here Jesus is not referring to God. However, since Jesus did not yet reveal what he meant when he used this phrase, but was speaking ambiguously, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
8:39	qp2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ πατὴρ	1	Here the people use **father** figuratively to refer to their ancestor. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Our forefather” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “descendants of Abraham” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:39	xcnx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Ἀβραὰμ	1	Jesus is using **of** to describe **works** that were done by **Abraham**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the works done by Abraham” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
8:40	s615		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦτο Ἀβραὰμ οὐκ ἐποίησεν	1	Here, **this** refers to what Jesus said earlier in the verse about what the Jews were trying to do to him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Abraham did not seek to kill someone who told him the truth from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:41	i87r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ὑμεῖς ποιεῖτε τὰ ἔργα τοῦ πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus uses the phrase **your father** to refer to the devil.

8:41	y82e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡμεῖς ἐκ πορνείας οὐ γεγεννήμεθα	1	Here, the Jews imply that Jesus does not know who his real father is and that his birth is the result of an immoral sexual relationship. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “We do not know about you, but we are not illegitimate children” or “We were all born from proper marriages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:42	nh4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ ὁ Θεὸς Πατὴρ ὑμῶν ἦν, ἠγαπᾶτε ἂν ἐμέ	1	Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he already knows that the condition is not true. Jesus knows that the Jews speaking to him here do not love him and are not true followers of God. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “God is surely not your father, because if he were, you would love me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
8:42	mk2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπ’ ἐμαυτοῦ ἐλήλυθα	1	Here, **from** is used to indicate Jesus’ origin. He could only have authority if he came from God.

8:43	ig11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	διὰ τί τὴν λαλιὰν τὴν ἐμὴν οὐ γινώσκετε?	1	Jesus is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I will tell you why you do not understand what I say!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:43	yham		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐ δύνασθε ἀκούειν τὸν λόγον τὸν ἐμόν	1	Here, **hear** means to listen to something with the intent to heed it and respond appropriately.

8:43	cf8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τὸν ἐμόν	1	Here, Jesus uses **words** figuratively to refer to his teachings. See how you translated this phrase in [5:47](../05/47.md). Alternate translation: “my teachings.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

8:44	pmda		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνθρωποκτόνος ἦν ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς	1	Here, **the beginning** refers to the time when the first humans, Adam and Eve, sinned. It does not refer to the very beginning of time. The devil tempted Eve to sin and Adam sinned as well. Because they sinned, all living things die as part of the punishment for sin. Therefore, Jesus calls **the devil** a **murderer** for starting the process that brought death to the world. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation: “was a murderer from the time when he tempted the first people to sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:44	i1e4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ οὐκ ἔστηκεν	1	The phrase **does not stand in the truth** is an idiom that means to not accept or approve of what is true. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “does not approve of the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
8:44	j6rz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἔστιν ἀλήθεια ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here Jesus speaks figuratively of **truth** as if it were an object that could exist inside someone.

8:44	hqmo			ἐκ τῶν ἰδίων λαλεῖ	1	Alternate translation: “he speaks according to his character” or “he speaks what is most natural for him to speak”
8:44	k1qu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ	1	Here Jesus uses **father** figuratively to refer to the one who originated the act of lying. Since **the devil** is the first being to tell a lie, he is called the **father** of lying. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the first one to lie” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
8:44	x11i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ πατὴρ αὐτοῦ	1	Here, **it** refers to the act of lying. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the father of lying” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:46	y3gz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ἐξ ὑμῶν ἐλέγχει με περὶ ἁμαρτίας?	1	Jesus is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that he has never sinned.

Alternate translation: “None of you can convict me concerning sin!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:46	kh6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἀλήθειαν λέγω	1	John records Jesus speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what John is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since I speak the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
8:46	ibp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	διὰ τί ὑμεῖς οὐ πιστεύετέ μοι?	1	Jesus is using a rhetorical question here to scold the Jews for their unbelief. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you have no reason for not believing me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
8:47	lien		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ὢν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ & ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐκ ἐστέ	1	The phrase **from God** could refer to: (1) the person to whom the subject belongs, as in the UST. (2) the origin of the subject. Alternate translation: “He who came from God … you did not come from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
8:47	nmmq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ὁ ὢν ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Although **He** is masculine, Jesus is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “A person who is from God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
8:47	njo6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀκούει & ὑμεῖς οὐκ ἀκούετε	1	Here, **hear** means to listen to something with the intent to heed it and respond appropriately.

8:47	l7gy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Jesus uses **words** figuratively to refer to what God has said. See how you translated **words** in [5:47](../05/47.md).

8:48	vu1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
8:48	cic5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐ καλῶς λέγομεν ἡμεῖς ὅτι Σαμαρείτης εἶ σὺ, καὶ δαιμόνιον ἔχεις?	1	**The Jews** are using a rhetorical question here to accuse Jesus and to dishonor him.

9:intro	hq31				0	# John 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus’ sixth sign: he heals a blind man (9:1–12)\n2. The Pharisees question the formerly blind man whom Jesus healed (9:13–34)\n3. Jesus speaks with the formerly blind man and some Pharisees (9:35–41)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Who sinned?”\n\nMany of the Jews in Jesus’ time believed that if a person was blind or deaf or crippled, it was because he, his parents, or someone else in his family had sinned. The rabbis even taught that it was possible for a baby to sin while still in the womb. This was not the teaching of the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### “A sinner”\n\nThe Pharisees call some people in this chapter “sinners.” The Jewish leaders thought these people were sinful, but in reality the leaders were also sinful. This can be taken as irony. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### “He does not keep the Sabbath”\n\nThe Pharisees thought that Jesus was working, and so breaking the Sabbath, by healing the blind man. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n## Important Metaphors in this Chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n### Seeing and being blind\n\nJesus uses the healing of the blind man as a metaphor for spiritual blindness. Just as a blind man cannot see the physical world, a man who is spiritually blind does not recognize God’s truth, which includes his sinfulness and need for salvation. The blind man in this story is first healed from his physical blindness ([9:6–7](../09/06.md)), then from his spiritual blindness ([9:38](../09/38.md)). By contrast, the Pharisees are not physically blind but are spiritually blind. Jesus calls the Pharisees blind because they have seen him do great miracles that only someone sent from God could do, but they still refuse to believe that God sent him or that they are sinners who need to repent ([9:39–40](../09/39.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([9:35](../09/35.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
9:1	un4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	**And** here shows that John intended for the events in this chapter to be directly connected to what Jesus said in the previous chapter. In [chapter 8](../08/01.md), Jesus said that he is the Light of the World. In this chapter, Jesus demonstrates that he is the Light of the World by giving physical sight and spiritual light to a blind man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
9:2	hf1y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἠρώτησαν αὐτὸν & λέγοντες	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “asked him, and they said” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter. Alternate translation: “Teacher, we know that sin causes a person to be blind. Whose sin caused this man to be born blind? did this man himself sin, or was it his parents who sinned?” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:2	zzh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἵνα τυφλὸς γεννηθῇ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “so that he might be blind when his mother bore him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:3	q69k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἵνα φανερωθῇ τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here, John records Jesus leaving out some information that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “he was born blind so that the works of God might be revealed in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
9:3	agwa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus is using **of** to describe **works** that are performed by **God**.

9:3	omt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φανερωθῇ τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

9:3	j9re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here, **him** could refer to: (1) the man’s body, especially his blind eyes.

9:4	h231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	When Jesus says **us** here, he is including himself and the disciples who are with him. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
9:4	qs5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα τοῦ πέμψαντός με	1	Here, Jesus is using **of** to describe **works** that God wants Jesus and his disciples to do. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the works that the one who sent me demands” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
9:4	mv5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ πέμψαντός με	1	Here, **the one who sent me** refers to God. See how you translated this phrase in [4:34](../04/34.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:4	x8rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως ἡμέρα ἐστίν; ἔρχεται νὺξ	1	Here, **day** and **night** could mean: (1) the time when Jesus was on the earth with his disciples and the time when he was no longer on earth, respectively. Alternate translation: “while I am still with you. The time when I will leave you is coming” (2) a person’s lifetime and the time that person dies, respectively. Alternate translation: “while we are still alive. The time when we will die is coming” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:4	g92d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἕως ἡμέρα ἐστίν	1	Here Jesus uses **day** figuratively. He compares the time when he and his disciples can do God’s work to the daytime, which is the time when people normally work. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “while it is the time like the daylight hours when people usually work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:4	rloj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔρχεται νὺξ	1	Here Jesus uses **Night** figuratively. He compares the time when he and his disciples cannot do God’s work to the nighttime, which is the time when people normally cannot work because it is too dark to see. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “The time like the night hours is coming when people cannot work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:5	f2xu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ κόσμῳ	1	Here Jesus uses **world** to refer to the earth on which people live. It does not refer only to the people in the world or to the entire universe. Alternate translation: “on the earth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:5	dd8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	φῶς εἰμι τοῦ κόσμου	1	See how you translated this clause in [8:12](../08/12.md). Alternate translation: “I am the one who is like a light and who reveals God’s truth and goodness to the world” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:6	y3s4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐποίησεν πηλὸν ἐκ τοῦ πτύσματος	1	Jesus used his fingers to mix the dirt and **saliva** into **mud**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “used his fingers to mix the dirt and saliva to make mud” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:7	ily8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νίψαι & ἐνίψατο	1	Here, Jesus wanted the blind man to **wash** the mud off of his eyes in the pool and that is what the man did. Jesus did not want him to bathe or **wash** his whole body. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and wash your eyes … washed his eyes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:7	haum		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὴν κολυμβήθραν τοῦ Σιλωάμ	1	Jesus is using **of** to describe a **pool** that is called **Siloam**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the pool named Siloam” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
9:7	ror0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃ ἑρμηνεύεται, ἀπεσταλμένος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “which means ‘Sent’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
9:7	ri9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	ὃ ἑρμηνεύεται, ἀπεσταλμένος	1	In this clause John provides a brief break in the storyline in order to explain to his readers what **Siloam** means. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “which means ‘Sent’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
9:7	p54y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὃ ἑρμηνεύεται, ἀπεσταλμένος	1	John assumes that his readers will know that he is saying what the name **Siloam** means when translated from the Aramaic language into Greek. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “which is the Aramaic word for ‘Sent’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:7	q68b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἦλθεν	1	As the next verse suggests, the man **came back** to his home, not to Jesus. Your language may state “went” rather than **came** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “went back” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
9:7	rj0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βλέπων	1	Here, **seeing** means that the man became able to see before coming back.

9:8	d1vq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὅτι προσαίτης ἦν	1	This clause is missing some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

9:8	r79x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ καθήμενος καὶ προσαιτῶν?	1	The people here are using a rhetorical question to express their surprise at seeing the blind man who has been healed. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “This man is the one who used to sit and beg!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
9:10	m97n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πῶς ἠνεῴχθησάν σου οἱ ὀφθαλμοί?	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

9:10	yy53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πῶς ἠνεῴχθησάν σου οἱ ὀφθαλμοί	1	Here, **eyes** **opened** figuratively describes the ability to see by referring to something associated with vision coming into action, specifically, the **eyes**.

9:11	ajxb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀνέβλεψα	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sight**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I could see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
9:13	cu14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἄγουσιν	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
9:14	ef0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν πηλὸν ἐποίησεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς, καὶ ἀνέῳξεν αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς	1	The negative reaction of the Pharisees described in the following verses is based on their belief that, according to their religious law, Jesus’ actions were considered to be work. Therefore, they believed that he was disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]]). If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. These were two deeds the Pharisees considered to be work.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:14	qxy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἀνέῳξεν αὐτοῦ τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς	1	Here, **opened** **eyes** figuratively describes the ability to see by referring to something associated with vision coming into action, specifically, the **eyes**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “caused him to see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
9:15	d6xd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πάλιν οὖν ἠρώτων αὐτὸν καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι	1	Here, **again** means that this is the second time people questioned the blind man whom Jesus had healed. It does not mean that this is the second time **the Pharisees** questioned him. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then, in addition to his neighbors questioning him, the Pharisees also began asking him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:15	exy2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀνέβλεψεν	1	See how you translated a similar phrase in [verse 11](../09/11.md). Alternate translation: “he could see” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

9:16	hdh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ Σάββατον οὐ τηρεῖ	1	The phrase **he does not keep the Sabbath** means he disobeys the regulations for the Sabbath that God gave in the law of Moses. The Pharisees added many regulations which they considered to be equal with those that God had given. It was these additional regulations that Jesus was disobeying, thereby making the Pharisees very angry with him. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “he does not obeying our Sabbath regulations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:16	h0tt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔστιν οὗτος παρὰ Θεοῦ ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Here, **from** is used to indicate Jesus’ origin. He could only have authority if he came **from God**. Since Jesus was not obeying the Pharisees’ rules, they refused to believe that God had given him authority. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This man does not have God’s authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:16	k4sy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύναται ἄνθρωπος ἁμαρτωλὸς τοιαῦτα σημεῖα ποιεῖν?	1	Some people are using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that Jesus’ signs prove he is not a sinner. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “A sinner cannot possibly do such signs!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
9:16	qn73			σημεῖα	1	See how you translated this term in [2:11](../02/11.md). See also the discussion of **signs** in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. Alternate translation: “significant miracles”

9:17	glud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅτι ἠνέῳξέν σου τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς	1	Because the next verse indicates that the Pharisees did not believe that the man used to be blind, here, **since** does not mean that they thought the man had really been healed. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “since you claim that he opened your eyes” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:17	lcb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἠνέῳξέν σου τοὺς ὀφθαλμούς	1	Here, **he opened your eyes** figuratively describes the newly gained ability to see by referring to something associated with vision coming into action, specifically, the **eyes**.

9:18	y3wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	**Therefore** here indicates that what follows is the result of what the man said about Jesus in the previous verse. Because the formerly blind man believed Jesus was a prophet, **the Jews** who opposed Jesus refused to believe that the man had really been blind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Since the man said that Jesus was a prophet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
9:18	awp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Here, **the Jews** refers to the Jewish leaders, which in this chapter may have been a group of leaders among the Pharisees. See how you translated this term in [1:19](../01/19.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

9:21	ahky		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡλικίαν ἔχει	1	The phrase **full maturity** describes a person who is an adult and is legally responsible for himself. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “is an adult” or “is a full-grown man” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:22	yq73		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\nIn this verse John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about the man’s parents being afraid of the Jewish leaders. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

9:22	yjv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀποσυνάγωγος γένηται	1	Here John uses **put out of the synagogue** figuratively to refer to no longer being allowed to go into the synagogue and no longer belonging to the group of people who attend services at the synagogue. When people were **put out of the synagogue**, they were shunned by their local community. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he would not be allowed to enter the synagogue” or “he would no longer belong to the synagogue community” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:23	go77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡλικίαν ἔχει	1	See how you translated this phrase in [verse 21](../09/21.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:24	h1tl			ἐφώνησαν & τὸν ἄνθρωπον	1	Here, **they** refers to the Jewish leaders introduced in ([verse 18](../09/18.md))
9:24	bkx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	δὸς δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ	1	This is an idiom that Jewish people used when commanding someone to take an oath. It first appears in [Joshua 7:19](../jos/07/19.md) when Joshua orders Achan to confess his sin. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Speak the truth before God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
9:24	ww3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος ὁ ἄνθρωπος	1	Here, John records the Jewish leaders saying **this man** as a disrespectful way to refer to Jesus and to avoid saying his name.

Alternate translation: “this so-and-so” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
9:25	sr93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐκεῖνος	1	Here, **that one** refers to the man who had been blind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the man who had been blind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

9:27	cf2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί πάλιν θέλετε ἀκούειν?	1	The man is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize his amazement that the Jewish leaders have asked him to tell them again what happened.

Alternate translation: “I am surprised that you want to listen again to what happened to me!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
9:27	rpav		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	μὴ καὶ ὑμεῖς θέλετε αὐτοῦ μαθηταὶ γενέσθαι?	1	Here the formerly blind man actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. He knows that the Jewish leaders do not want to follow Jesus, but asks this question to ridicule them. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It sounds like you also want to become his disciples!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
9:28	h7hy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκείνου	1	Here John records the Jewish leaders saying **that one** as a disrespectful way to refer to Jesus and to avoid saying his name.

9:28	z2tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς δὲ τοῦ Μωϋσέως ἐσμὲν μαθηταί	1	Here, the pronoun **we** is exclusive. The Jewish leaders are speaking only of themselves.

Alternate translation: “Only a man from God would be able to do anything like that!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
9:33	pyin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ μὴ ἦν οὗτος παρὰ Θεοῦ	1	The formerly blind man is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true.

9:34	da3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἐν ἁμαρτίαις σὺ ἐγεννήθης ὅλος, καὶ σὺ διδάσκεις ἡμᾶς?	1	The Jewish leaders are using a question to emphasize their belief that this man was not qualified to question their opinion.

9:35	tw58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Here Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man”. However, the formerly blind man did not realize that Jesus was speaking of himself, and Jesus does not explain the metaphor to him until verse [37](../09/37.md). Therefore, you do not need to explain that Jesus is speaking about himself here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

See the discussion of these metaphors in the General Notes for this chapter. If these uses of these words would confuse your readers, you could use similes or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that those who know they are spiritually blind might receive spiritual sight, and those who falsely think they have spiritual sight might remain spiritually blind” or “so that those who recognize that they don’t know God might know him, and those who falsely think they know God might continue not knowing him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “The result of my judgment will be that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind” (2) the rest of the verse is an explanation of the **judgment** Jesus mentioned at the beginning of the verse, which may also require starting a new sentence. Alternate translation: “That judgment is that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
9:40	d8mm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	μὴ καὶ ἡμεῖς τυφλοί ἐσμεν	1	Several **Pharisees** are using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that they do not think that they are spiritually blind.

9:41	bj0s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἂν εἴχετε ἁμαρτίαν & ἡ ἁμαρτία ὑμῶν μένει	1	In these two phrases, Jesus speaks figuratively of **sin** as if it were an object that a person could possess or that could remain with a person. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you would not be sinful … You are still sinful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:41	jmq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λέγετε, ὅτι βλέπομεν, ἡ ἁμαρτία ὑμῶν μένει	1	See how you translated **see** in [verse 39](../09/39.md). Alternate translation: “you say, ‘We know God’s truth.’ Your sin remains” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
9:41	ch0y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	λέγετε, ὅτι βλέπομεν	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation.

10:intro	e8mb				0	# John 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus tells the Parable of the Sheep Pen (10:1–6)\n2. Jesus says he is the gate of the sheep pen (10:7–10)\n3. Jesus says he is the Good Shepherd (10:11–18)\n4. The Jewish leaders disagree about who Jesus is (10:19–21)\n5. Jesus says he is God at the Festival of Dedication (10:22–42)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Blasphemy\n\nBlasphemy is when a person claims that he is God or claims that God has told him to speak when God has not told him to speak. The law of Moses commanded the Israelites to kill blasphemers by throwing stones at them until they died. When Jesus said, “I and the Father are one,” the Jews thought he was blaspheming, so they picked up stones to kill him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nParables were short stories that Jesus told so that people who wanted to believe in him could easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. People who did not want to believe in him would not be able to understand the message ([10:1–6](../10/01.md)).\n\n### Sheep\n\nJesus spoke metaphorically of people as sheep because sheep do not see well, do not think well, often walk away from those who care for them, and cannot defend themselves when other animals attack them. God’s people are similar to sheep in that they also are weak and do foolish things like rebelling against God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/sheep]])\n\n### Sheep pen\n\nA sheep pen was a space with a stone wall around it in which shepherds would keep their sheep for periods of time, such as over night. There were large sheep pens in which multiple flocks were kept, and also smaller sheep pens for a single flock. Once they were inside the sheep pen, the sheep could not run away, and animals and thieves could not easily get inside to kill or steal them. In [10:1–5](../10/01.md), Jesus uses the sheep pen as a metaphor for the people of Israel. Out of the “sheep pen” of the Jewish people, Jesus calls his first “sheep.”\n\n### Laying down and taking up life\n\nJesus speaks of his life as if it were a physical object that he could: (1) lay down on the ground, which is a metaphor for dying, or (2) pick up again, which is a metaphor for becoming alive again.
10:1	gzd8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	General Information:	0	# General Information:\n\nIn [verses 1–5](../10/01.md), Jesus speaks a parable, which he then uses for teaching purposes in [verses 7–18](../10/07.md). Here, the “shepherd” is a metaphor for Jesus and “sheep” is a metaphor for people. “His own sheep” are the people who follow Jesus, and the **thief**, **robber**, and “strangers” are the Jewish leaders, including the Pharisees, who try to deceive the people. Since Jesus does not explain the meaning of this parable here, you should not explain the metaphors within the parable itself. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
10:1	ab9x			Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nIn [verses 1–21](../10/01.md), Jesus continues to speak to the Pharisees whom he was speaking with at the end of the last chapter. This section continues the story which began in [9:35](../09/35.md).
10:1	i3tj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἀμὴν, ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses this phrase to emphasize the truth of the statement that follows. See how you translated this phrase in [1:51](../01/51.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
10:1	xq1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	αὐλὴν τῶν προβάτων	1	A **sheep pen** is an enclosed or fenced area where a shepherd keeps his sheep. See the discussion of this term in the General Notes for this chapter. If your readers would not be familiar with this way of protecting livestock, you could use a general expression for a roofless space surrounded by walls or a fence. Alternate translation: “the walled area for protecting the sheep” or “the place where sheep are kept” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
10:1	zz7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κλέπτης & καὶ λῃστής	1	The words translated **thief** and **robber** describe two different kinds of criminals. A **thief** is a person who steals by stealth, but a **robber** is a person who steals by force or violence. For this reason, you may want to use “or” instead of **and** between these two terms. Alternate translation: “a thief or a robber” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:2	ib4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ποιμήν & τῶν προβάτων	1	Jesus is using **of** to describe a **shepherd** who takes care of **the sheep**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the shepherd who cares for the sheep” or “the shepherd in charge of the sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
10:3	uy2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ θυρωρὸς	1	A **gatekeeper** is a person who guards the sheep pen and opens the gate for the shepherd.

10:3	db3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰ πρόβατα τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούει	1	Here, **hear** could mean: (1) all the sheep in the pen **hear** the shepherd’s **voice**, but not all of them respond to it, as in the ULT. This meaning implies that there are multiple flocks in the sheep pen. (2) the sheep that belong to the shepherd heed or obey his **voice**. This implies that **the sheep** are identical with **his own sheep**. Alternate translation: “the sheep heed his voice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:3	zxsd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ἴδια πρόβατα φωνεῖ κατ’ ὄνομα	1	Here, **his own sheep** are designated as a separate group among **the sheep** of the previous clause. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “he calls his own sheep by name out from among all the sheep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:4	n1ta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν πορεύεται	1	Shepherds in Jesus’ culture led their sheep by walking in front of them. If people who take care of livestock in your culture do not do this, you might need to state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “he leads them to pasture by walking in front of them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:5	z8dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	τῶν ἀλλοτρίων τὴν φωνήν	1	Here, the word **voice** is singular in form, but it refers to all of the strangers’ voices as a group. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the voices of strangers” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])

Here, Jesus uses **gate** figuratively to say that he provides access into heaven, where God dwells. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “I am like the gate” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
10:7	wk8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ θύρα τῶν προβάτων	1	Jesus is using **of** to describe himself as a **gate** that is for **the sheep** to use.

10:8	k4z6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες ὅσοι ἦλθον πρὸ ἐμοῦ	1	**Everyone** here is an exaggeration that refers to the majority of Israel’s leaders, including the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders. Not every leader of Israel throughout history was wicked, but most were. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “Most leaders who came before me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
10:8	hqq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κλέπται & καὶ λῃσταί	1	Here Jesus uses **thief** and **robber** figuratively to refer to the Jewish leaders who were deceiving the people. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “like a thief and a robber” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

10:9	n70e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰσελεύσεται, καὶ ἐξελεύσεται	1	The phrase **go in and go out** is a common Old Testament idiom meaning to travel and move around freely in a safe environment.

10:33	w0v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βλασφημίας	1	Here, the **Jews** use the word **blasphemy** with its technical sense, which refers to a human being claiming to be God. This is what the Jewish leaders felt Jesus was doing in [verse 30](../10/30.md).

Alternate translation: “committing the crime of blasphemy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
10:33	h4kp			ποιεῖς σεαυτὸν Θεόν	1	This phrase means to claim to be God. It does not mean to try to make oneself into God or become God. Alternate translation: “saying that you are God”

Alternate translation: “It is certainly written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods”’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
10:34	tb1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἔστιν γεγραμμένον	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If this might be misunderstood by your readers, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “I, God, said, ‘You are gods’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
10:34	h189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ εἶπα, θεοί ἐστε	1	If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “I said that you are gods” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
10:35	nfly				0	Verses 35 and 36 are one sentence. In this sentence, Jesus argues by moving from a weaker reason to a stronger reason (an argument from the lesser to the greater). Based on the scripture he quoted in verse 34, Jesus argues that, since God calls humans **gods** in that verse, it is even more appropriate to call him God because he is the Son of God. You may need to change the order of the clauses in order for this idea to be clearer in your language.
10:35	ieot		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἐκείνους εἶπεν θεοὺς	1	**If** indicates a conditional sentence that extends until the end of the next verse.

10:35	g0kv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ δύναται λυθῆναι ἡ Γραφή	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you should not say to the one the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God!’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
10:36	fj9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	ὑμεῖς λέγετε, ὅτι βλασφημεῖς, ὅτι εἶπον, Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰμι	1	If the direct quotations inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the two instances of second direct quotations as indirect quotations. Alternate translation: “do you say … that he is blaspheming because I said that I am the Son of God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
10:36	wzhd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὃν ὁ Πατὴρ ἡγίασεν καὶ ἀπέστειλεν εἰς τὸν κόσμον	1	Jesus is referring to himself in the third person.

10:36	r7ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	βλασφημεῖς	1	Jesus is leaving a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

10:38	n8ue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐν ἐμοὶ ὁ Πατὴρ, κἀγὼ ἐν τῷ Πατρί	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing.

Alternate translation: “my Father and I are completely joined together as one” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

The Jewish leaders plan to kill Jesus (11:47–57)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Ancient Jewish burial customs\n\nAccording to the burial customs of that time, a dead person’s family would wrap the dead body with many strips of linen cloth and place it on a table inside a tomb. The tomb was either a cave or a room cut out of the side a large rock. According to Jewish tradition, the body was left to decompose in the tomb for one year. Then the family would place the bones in a stone box. If your readers would be unfamiliar with these burial customs, then you may need to provide explanations in your translation or in a note for [verses 38–44](../11/38.md).\n\n### Passover\n\nAfter Jesus made Lazarus become alive again, the Jewish leaders were determined to kill Jesus, so he started traveling secretly from place to place. The Pharisees knew that he would come to Jerusalem for the Passover festival because God had commanded all Jewish men to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem. Thus they planned to catch him and kill him during Passover ([11:55–57](../11/55.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “One man dies for the people”\n\nIn the law of Moses, God commanded the priests to kill animals so that God would forgive the people’s sins. In this chapter, the high priest Caiaphas says, “It is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes” ([11:50](../11/50.md)). He said this because he loved his “place” and “nation” ([11:48](../11/48.md)) more than he loved the God who had made Lazarus become alive again. He wanted Jesus to die so that the Romans would not destroy the temple and Jerusalem. However, God wanted Jesus to die so that he could forgive all of his people’s sins.\n\n### “The Jews”\n\nThis term is used in three different ways in this chapter. Unlike in other parts of John’s Gospel, it is used here primarily to refer to the Jewish people who were living in Judea, especially Judean friends and relatives of Lazarus. Some of these Judeans believed in Jesus and others opposed him ([11:36–37](../11/36.md)). The term is also used specifically at least once in this chapter to refer to the Jewish leaders who opposed Jesus and were trying to kill him ([11:8](../11/08.md) and possibly [11:54](../11/54.md)). Finally, the term is used in [11:55](../11/55.md) to refer to the Jewish people in general. The translator may wish to use the terms “Judeans,” “Jewish authorities,” and “Jewish people” to clarify these distinctions.\n\n### Hypothetical situation\n\nWhen Martha and Mary said, “If you had been here, my brother would not have died,” they were speaking of a situation that could have happened but did not happen ([11:21](../11/21.md), [32](../11/32.md)). Jesus had not come, and their brother did die.

11:1	s5im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἦν δέ τις ἀσθενῶν Λάζαρος ἀπὸ Βηθανίας	1	This verse introduces **Lazarus** as a new character in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. Alternate translation: “There was a man named Lazarus, who was from Bethany and was sick” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
11:1	b2r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Λάζαρος	1	**Lazarus** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

11:1	xoy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρίας & Μάρθας	1	**Mary** and **Martha** are the names of two women. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
11:1	p19k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	Μάρθας τῆς ἀδελφῆς αὐτῆς	1	Because those who wrote scripture usually listed the names of siblings in order from oldest to youngest, the list in [verse 5](../11/05.md) suggests that **Martha** was the oldest and **Lazarus** was the youngest of the three siblings. If your language uses different words for **sister** depending on birth order, use the word for an older **sister** here. Alternate translation: “her older sister Martha” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
11:2	c6r9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ἦν δὲ Μαρία ἡ ἀλείψασα τὸν Κύριον μύρῳ, καὶ ἐκμάξασα τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ ταῖς θριξὶν αὐτῆς	1	Here, John refers to an event that would happen at a time following the events recorded in this chapter ([12:1–8](../12/01.md)). If this might confuse your readers, you could translate this as a future event. Alternate translation: “Now it was Mary who would later anoint the Lord with myrrh and wipe his feet with her hair” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
11:2	xlio		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	ὁ ἀδελφὸς Λάζαρος	1	Because those who wrote scripture usually listed the names of siblings in order from oldest to youngest, the list in [verse 5](../11/05.md) suggests that Martha was the oldest and **Lazarus** was the youngest of the three siblings. If your language uses different words for **brother** depending on birth order, use the word for a younger **brother** here. Alternate translation: “younger brother Lazarus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])

11:3	i2ar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀπέστειλαν & πρὸς αὐτὸν	1	Here, John is leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply this word from the context. Alternate translation: “sent messengers to him” or “sent a message to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
11:3	g1im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	Κύριε, ἴδε, ὃν φιλεῖς ἀσθενεῖ	1	Here, the **sisters** are using a present statement to make a request indirectly. They tell Jesus that Lazarus is **sick**, because they want Jesus to come and heal him. If this use of a statement is confusing in your language, you can use a more natural form for instruction. Alternate translation: “Sir, behold, he whom you love is sick and needs your help” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
11:3	czm1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἴδε	1	Here, **behold** means to take notice of something or pay attention to something. It is used here to emphasize the urgency of the words that follow. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “take notice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:4	nk3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐκ ἔστιν πρὸς θάνατον	1	Here, **not to** indicates that what follows is not the result of the **sickness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “This sickness will not result in death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
11:4	q343		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἀλλ’ ὑπὲρ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus is stating the purpose for Lazarus’s **sickness**.

11:4	wln1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὑπὲρ τῆς δόξης τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the same idea in another way.

11:4	y9vx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα δοξασθῇ ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ δι’ αὐτῆς	1	Jesus is stating the second purpose for Lazarus’s **sickness**.

11:4	asqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus is referring to himself in third person. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the first person form, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
11:4	ad99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	**Son of God** is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
11:5	j6r4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	In this verse John briefly stops telling about the events in the story in order to give background information about Jesus’ relationship with **Lazarus** and his sisters.

11:5	w6tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τὴν ἀδελφὴν	1	Because those who wrote scripture usually listed the names of siblings in order from oldest to youngest, the list in [verse 5](../11/05.md) suggests that Martha was the oldest and Lazarus was the youngest of the three siblings. If your language uses different words for **sister** depending on birth order, use the word for a younger **sister** here. Alternate translation: “younger sister” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
11:6	vx3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	**Therefore** connects this verse to the previous verse in order to indicate that Jesus delayed going to Lazarus because he loved him and his sisters. Jesus’ delay is not in contrast to his love for them. Although Lazarus’s family would suffer for a short time, they would experience a great blessing when Jesus brought Lazarus back to life. Alternate translation: “Because Jesus loved them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
11:7	zq1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

11:8	y4jm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πάλιν ὑπάγεις ἐκεῖ?	1	Here the disciples use the form of a question to emphasize that they do not want Jesus to go to Jerusalem. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you surely should not go back there again!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
11:9	uv34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ δώδεκα ὧραί εἰσιν τῆς ἡμέρας?	1	Jesus is using the form of a question for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “There are surely 12 hours in the day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
11:9	ln4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐάν τις περιπατῇ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ, οὐ προσκόπτει, ὅτι τὸ φῶς τοῦ κόσμου τούτου βλέπει	1	Here Jesus speaks figuratively about **someone** walking **in the daytime** in order to comfort his disciples who were worried about going to Judea. In this metaphor Jesus uses **the light of this world** figuratively to refer to himself, who has previously called himself “the Light of the World” in [8:12](../09/12.md) and [9:5](../09/05.md).This whole metaphor could mean: (1) if Jesus and his disciples did God’s work during the limited time God had given him to work with them (**the daytime**), they would not fail (**stumble**) because Jesus was with them. This interpretation has a similar meaning to Jesus’ statement in [9:4](../09/04.md). Alternate translation: “If you do God’s work during the time I am here, you will succeed, because you are with me, the light of this world.” (2) someone who acts according to God’s will (**walks in the daytime**) does not fail (**stumble**) because Jesus guides that person. Alternate translation: “If someone acts according to God’s will, he will succeed, because I, the light of this world, will guide him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
11:10	vm6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	ἐὰν δέ τις περιπατῇ ἐν τῇ νυκτί, προσκόπτει, ὅτι τὸ φῶς οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν αὐτῷ	1	In this verse Jesus expands the metaphor from the previous verse about a person walking outside. In this metaphor Jesus uses **the light** figuratively to refer to himself, who has previously called himself “the Light of the World” in [8:12](../09/12.md) and [9:5](../09/05.md). This whole metaphor could mean: (1) if his disciples tried to do God’s work after the limited time God had given him to be with them (the **night** which comes after “the daytime”), they would fail (**stumble**) because Jesus would not be with them. This interpretation has a similar meaning to Jesus’ statement in [9:4](../09/04.md). Alternate translation: “If you try to do this work after I have left, you will fail because I, the light, am not with you.” (2) someone who does not act according to God’s will (**walks at night**) is an unbeliever who fails completely (**stumble**) because that person does not know Jesus. Alternate translation: “If someone does not act according to God’s will, he will fail because he does not know me, the light” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
11:11	fan2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
11:11	bev5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	Λάζαρος ὁ φίλος ἡμῶν κεκοίμηται	1	Jesus uses **fallen asleep** to refer to being dead. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant. Since Jesus explains the meaning in [verse 14](../11/14.md), you do not need to explain it here. However, If you have an idiom for this idea in your language, you may use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
11:11	ze1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀλλὰ πορεύομαι ἵνα ἐξυπνίσω αὐτόν	1	Here, **wake him out of sleep** refers to Jesus’ plan to cause Lazarus to become alive again. If you have an idiom for this idea in your language, you may use it here. Since the disciples do not understand what Jesus is saying here, do not translate this in a non-figurative way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
11:12	hn2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	εἰ κεκοίμηται	1	See how you translated **fallen asleep** in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

11:13	pf8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τῆς κοιμήσεως τοῦ ὕπνου	1	John is using **of** to describe **sleep** that is **slumber**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “sleep that is actually sleep” or “natural sleep” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
11:14	azy3			τότε & εἶπεν αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς παρρησίᾳ	1	Here, **plainly** means to say something clearly without using and metaphors or others figures of speech. Because the disciples did not understand the metaphor Jesus told them in [verse 11](../11/11.md), he told them the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Jesus then said to them in words that they could understand”
11:15	c4wj			δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	Alternate translation: “for your benefit” or “for your good”
11:15	ar2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἵνα πιστεύσητε	1	Here, Jesus is leaving out some words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply this word from the context. You may also need to start a new sentence. Alternate translation: “for I allowed this to happen so that you may believe in me” or “for I let Lazarus die so that you may believe that I am the Messiah” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

Alternate translation: “whom some people called Didymus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
11:16	ymy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Δίδυμος	1	**Didymus** is the name of a man. It is a Greek word that means “twin” and is Thomas’ other name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

11:18	d35v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance	ἀπὸ σταδίων δεκαπέντε	1	The word **stadia** is the plural of “stadium,” which is a Roman measurement of distance equivalent to about 185 meters or a little over 600 feet.

This could mean: (1) they believed that Jesus loved Lazarus, but doubted his ability to heal him. “He opened the eyes of the blind man, but he was not able to keep this man from dying.” (2) they thought that Jesus did not really love Lazarus because he healed the blind man but not him.

Alternate translation: “I certainly said to you that, if you believe, you would see the glory of God!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
11:40	mpl5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐὰν πιστεύσῃς	1	Here, Jesus is leaving out some words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete.

Jesus says that he is God (12:44–50)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry sections in [12:38](../12/38.md) and [40](../12/40.md), which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Mary poured perfume on Jesus’ feet\n\nThe Jews would put oil on a person’s head to make that person feel welcome and comfortable. They would also put oil on a person’s body after the person had died but before they buried the body. However, they would never think to put oil on a person’s feet, because they thought that feet were dirty.\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nJesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal, which was a common practice for kings. The kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on donkeys. So by riding on a donkey Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel.\n\n### Glory\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. In [12:16](../12/16.md) John says that the glory of Jesus is his resurrection and possibly his return to heaven as well.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Light and darkness\n\nIn [12:35–36, 46](../12/35.md), Jesus uses an extended metaphor in which light represents what is true and good, and darkness represents what is false and evil. He applies that light metaphor to himself in order to show that he is the embodiment of God’s truth and goodness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in [12:25](../12/25.md): “He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.” But in [12:26](../12/26.md) Jesus explains what it means to keep one’s life for eternal life.\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” several times in this chapter. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Some time later, six days before the Passover” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
12:1	bepc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Βηθανίαν	1	See how you translated this village name, **Bethany**, in [1:28](../01/28.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

12:1	z1jp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	Here, **raised** is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “had caused to live again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
12:2	ohcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μάρθα	1	See how you translated this woman’s name, **Martha**, in [11:1](../11/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
12:2	m6al		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῶν ἀνακειμένων	1	At a relaxed meal such as this one, it was the custom in this culture for host and guests to eat while lying down comfortably around a table that was close to the ground. You could translate this by using the expression in your language for the customary posture at a meal.

12:3	l85m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Μαρία	1	See how you translated **Mary** in [11:1](../11/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
12:3	c8kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	λίτραν μύρου	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in terms of modern measurements, either in the text or a footnote. A **litra** is about one third of a kilogram or three quarters of a pound. If your language does not measure liquids by weight, you may refer to its volume equivalent, which would be about half a liter. You might also refer to the container that could hold that amount. Alternate translation: “about half a liter of perfume” or “a one-half liter bottle of perfume” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
12:3	ki9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύρου	1	Here, **perfumed oil** refers to a liquid made from the oils of pleasant-smelling plants and flowers. This **oil** was put on a person’s skin or hair in order for that person to smell pleasant. If your readers would not be familiar with this **oil**, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “of scented liquid” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:3	qblr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	μύρου νάρδου πιστικῆς πολυτίμου	1	John is using **of** to describe **perfumed oil** that is made from **very precious pure nard**. If this use of the possessive **of** would be confusing in your language, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “of perfumed oil made from very precious pure nard” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
12:3	b3sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	νάρδου πιστικῆς πολυτίμου	1	The **perfumed oil** was made from the **oil** of a **nard** plant, which is sometimes called “spikenard.” The **oil** is extracted from the roots of this plant. If your readers would not be familiar with **nard** plants, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “of very precious scented plants” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
12:3	pq7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ δὲ οἰκία ἐπληρώθη ἐκ τῆς ὀσμῆς τοῦ μύρου	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Now the fragrance of the perfumed oil filled the house” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
12:4	frgx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ἰούδας ὁ Ἰσκαριώτης	1	**Judas** is the name of a man, and **Iscariot** is a distinguishing term that most likely means he came from the village of Kerioth. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
12:4	qbja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	λέγει	1	Here John uses the present tense in past narration in order to call attention to a development in the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
12:5	e8d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	διὰ τί τοῦτο τὸ μύρον οὐκ ἐπράθη τριακοσίων δηναρίων, καὶ ἐδόθη πτωχοῖς?	1	Judas is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize that he thought the **perfumed oil** should not be poured on Jesus. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation, and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “This perfume could have been sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
12:5	dx9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	δηναρίων	1	The word **denarii** is the plural form of “denarius.” It was a denomination of money in the Roman Empire that was equivalent to one days’ wages. Alternate translation: “for 300 days’ wages” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
12:5	tted		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πτωχοῖς	1	Judas is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “to people who are poor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
12:6	ri5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	In this verse John interrupts the story to explain why Judas made the statement in the previous verse. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
12:6	sl8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	εἶπεν & τοῦτο, οὐχ ὅτι περὶ τῶν πτωχῶν ἔμελεν αὐτῷ, ἀλλ’ ὅτι κλέπτης ἦν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “he said this because he was a thief, not because it was a concern to him about the poor” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
12:6	mgm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν πτωχῶν	1	See how you translated **the poor** in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
12:6	qoun		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ὅτι κλέπτης ἦν	1	John is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “but he said this because he was a thief” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
12:6	ol4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὰ βαλλόμενα	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:7	z6s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἄφες αὐτήν, ἵνα εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ ἐνταφιασμοῦ μου, τηρήσῃ αὐτό	1	This could mean: (1) Jesus is stating the purpose for which Mary did not sell the perfume. In this case he would be leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. This translation would require supplying those words from Judas’ objection in [verse 5](../12/05.md) and making a new sentence. Alternate translation: “Leave her alone. She did not sell this perfumed oil so that she might keep it for the day of my burial” (2) Jesus is giving the purpose for his command in the previous clause. In this case he would be implying that there was some leftover perfumed oil which Mary could later put on his dead body. Alternate translation: “Leave her alone so that she might keep it for the day of my burial” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
12:7	dcn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄφες αὐτήν, ἵνα εἰς τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ ἐνταφιασμοῦ μου, τηρήσῃ αὐτό	1	If Jesus is stating the reason why Mary had the perfume, then Jesus is implying that Mary’s actions can be understood as anticipating his death and **burial**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. You may need to add a new sentence. Alternate translation: “Leave her alone. She did not sell this perfumed oil so that she might keep it to prepare my body for burial, as she had just done” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:8	wo1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς πτωχοὺς γὰρ πάντοτε ἔχετε μεθ’ ἑαυτῶν, ἐμὲ δὲ οὐ πάντοτε ἔχετε	1	Jesus’ statement in this verse implies that Mary acted properly by pouring the expensive perfume on him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “She acted appropriately, because you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
12:8	r82p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς πτωχοὺς & πάντοτε ἔχετε μεθ’ ἑαυτῶν	1	Jesus implies that there will always be opportunities to help **the poor**.

12:13	nu7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ βαΐα τῶν φοινίκων	1	In that culture a **palm tree** branch was a symbol that represented the nation of Israel.

He speaks of the death of that **grain** to refer to his death, burial, and resurrection. He also uses **fruit** to refer to those people who will trust in him for salvation after his resurrection.

If this would confuse your readers, you could use a simile or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am like a grain of wheat. Unless that grain of wheat, having fallen into the earth, dies, it remains by itself; but if it would die, it bears much fruit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

13:intro	zk68				0	# John 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The Passover meal begins: Jesus washes his disciples’ feet (13:1–20)\n2. Jesus predicts that Judas will betray him (13:21–30)\n3. Jesus commands his disciples to love each other (13:31–35)\n4. Jesus predicts that Peter will deny him (13:36–38)\n\nThe events of this chapter are commonly referred to as the “Last Supper.” In many ways this Passover meal parallels the sacrifice of Jesus as the lamb of God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lordssupper]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The washing of feet\n\nPeople in the Ancient Near East thought that feet were very dirty. Only servants would wash people’s feet. The disciples did not want Jesus to wash their feet, because they considered him to be their master and themselves to be his servants, and it was a servant’s job to wash the feet of master and guests. However, Jesus wanted to show them that his disciples need to humbly serve and love each other. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])\n\n### I AM\n\nJohn records Jesus saying these words as an independent phrase one time in this chapter ([13:19](../13/19.md)). They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew expression “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses in [Exodus 3:14](../../exo/03/14.md). For these reasons many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “The disciple whom Jesus loved”\n\nThe Apostle John first referred to himself as the disciple “whom Jesus loved” in this chapter ([13:23](../13/23.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. If this is the case, then you will need to add a first person pronoun to these references and the other references to John in ([13:23–25](../13/23.md)). If your language can retain the third person references, then you may still want to make these references to John explicit by adding “John” next to them. See the discussion of this in Part 1 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/johntheapostle]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “Son of Man”\n\nJesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([13:31](../13/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. See the discussion of this concept in Part 3 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “he gets up from the table where he was eating supper” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
13:4	a9yt			τίθησιν τὰ ἱμάτια	1	Here, **outer clothing** refers to clothing that is worn over undergarments. It does not refer to a coat that would be worn over a person’s regular clothing. Use the term in your language for the regular clothing that people wear on top of their underwear.
13:4	gfe4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λαβὼν λέντιον	1	Here, **towel** refers to piece of cloth that is long enough to wrap around Jesus’ waist and still has enough leftover cloth to wipe the disciples’ feet.

He also uses **feet** figuratively to refer to daily sins, because people in Jesus’ culture had to wash their **feet** frequently due to wearing sandals while walking on dusty, dirty roads. If this might confuse your readers, you could state their meanings clearly or use similes. Alternate translation: “The one who has received God’s forgiveness for their sins, only needs to be forgiven for his daily sins” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The repetition is used to emphasize that Jesus’ disciples are not more important than him, so they should humbly serve each other. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “none of you are greater than me” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
13:16	k3zj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἔστιν δοῦλος μείζων τοῦ κυρίου αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus uses the words **slave** and **master** figuratively to refer to his disciples and himself, respectively.

Jesus also called him the Spirit of Truth ([14:17](../14/17.md)), who tells God’s people what is true about God so they know him better and serve him well. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])

The Jewish people were expecting the Messiah to come and reveal himself to the whole **world**, but Jesus said he would only show himself to his disciples.

15:intro	k9jd				0	# John 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus says he is the vine (15:1–8)\n2. Jesus commands his disciples to love each other (15:9–17)\n3. Jesus promises that his disciples will be persecuted (15:18–16:4)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Vine\n\nJesus used the vine as a metaphor for himself. The vine of the grape plant takes water and minerals from the ground and gives them to the leaves and grapes that are on the branches. Without the vine, the branches, grapes, and leaves die. He wanted his followers to know that unless they loved and obeyed him, they would be unable to do anything that pleased God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/vine]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/grape]], and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “Remain in me”\n\nJesus uses the word “remain” as a metaphor. He is speaking of a believer being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person “remained” in the other person. Christians are said to “remain” in Christ. The Son is said to “remain” in believers. Many translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. In ([15:7](../15/07.md)), the UST expresses this idea of “my words remain in you” as “obey what I have taught you.” Translators may find it possible to use this translation as a model.
15:1	aws2			Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThe part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus continues to speak to his disciples either at the end of their evening meal or after they have finished that meal and are walking to Gethsemane. It is unclear whether or not they left immediately after Jesus said “Let us go from here,” at the end of the previous chapter ([John 14:31](../14/31.md)).
15:1	fen5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγώ εἰμι ἡ ἄμπελος ἡ ἀληθινή	1	Jesus uses the **true vine** figuratively to refer to himself. As a **vine** is the source of life for its branches, so Jesus causes people to live in a way that pleases God and brings other people to believe in Jesus. Since the **vine** is an important metaphor in the Bible, you should translate the words directly or use a simile and not provide a non-figurative explanation in the text of your translation. Alternate translation: “I am like a true vine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:1	puzl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἡ ἀληθινή	1	The word translated **vine** refers specifically to the grapevine plant that produces grapes. If your readers would not be familiar with grapevines, use an equivalent word in your language for a **vine** that produces fruit. Alternate translation: “grapevine” or “fruit-producing vine” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
15:1	hqj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
15:1	w2d4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατήρ μου ὁ γεωργός ἐστιν	1	Jesus uses **farmer** figuratively to refer to God. Just as a **farmer** takes care of the**vine** to ensure it is as fruitful as possible, so God takes care of his people. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “my Father is like a gardener” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:1	t4ne			ὁ γεωργός	1	While **farmer** is a general term for anyone who farms the ground, in this context it refers to someone who takes care of grapevines and grows grapes. Alternate translation: “vine grower” or “grape farmer”
15:2	p311		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	πᾶν κλῆμα ἐν ἐμοὶ μὴ φέρον καρπὸν & καὶ πᾶν τὸ καρπὸν φέρον & ἵνα καρπὸν πλείονα φέρῃ	1	Jesus speaks about people who claim to be his disciples but are not by continuing the metaphor of a vine. In this paragraph, Jesus uses **branch** figuratively to refer to both true and false disciples. He also uses **bearing fruit**, **bears fruit**, and **bear more fruit** figuratively to refer to living in a manner that pleases God, especially demonstrating the Christian qualities called the “fruit of the Spirit” in [Galatians 5:22–23](../../gal/05/22.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this metaphor as a simile. Alternate translation: “Everyone who claims to be my disciple but does not please God is like a branch in me that does not bear fruit … and every person who pleases God is like a branch that bears fruit … so that he might be like a branch that bears more fruit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
15:2	wt8w			αἴρει αὐτό	1	Alternate translation: “he cuts it off of the vine and takes it away” or “he breaks it off of the vine and throws it away”
15:2	enrh			καθαίρει αὐτὸ	1	The word translated **prunes** could mean: (1) to remove excess parts from a plant. Alternate translation: “he trims it” (2) to cause something to become clean. Alternate translation: “he cleans it” (3) to remove excess parts from a plant in order to make it clean. See the discussion of John’s use of double meaning in Part 3 of the Introduction to this book. Alternate translation: “he prunes it so that it will be clean”
15:3	xn3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἤδη ὑμεῖς καθαροί ἐστε	1	The word translated **clean** is related to the word translated “prunes” in the previous verse. Here Jesus uses **clean** to imply that the branches have already been cleaned by pruning off the excess parts. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile. Alternate translation: “You are like branches that have already been pruned and are clean” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:3	ls0g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, **word** refers to the message or teachings of Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
15:3	l5zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμεῖς & ὑμῖν	1	The words **You** and **you** in this verse are plural and refer to the disciples of Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

15:5	b1qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποιεῖν οὐδέν	1	Here Jesus uses **do nothing** to refer to doing **nothing** that pleases God. It does not refer to doing **nothing** at all. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “do nothing that pleases God” or “do nothing acceptable to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
15:6	fgnm			ἐὰν μή τις μένῃ ἐν ἐμοί, ἐβλήθη ἔξω ὡς τὸ κλῆμα καὶ ἐξηράνθη, καὶ συνάγουσιν αὐτὰ καὶ εἰς τὸ πῦρ βάλλουσιν, καὶ καίεται	1	In the middle of this verse, Jesus changes from referring to the **branch** in a singular form to a plural form. If this change would be confusing in your language, you could change the singular forms into plural forms. Alternate translation: “If people do not remain in me, they are thrown outside like branches and are dried up, and they gather them into the fire, and they are burned up”
15:6	d5mt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μένῃ ἐν ἐμοί	1	See how you translated **remain in me** in the previous two verses. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

15:6	k1tm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ κλῆμα	1	Jesus uses **branch** figuratively to refer to someone who claims to be Jesus’ disciple, but is not. See how you translated the similar use of **branch** in [verse 2](../15/02.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
15:6	ura6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	καὶ συνάγουσιν αὐτὰ καὶ εἰς τὸ πῦρ βάλλουσιν, καὶ καίεται	1	The first **they** in this verse refers to an indefinite subject, but the second **they** refers to the object. If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate them differently. Alternate translation: “and some helpers gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned up” or “and someone gathers them and throws them into the fire, and those branches are burned up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
15:6	e789		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καίεται	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

15:7	m38f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὃ ἐὰν θέλητε, αἰτήσασθε	1	Jesus is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

15:7	mcz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γενήσεται ὑμῖν	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

15:8	pq2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ἐν τούτῳ ἐδοξάσθη ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	Jesus is figuratively using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If this is confusing in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: “My Father will be glorified in this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
15:8	yq67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν τούτῳ ἐδοξάσθη ὁ Πατήρ μου	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

16:intro	wb8v				0	# John 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus promises that his disciples will be persecuted (15:18–16:4)\n2. Jesus describes the work of the Holy Spirit (16:5–15)\n3. Jesus says that he will return to his Father (16:16–28)\n4. Jesus says that his disciples will soon abandon him (16:29–33)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Holy Spirit\n\nJesus told his disciples that he would send the Holy Spirit to them. The Holy Spirit is the Helper ([14:16](../14/16.md)) who is always with God’s people to help them and to speak to God for them. He is also the Spirit of Truth ([14:17](../14/17.md)) who tells God’s people what is true about God so they know him better and serve him well. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n### “The hour is coming”\n\nJesus used the words, “the hour is coming,” to begin prophecies about events that were about to occur. He is not referring to the 60 minute hour, but to a point in time when these prophecies will be fulfilled. “The hour” in which people would persecute his followers ([16:2](../16/02.md)) lasted for many years. However, “the hour” in which his disciples would scatter and leave him alone ([16:32](../16/32.md)) was less than sixty minutes long. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Simile\n\nJesus said that just as a woman is in pain when she gives birth to a baby, so also his followers would be sad when he died. But just as the woman is happy after the baby is born, so also his followers would be happy when Jesus became alive again. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
16:1	pbc8			Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThe part of the story from the previous chapter continues. Jesus continues to speak to his disciples either at the end of their evening meal or after they have finished that meal and are walking to Gethsemane. It is unclear whether or not they left immediately after Jesus said “Let us go from here” at the end of the Chapter 14 ([John 14:31](../14/31.md)).
16:1	hn4j			Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nVerses 1–4 are part of the same topic Jesus began in [15:18](../15/18.md). He is speaking about the persecution that his disciples will experience.

16:1	vui6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ σκανδαλισθῆτε	1	Here, Jesus uses **fall away** figuratively to refer to no longer trusting in him or no longer being his disciple.

17:intro	nb2a				0	# John 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is one long prayer that can be divided into three parts according to the topics of Jesus’ prayer requests:\n\n1. Jesus prays for himself (17:1–5)\n2. Jesus prays for his disciples (17:6–19)\n3. Jesus prays for all Christians (17:20–26)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Glory\n\nScripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, bright light that visually represents how great God is. When people see this light, they are afraid. In this chapter Jesus asks God to show his followers his true glory ([17:1](../17/01.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])\n\n### Jesus is eternal\n\nJesus existed before God created the world ([17:5](../17/05.md)). John wrote about this in [1:1](../01/01.md).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Prayer\n\nJesus is God’s one and only Son ([3:16](../03/16.md)), so he could pray differently from the way other people pray. He used many words that might seem to be commands. Your translation should make Jesus sound like a son speaking with love and respect to his father and telling him what the father needs to do so that the father will be honored.

18:intro	ltl2				0	# John 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Soldiers and guards arrest Jesus (18:1–11)\n2. The priests question Jesus, and Peter denies Jesus (18:12–27)\n3. Pilate questions Jesus (18:28–40)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death”\n\nThe Roman government did not allow the Jews to kill criminals, so the Jews needed to ask Pilate, the governor, to kill him ([18:31](../18/31.md)).\n\n### King of the Jews\n\nWhen Pilate asked if Jesus were the King of the Jews ([18:33](../18/33.md)), he was asking if Jesus were claiming to be a political leader like King Herod, whom the Romans allowed to rule Judea. When he asked the crowd if he should release the King of the Jews ([18:39](../18/39.md)), he is mocking the Jews, because the Romans and Jews hated each other. He was also mocking Jesus, because he did not think that Jesus was a king at all. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

One Roman official had appointed **Annas**, but ten years later another official deposed him and caused **Caiaphas** to be **high priest** instead. However, the Jews still considered Annas to be **high priest**. It would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible for your readers. Alternate translation: “first to the high priest Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the other high priest that year” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from his original statement in [11:50](../11/50.md).

He would later send Jesus to Caiaphas in [verse 24](../18/24.md). If this use of **high priest** might confuse your readers, you could state who the person is explicitly.

18:20	h2kj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ κόσμῳ	1	Here Jesus uses **the world** figuratively to refer to all of the people in the world.

18:20	ltlp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἐγὼ παρρησίᾳ λελάληκα τῷ κόσμῳ	1	Here, **to the world** is an exaggeration that Jesus uses to emphasize that he spoke publicly.

The Jewish leaders believed that they would become ceremonially unclean if they entered the house of someone who was not a Jew. If they became ceremonially unclean, then they would not be allowed to celebrate the Passover festival. Therefore, the Jewish leaders did not enter the governor’s palace. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this in the simplest way possible. Alternate translation: “they themselves did not enter into the governor’s palace because the governor was a Gentile.

18:34	liov		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ σεαυτοῦ	1	Here, **from** indicates the origin of Pilate’s question.

19:intro	u96u				0	# John 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Soldiers beat and mock Jesus (19:1–3)\n2. The Jewish leaders convince Pilate to crucify Jesus (19:4–16)\n3. Soldiers crucify Jesus (19:17–27)\n4. Jesus dies on the cross (19:28–37)\n5. Jesus’ friends put his body in a tomb (19:38–42)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text in order to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [19:24](../19/24.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Purple garment”\n\nPurple is a color that is from a mixture of red and blue. The soldiers mocked Jesus by putting a purple garment on him. This was because kings wore purple garments. They spoke and acted like they were giving honor to a king, but everyone knew that they were doing it because they hated Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### “You are not Caesar’s friend”\n\nPilate knew that Jesus was not a criminal, so he did not want to have his soldiers kill him. But the Jews told him that Jesus was claiming to be a king, and anyone who did that was breaking Caesar’s laws ([19:12](../19/12.md)).\n\n### Ancient Jewish burial customs\n\nAccording to the burial customs of that time, a dead person’s family would wrap the dead body with many strips of linen cloth and place it on a table inside a tomb. The tomb was either a cave or a room cut out of the side a large rock. According to Jewish tradition, the body was left to decompose in the tomb for one year. Then the family would then place the bones in a stone box. If your readers would be unfamiliar with these burial customs, then you may need to provide explanations in your translation or in a note for [verses 39–42](../19/39.md).\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([19:41](../19/41.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nThe soldiers were insulting Jesus when they said, “Hail, King of the Jews.” Pilate was insulting the Jews when he asked, “Should I crucify your king?” He was probably also insulting both Jesus and the Jews when he wrote, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Gabbatha, Golgotha\n\nJohn explained the meanings of these two Aramaic words (“The Pavement” and “The Place of a Skull”). Then he used Greek letters to express the sound of these words. You should also use the letters of your language to express the sounds of these Aramaic words.

19:38	xtva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωσὴφ ὁ ἀπὸ Ἁριμαθαίας	1	Since [Luke 23:50](../../luk/23/50.md) indicates that **Joseph** was a member of the Sanhedrin, he was likely dwelling in Jerusalem. Therefore, John would mean here that **Joseph** was originally **from Arimathea**. **Joseph** had not come **from Arimathea** to Jerusalem for this occasion. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Joseph, who was originally from Arimathea” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “who had met Jesus before when he visited him at night” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:39	ekyu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	φέρων μίγμα σμύρνης καὶ ἀλόης	1	According to the burial customs of Jesus’ time, people prepared this **mixture** in order to put it on Jesus’ body as a way to honor him and to counteract the smell of decay. If this would confuse your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes to put on Jesus’ body” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:39	d3d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σμύρνης καὶ ἀλόης	1	This **mixture of myrrh and aloes** consisted of pleasant-smelling substances that were mixed together into an ointment that was put on a dead body in order to counteract the smell of decay. If your readers would not be familiar with these substances, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “of pleasant-smelling substances” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
19:39	xks9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	ὡς λίτρας ἑκατόν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this weight in terms of modern measurements either in the text or a footnote. One **litra** is about one third of a kilogram or three quarters of a pound. Alternate translation: “about 33 kilograms in weight” or “weighing about thirty-three kilograms” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
19:40	m9k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἔδησαν αὐτὸ ὀθονίοις μετὰ τῶν ἀρωμάτων	1	Wrapping a dead body in strips of cloth was the burial custom in this culture. See the discussion of this in the General Notes for this chapter.

Alternate translation: “wrapped strips of linen cloth around his body and put spices under the strips of cloth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
19:41	fb25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background		0	In this verse John interrupts the main storyline in order to provide some background information about the location of the tomb where they would bury Jesus. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
19:41	uib1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἦν δὲ ἐν τῷ τόπῳ ὅπου ἐσταυρώθη κῆπος	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

19:41	bx6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδέπω οὐδεὶς ἦν τεθειμένος	1	The phrase **no one had yet** translates two negative words in Greek. John uses them together to emphasize that the tomb had never been used. If your language can use two negatives together for emphasis without them cancelling each other to create a positive meaning, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
19:42	nr4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	According to Jewish law, no one could work after sundown on **the day of preparation** because sundown marked the beginning of the Sabbath and Passover. This meant that they had to bury Jesus’ body quickly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because the Passover and Sabbath were about to begin that evening” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
19:42	c70e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐκεῖ & διὰ τὴν παρασκευὴν τῶν Ἰουδαίων, ὅτι ἐγγὺς ἦν τὸ μνημεῖον, ἔθηκαν τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “they laid Jesus there because of the day of preparation of the Jews and because the tomb was close by” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

19:42	jtfz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ἔθηκαν τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1	John is referring to putting Jesus’ dead body in a tomb as laying him down. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant, and it accurately describes the Jewish burial practice of laying a dead body on a table inside the tomb. See how you translated a similar expression in [11:34](../11/34.md). Alternate translation: “they entombed Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
20:intro	nm1y				0	# John 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Mary Magdalene, Peter, and John go to Jesus’ tomb and find it empty (20:1–10)\n2. Mary Magdalene meets Jesus (20:11–18)\n3. Ten disciples meet Jesus (20:19–25)\n4. Thomas meets Jesus (20:26–29)\n5. John states the purpose for this Gospel (20:30–31)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The tomb\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([20:1](../20/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was a room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could look inside or enter.\n\n### “Receive the Holy Spirit”\n\nIf your language uses the same word for “breath” and “spirit,” be sure that the reader understands that Jesus was performing a symbolic action by blowing air out of his mouth, and that Jesus was referring to the Holy Spirit, not his breath. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Rabboni\n\nJohn used Greek letters to express the sound of this Aramaic word. Then he explained that the word means “Teacher.” You should also use the letters of your language to express the sounds of the Aramaic word.\n\n### Jesus’ resurrection body\n\nWe do not know what Jesus’ body looked like after he became alive again. His disciples knew he was Jesus because they could see his face and touch the places where the soldiers had put the nails through his hands and feet and pierced his side. However, he could also walk through solid walls and doors and sometimes people didn’t recognize him. It is best not to say more than what the ULT says about Jesus’ resurrection body.\n\n### Two angels in white\n\nMatthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels appeared in human forms. Two of the Gospel authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT rather than trying to make the passages all state the exact same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))
20:1	a8vl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ & μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	John uses **first** to imply the **first** day of the week. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “on the first day of the week” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
20:1	sb4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	τῇ & μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων	1	Here John is actually using a cardinal number, “one,” to mean **first**. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can also use a cardinal number here in your translation. Alternate translation: “on day one of the week” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

20:2	xd3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	οὐκ οἴδαμεν ποῦ ἔθηκαν αὐτόν	1	When Mary says **we**, she is speaking of herself and some women who came to the tomb with her. These women are mentioned in [Matthew 28:1](../../mat/28/01.md); [Mark 16:1](../../mrk/16/01.md); and [Luke 24:1](../../luk/24/01.md), [10](../../luk/24/10.md), [24](../../luk/24/24.md). Since she is not speaking of the two disciples, **we** is exclusive. Your language may require you to mark this form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

21:intro	e1bg				0	# John 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus eats breakfast with his disciples (21:1–14)\n2. Jesus restores Peter as his disciple (21:15–19)\n3. Jesus and Peter speak about John (21:20–23)\n4. John concludes his Gospel (21:24–25)\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The metaphor of sheep\n\nBefore Jesus died, he spoke of himself taking care of his people as if he were a good shepherd taking care of sheep ([10:11](../10/11.md)). After he became alive again, Jesus commanded Peter to take care of other believers in the same way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “The disciple whom Jesus loved”\n\nThe apostle John referred to himself as the disciple “whom Jesus loved” twice in this chapter ([21:7](../21/07.md), [20](../21/20.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. If this is the case, then you will need to use a first person pronoun for these references and the other references to John throughout this chapter. You would also need to use first person plural pronouns in this chapter for all references to the disciples as a group, since John was one of them. If your language can retain the third person references, then you may want to make these references to John explicit by adding “John” next to them. See the discussion of this in Part 1 of the General Introduction to the Gospel of John. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/johntheapostle]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### Different words for “love”\n\nIn [verses 15–17](../21/15.md), Jesus and Peter speak to each other using two different words in the original language that could both be translated as “love.” These words are often used interchangeably. However, when they are used together, as in [verses 15–17](../21/15.md), they can have slightly different meanings. One word can refer to a type of love that is based on affection and friendship, but the other word can refer to a type of love that is based on sincere devotion and high esteem for the person being loved. Although the UST translates both of these words as “love,” the notes will provide more specific alternatives.

21:18	qltf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκτενεῖς τὰς χεῖράς σου	1	Here, **stretch out** means to extend one’s hands away from one’s sides.

Alternate translation: “We eyewitnesses of Jesus’ life know” (2) the elders in the church at Ephesus where John lived at the end of his life.
