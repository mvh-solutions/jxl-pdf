# Introduction to the UDB
The Unlocked Dynamic Bible (UDB) is intended to be used as a supplemental resource for Bible translation alongside the Unlocked Literal Bible (ULB). Its purpose is to unpack the meaning of figures of speech, idioms, abstract nouns, and difficult grammatical forms that occur in the ULB as a reflection of those things in the Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek texts. 

By using the UDB as a supplemental resource to the ULB, translators will be able to 1) see many of the figures of speech, idioms, and other forms of the original Bible in the ULB, and 2) then see what their meaning is in the UDB. Translators can use the forms from the ULB that are clear and natural in their language. When those forms are not clear or natural in their language, they can use the UDB and the translationNotes to help them choose other forms in their language that have the same meaning as the ULB.

The UDB is not meant to be a refined, polished English version. Because it  avoids figures of speech and idioms, it does not have the elegant or sophisticated language of an end-user Bible.
