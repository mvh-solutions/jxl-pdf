front:intro	jp2y				0	# Introduction to 1 Thessalonians\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of 1 Thessalonians\n\nIn this letter, the apostle Paul, along with Silvanus and Timothy, encourages and makes appeals to the Thessalonian church (See: rc://*/tw/bible/names/thessalonica.md). Paul is the spokesman for all of them, using “we” to refer to the group, but in certain places Paul speaks for himself using “I” (See [2:18](../02/18.md); [3:5](../03/05.md); [5:27](../05/27.md)). The background story for the apostles’ activity in Thessalonica can be found in Acts 17:1-10.\n\n1. Apostolic memories of the Thessalonian church (1:1-10)\n    * Greeting (1:1)\n    * Thanksgiving for the Thessalonian Christians (1:2-4)\n    * Examples of Thessalonian suffering (1:6-10)\n2. Apostolic authority (2:1-16)\n    * Persecution of the church (2:1-13)\n    * Opposition to the church (2:14-16)\n3. Timothy’s visit to Thessalonica (3:1-13)\n    * Reason for the visit (3:1-5)\n    * Report about the visit (3:6-13)\n4. Apostolic teachings (4:1-18)\n    * Holiness (4:1-8)\n    * Christian love (4:9-12)\n    * Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13-18)\n5. Final teachings (5:1-28)\n    * Timing of the Second Coming of Christ (5:1-10)\n    * Final appeals and teachings (5:11-28)\n\n### Who wrote 1 Thessalonians?\n\nPaul wrote 1 Thessalonians, writing with the agreement of Silvanus and Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Saul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, Paul traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth. Many scholars think 1 Thessalonians was the first letter Paul wrote of all Paul’s letters that are in the Bible.\n\nSilvanus is also mentioned in 2 Corinthians 1:19; 2 Thessalonians 1:1; 1 Peter 5:12. “Silas,” the name used in the book of Acts, is a contracted form of Silvanus; Silas and Silvanus are considered to be the same person. Timothy was leader of the church at Ephesus (See 1 Timothy 1:1-4). Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth with these two men. The mention of all three men in 1:1 indicates they were in Thessalonica together at some point.\n\n### What is the book of 1 Thessalonians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the church in the city of Thessalonica, after the Jews in the city forced him to leave. Ancient Thessalonica was located on the southeast coast of ancient Macedonia, and is now called Thessaloniki, located in northeast Greece. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background). In this letter Paul said he considered his visit to them a success, even though he was forced to leave (See Acts 17:1-10).\n\nPaul responded to the news from Timothy about the Thessalonian believers. The believers there were being persecuted. He encouraged them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also comforted them by explaining what happens to those who die before Christ returns.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Thessalonians” or “First Thessalonians.” They may instead prefer to choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Trinity\n\nIn this letter, the doctrine of the Holy Trinity finds solid support. The terms: God, Father, Son, Lord, Jesus, and Holy Spirit appear numerous times. (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/god]])\n\n### The gospel\n\nIn this letter, Paul frequently refers to the apostles’ ministry of the gospel and uses different phrases to communicate the concept of God’s good news about Jesus Christ. (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/goodnews]])\n\n### Prayer\n\nPaul reassures the Thessalonians that his group of apostles frequently prays for them (See [1:2](../01/02.md)). He also gives instructions about prayer (See [5:2](../05/02.md)), and asks the Thessalonians to pray for them (See [5:25](../05/25.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/pray]])\n\n### Faith and Faithfulness\n\nThrough the letter the Thessalonians are commended for their faithfulness to God. They are reminded to trust God and remain faithful to gospel living. (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/faithful]], [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Apostolic authority\n\nMuch of this letter is a defense of the apostles authority, based on their teaching and living. The term “apostles” is used in [2:6](../02/06.md)) to reinforce that Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy are sent by God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/apostle]])\n\n### Second Coming of Christ\n\nPaul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation, and there will be peace everywhere.\n\n### The fate of reposed Christians\n\nPaul made clear that those who die before Christ’s return will come back to life and be with Jesus. They will not remain dead forever. Paul wrote this to encourage the Thessalonians, for some of them worried that those Christians who died would miss the great “day of the Lord” when Jesus returns.\n\n### Idolatry\n\nThe Greek and Roman cultural background in Thessalonica meant that many members of the church were former pagans who practiced some sort of idolatry (See [1:9](../01/09.md)(See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/other/image]]).\n\n### Suffering\n\nMuch of this letter addresses both the sufferings of the apostles and the Thessalonian church for faithfulness to the gospel. (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/other/afflict]], [[rc://*/tw/bible/other/persecute]], [[rc://*/tw/bible/other/suffer]])\n\n### Sanctification\n\nThe concept of holiness is prevalent in this letter. Chapter four discusses how a Christian should practice a holy life. (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/sanctify]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in Christ Jesus” and “in the Lord Jesus Christ” and “in God the Father” and “in the Holy Spirit”?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a union between God and Christians that includes all three persons of the Trinity. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about these kinds of expressions.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “his coming” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ”?\n\nPaul used “coming” in a specific way in relation to Jesus Christ to refer to the time when he will come again to earth, this time displaying his glory and power and gathering his people to himself. Depending on the nuances of your language, you may need to translate this with a special concept or word.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “the word of God” or “the word of the Lord”?\n\nThroughout this letter, Paul uses these well-known phrases or abbreviations to refer to the gospel message.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “brothers”?\n\nThroughout this letter, “brothers” is a metaphor that refers to all believers, including females. (See [1:4](../01/04.md); 2:1, 9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 6, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12, 14, 26, 27)\n\n### “We” and “you”\n\nIn this letter, the words “we”, “us,” and “our” refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. In addition, “we”, “us,” and “our” are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n### Major textual issues in the text of the book of First Thessalonians\n\nWhen ancient manuscripts of the Bible differ, ULT puts in its text the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate, but it puts other possibly accurate readings in footnotes. The introductions to each chapter will discuss places where the ancient manuscripts differ in significant ways, and notes will address those places again where they occur in the book. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the readings found in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the readings in the ULT text. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants)\n* “Grace and peace to you” (See [1:1](../01/01.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”\n* “but we became little children in the midst of you, as if a mother might comfort her own children” (See [2:7](../02/07.md)). Some other manuscripts read, “Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.”\n* “Timothy, our brother and a servant of God” (See [3:2](../03/02.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	y8c5				0	# 1 Thessalonians 1 General Notes\n\n## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 1\n\n1. Greeting (1:1)\n2. Prayer of thanksgiving for the Thessalonian church (1:2-10)\n* Memory of the Thessalonians (1:2-5)\n    * apostolic prayers (1:2)\n    * work of the Thessalonians (1:2-3)\n    * God’s election of the Thessalonians (1:4-5)\n* Thessalonians’ example (1:6-10)\n    * reception of the apostles’ teaching (1:6)\n    * examples to Macedonia and Achaia (1:7-10)\n      * example of suffering (1:7)\n      * preaching of the gospel (1:8)\n      * turned away from idolatry to God (1:9)\n      * waiting for the Second Coming of Christ (1:10)\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nVerse 1 formally introduces this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type.\nVerses 2-4 give a general thanksgiving and encouragement to the Thessalonian church.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Trinity\n\nGod the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are mentioned numerous times in this chapter. They are described in their identity, activity, and the union that the Christian has in them.\n\n### Hardship\n\nLike the apostles before them, the Thessalonian church endured persecution for the sake of the gospel. The way that they responded with faith to the gospel message even in affliction and then preached that gospel to others made them examples to the churches throughout the regions of Macedonia and Achaia.\n\n### Faithfulness\n\nPaul mentions the faithfulness of the Thessalonian church throughout this chapter. See, for example, “work of faith” in 1:3, “example to all those who believe” in 1:7, and “faith toward God” in 1:8.
1:1	ms5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος; τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	Here some words are omitted that a sentence would need in order to be complete in many languages. Alternate translation: “We are Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, writing to the church” (See rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis)
1:1	zivb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος	1	Paul is understood to be the author of this letter. Silvanus and Timothy are with him as he writes and are in agreement with what he writes. If that might not be understood in your language, you could include this information in your translation. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, together with Silvanus and Timothy, write” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:1	r7n0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σιλουανὸς	1	The name **Silvanus** is a longer form of the name **Silas**, the form of the name used for this same man in the book of Acts. You could choose to use the shorter form here as well, or you could choose to use the longer form here and include a footnote explaining that they are forms of the same name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:1	z7wu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul speaks figuratively of the believers as though they were occupying space inside of God and Jesus. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to God and Jesus. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “sharing life with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:1	vlb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	When **God** is called **Father** (See [1:3](../01/03.md)), it is meant to highlight his relationship to **Jesus** as “Son” (See [1:10](../01/10.md)). Here, the Old Testament title for **God**, **Lord**, is applied to **Jesus**, equating him with **God**. Be sure to accurately translate these titles in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1:1	luw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	This phrase is a common biblical blessing formula and greeting (See Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:3; Eph. 1:2; Phil. 1:2; Col. 1:2; 2 Th. 1:2; Philem. 1:3; 1 Pet. 1:2; 2 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 1:4). Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing that could be used as a greeting in your language. Alternate translation: “May God give you his grace and peace” or “I pray that God shows you favor and keeps you safe” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1:1	qx70		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	The words **grace** and **peace** are abstract nouns. Your language may have a particular way of expressing these concepts, such as with verbs or description words. If so, you could use them in your translation. Alternate translation: “We pray that God will treat you kindly and give you peaceful relationships.” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1:1	nn67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	Throughout this letter the word **you** is plural and refers to the church of Thessalonica, unless otherwise noted. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you)
1:2	of3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	εὐχαριστοῦμεν & ποιούμενοι	1	In this verse Paul describes the apostles’ prayers for the Thessalonians in two clauses. The first clause is specific, that they **give thanks to God**, and the second is general, that they are **making mention** of them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of the clauses, as done in the UST. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
1:2	o7cp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε & μνείαν ποιούμενοι ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν ἡμῶν, ἀδιαλείπτως	1	Here the words **always** and **continually** are exaggerations that figuratively express the intensity and frequency of the prayers offered up to God by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy for the Thessalonians. If your language would not use exaggeration in this way, use plain language and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We regularly give thanks to God for all of you, very often making mention of you in our prayers” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole)
1:3	ecw0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μνημονεύοντες ὑμῶν τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τοῦ κόπου τῆς ἀγάπης, καὶ τῆς ὑπομονῆς τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν;	1	The main verb of this sentence is “we give thanks” (See [1:2](../01/02.md)). The phrase **remembering … before our God and Father** is an idiom that also means to thank God in prayer. The apostles are **remembering** these things about the Thessalonians and thanking God for them. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could move the phrase **before our God and Father** to follow **remembering**. Alternate translation: “offering thanks for … to our God and Father” or “gratefully mentioning to our God and Father … Christ” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom)
1:3	w769		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τοῦ κόπου τῆς ἀγάπης, καὶ τῆς ὑπομονῆς τῆς ἐλπίδος	1	Paul uses three pairs of words in a possessive relationship here. The most likely meaning of this possessive relationship is that the second word of each pair is the motivation for the first word of the pair. Alternate translation: “work motivated by faith and labor because of love and endurance based on future promises” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession)
1:3	kr8q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	The words **in our Lord Jesus Christ** is a possessive form. The relationship between **our Lord Jesus Christ** and **hope** could refer to: (1) Jesus as the object of hope. Alternate translation: “that our Lord Jesus Christ will do what he has promised” (2) Jesus as the source of hope. Alternate translation: “that comes from our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession)
1:3	tvrg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1	Here, **our God and Father** refers to the one divine person who is both God and Father. This phrase is a hendiadys, since Father further describes God. Alternate translation: “God our Father” or “our Father God” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys)
1:3	v01e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	Here, **our** refers to Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, and the Thessalonian church. All believers are the spiritual children of God the Father through Jesus. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive)
1:4	psc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	εἰδότες	1	Here, **knowing** continues the simultaneous description of how the writers of this letter “give thanks” (See UST). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1:4	qx5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀδελφοὶ ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This phrase acts as nominal adjective that describes the Thessalonian church in relational terms. They are spiritual siblings in their relationship with the writers of the letter and beloved children in their relationship with **God** the Father (See [1:3](../01/03.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:4	erb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοὶ	1	Throughout this letter, **brothers** is a metaphor meaning “fellow Christians” or “fellow believers in Christ.” If your readers would not understand what **brothers** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:4	egkq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοὶ	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or “spiritual brothers and sisters” or “fellow believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1:4	j08t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	If it is clearer in your language, this passive form **loved** could be changed to an active form. Alternate translation: “whom God has always loved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1:4	t70n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν	1	This phrase **your election** is the direct objective of **knowing**, and it is the beginning of a result clause. The reason why the writers of this letter know that the Thessalonians have been chosen as God’s people is found in the following verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:4	ohtl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν,	1	Here, **election** is an abstract noun phrase. If this is unclear in your language, you could change this abstract noun to a verb form. Alternate translation: “that he chose you to belong to him,” or “that he ordained you to be his children,” or starting a new sentence, “God selected you to be his people.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:5	jxfs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, **because** is the marker of a result clause. The writers of this letter are certain of the “election” and identity of the Thessalonian church as God’s people [1:4](../01/04.md), **because** they received the gospel message in all the ways described in verse 5. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1:5	ude4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγενήθη εἰς ὑμᾶς ἐν λόγῳ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	The writers of this letter use a contrasting clause to emphasize the multi-faceted effect of the gospel. Alternate translation: “our gospel preaching did not come to you as only a simple message, but even accompanied with power and the Holy Spirit and full assurance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1:5	sm4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγενήθη εἰς ὑμᾶς ἐν λόγῳ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	If it is clearer in your language, you could change this extended phrase to a simultaneous clause, framed in a positive way. Alternate translation: “our gospel message was completely validated: by our words, by a display of power, by the Holy Spirit, by your own full assurance” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1:5	h675			ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1	This phrase could refer to: (1) the **Holy Spirit** who gave the apostles the ability to preach the **gospel** powerfully. (2) the **Holy Spirit** who caused the preaching of the **gospel** to have a powerful effect in the Thessalonian church. Alternate translation: “but also empowered by the Holy Spirit” (3) the **Holy Spirit** demonstrated the truth of the **gospel** preaching through displays of **power**. Alternate translation: “but also with powerful signs from the Holy Spirit”
1:5	t1w3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	Here, **assurance** is an abstract noun. If your language does not use the abstract noun **assurance**, you can express the idea behind it in another way. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit gave you full confidence” or “the Holy Spirit fully convinced you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:5	wdr7			καθὼς οἴδατε οἷοι	1	The phrase **just as you know what kind of men** is used by writers of this letter to validate the gospel message, by the example of their own conduct amongst the Thessalonian Church. Alternate translation: “you even experienced for yourself what type of men” or “you are well aware how we behaved while”
1:6	cs49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ὑμεῖς μιμηταὶ ἡμῶν ἐγενήθητε καὶ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	If your language would not use a noun for the idea behind **imitators**, you could translate this with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “And all of you mimicked us and the Lord” or “And all of you copied us and the Lord” or “And all of you behaved like us and the Lord” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1:6	kgjr			ὑμεῖς	1	The word translated **you** is in a position that gives it special emphasis as a new topic. Use a natural way in your language to show that Paul is now going to talk about the Thessalonians. Alternate translation: “on your part, you” or “you yourselves”
1:6	b607		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῦ Κυρίου	1	**Lord** here refers to Jesus, as in [1:3](../01/03.md). Throughout this letter, whenever Paul uses the title **Lord**, it refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include the name here. See the UST. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
1:6	w222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	If it is natural in your language, you may want to indicate a contrast between this phrase and the one before it. Alternate translation: “yet in spite of that, you had joy from the Holy Spirit” or “and even so, the Holy Spirit caused you to be joyful” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast)
1:6	c2hl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	Here, **the word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. It refers to the same message called “our gospel” in [1:5](../01/05.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the gospel message” or “God’s message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:6	wura		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν θλίψει πολλῇ	1	If your language would not use the abstract noun **hardship**, you could express the idea behind it with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “while you were deeply distressed” or “as people made you suffer” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1:6	r7o6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	If your language would not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **joy**, you could translate this with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “you rejoiced because of the Holy Spirit” or “but remaining joyful because of the Holy Spirit” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1:6	ohen		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe a relationship between **the Holy Spirit** and **joy**. This relationship could be: (1) the Holy Spirit is the source of joy. Alternate translation: “with joy from the Holy Spirit” or “as the Holy Spirit caused you to rejoice” (2) joy is the response to having the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “with the joy of those who belong to the Holy Spirit” or “with joy because you belong to the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1:7	lwbm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	**As a result** indicates that what was spoken about in verse 6 caused what follows in verse 7. Use a natural way in your language to introduce verse 7 as the outcome of verse 6. Alternate translation: “Therefore” or “Because of that” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result)
1:7	et1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	γενέσθαι ὑμᾶς τύπους πᾶσιν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν ἐν τῇ Μακεδονίᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἀχαΐᾳ	1	If your language would not use the abstract noun **example**, you could express the idea behind it with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia wanted to imitate you” or “all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia started to copy how you live” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1:7	j1oz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοῖς πιστεύουσιν	1	Here and throughout the letter, the phrase **those who believe** refers to people who believe or trust in Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include that information here. Alternate translation: “to … those who trust in Jesus” or “to … those who remain faithful to Jesus” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)

Alternate translation: “This is why we have no reason to say anything more” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result)

1:9	rd2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ γὰρ περὶ ἡμῶν ἀπαγγέλλουσιν	1	The writers of the letter use the pronoun **themselves** to emphasize at least two things: (1) These are the same people who heard about the Thessalonians’ gospel message and way of life. (2) The way the writers of this letter know that the Thessalonians’ gospel message and way of life has spread “into every place” is from the **report**.

1:9	v145		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁποίαν εἴσοδον ἔσχομεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun **reception**, you can express that idea behind it in another way. Alternate translation: “how readily you received us” or “how enthusiastically you welcomed us” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1:9	xeff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁποίαν εἴσοδον ἔσχομεν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Paul implies that the **kind of reception** they had from the Thessalonians was a good one.

Alternate translation: “what a good reception we had from you” or “how gladly you welcomed us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1:9	dkv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πῶς ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν	1	Here, the phrase **how you turned** is an idiom that simply refers to the fact that they turned, not to the manner of how they turned. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “that you turned” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1:9	wpbm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων, δουλεύειν Θεῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could combine the two phrases **to God** and **to serve the living and true God** into one phrase.

1:9	u1um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the Thessalonian believers as if they had been facing toward their idols and then turned around to face toward God. He means that they no longer worship idols, but now they worship God. If this metaphor might be misunderstood in your language, use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “you started worshiping God and left the idols behind” or “you abandoned the idols so that you could worship God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:9	fa47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	δουλεύειν	1	Here, **to serve** introduces a purpose clause.

1:9	gv76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων, δουλεύειν Θεῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ	1	This phrase expresses parallelism, by contrasting the deadness and falseness of idols with the living and real God. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1:9	ou5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων, δουλεύειν Θεῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ	1	By using the terms **living and true** to describe God, Paul is implying that these terms do not apply to the idols or to the gods that those idols represent. The idols themselves are made of materials that are not alive. The gods that they represent are living beings, but they are not **true** gods, because people do not owe them obedience or worship as they do to the God who created them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include this information in the text or a footnote. Alternate translation: “from worshiping the non-living statues of false gods in order to serve the real God who is alive” or “from the dead idols in order to serve the God who lives and deserves our worship” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
1:10	wkt5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	καὶ ἀναμένειν τὸν Υἱὸν αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν	1	The phrase **and to wait** adds a second purpose for which the Thessalonian believers stopped worshiping idols. Use a natural method for connecting this as another purpose clause in your language. Alternate translation: “and also to wait expectantly for the second coming of his Son from heaven” (See the Introduction to 1 Thessalonians, Part 2, for a discussion of the Second Coming of Christ.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1:10	og49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τὸν Υἱὸν αὐτοῦ	1	**Son** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship to God the Father. Alternate translation: “God’s only Son” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples)
1:10	wil8			ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν	1	Here, the phrase **from the heavens** expresses the spiritual place where God is and where Jesus is currently located. It is the place from where he will return to the physical location of Earth. Make sure that your translation means this and not merely “the sky.” Alternate translation: “from the place where God is” or “from God’s realm”
1:10	pmi8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃν ἤγειρεν ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν, Ἰησοῦν,	1	Here, **whom** is a reference to **Son**, who is the same person as Jesus. Also, **he** and **his** refer back to God in [1:9](../01/09.md). So, it is God who raised Jesus from the dead. You can make the subject, God, explicit in your translation if the use of the pronoun is unclear in your language. Alternate translation: “Jesus, whom God raised from the dead” or “whom God resurrected from the dead. This is Jesus” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns)
1:10	ffro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Here, the phrase **the dead** is plural and a common biblical concept that refers to “dead people.” It means that Jesus physically died and was buried.

1:10	dbcl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	Ἰησοῦν, τὸν ῥυόμενον ἡμᾶς	1	The clause **the one rescuing us** is functioning as an adjective that describes Jesus in his role as rescuer. It makes this action of rescuing to be a characteristic of Jesus or even a title: “the rescuer.” Translate this in a way that makes this a description of Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus, our rescuer” or “Jesus, who rescues us” or “Jesus, the one who is going to rescue us” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish)
1:10	yh5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ῥυόμενον	1	Here, **rescuing** does not mean being taken away from God’s wrath after experiencing it. Instead, it means being taken away from any danger of experiencing God’s wrath. Alternate translation: “the one saving us” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
1:10	pt1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	This is an inclusive use of **us**, including Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, and the Thessalonians–and by extension—all Christians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “all of us Christians” or “we who trust in Christ” or “all of us believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

If it is clearer in your language, you could translate this as a verb form. Alternate translation: “from the future time when God punishes those who do not trust in him” or “when God will certainly punish those who worship idols” or “from God’s impending judgment” (See: [What is the “second coming” of Jesus?](../front/intro)) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1:10	cx5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῆς ὀργῆς τῆς ἐρχομένης	1	Paul speaks figuratively of **wrath** as though it were something that could travel and is **coming** to where people are. He means by this that in the future an event will happen when God will act wrathfully against people who have sinned and who have not trusted in Jesus to forgive their sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s judgment that will happen” or “when God will punish people for sin” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:intro	kt5l				0	# 1 Thessalonians 2 General Notes\n\n## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 2\n\n1. Apostolic Suffering (2:1-13)\n* Apostolic preaching (2:1-6)\n* Apostolic conduct (2:7-9)\n* Apostolic witness (2:10-3)\n2. Persecution of the Church (2:14-16)\n* Thessalonian persecution (2:14a)\n* Jewish persecution (2:14b-16)\n3. Paul’s Desire to Visit (2:17-20)\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe first part of this chapter is a defense of their apostleship and sufferings. The second part is a recounting of the Thessalonian church’s sufferings. Lastly, the apostle Paul makes known his deep desire to visit the Thessalonian church.\n\n## “We” and “You”\n\nIn this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** is used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Apostolic witness\n\nHere, Paul defends how he, Silvanus, and Timothy are God’s apostles. By their preaching, conduct, and witness, they prove to be authorized messengers of Christ. (See: [[rc://*/tw/bible/kt/apostle]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])\n\n### The gospel of God\n\nThe foundation of the apostolic witness is that they were “entrusted with the gospel” (See [2:4](../02/04.md)).The apostles’ authority makes them: “bold to speak” (See [2:2](../02/02.md)), “impart” (See [2:8](../02/08.md)), “preach” (See [2:9](../02/09.md)), and thank God that the Thessalonian church “received the word of God” (See [2:13](../02/13.md)).\n\n### The Second Coming of Christ\n\nIn this chapter is the first mention of the Second Coming of Christ in its two facets. First, Paul mentions that the persecutors of Christ’s Church will be judged by using the phrase “wrath has come upon them” in [2:16](../02/16.md). Next, Paul speaks of the “hope” and “joy” and “glory” for those who will “be saved” (See [2:16](../02/16.md)) “in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming” (See [2:19-20](../02/19.md)).

If your readers would not understand what **brothers** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:1	r14z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females.

2:1	nwlt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν εἴσοδον ἡμῶν τὴν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	This is an abstract noun phrase that refers to the apostles’ previous visit (See “reception” in [1:9](../01/09.md)).

Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “not to flatter people, but to please God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:4	bq9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν	1	The phrase **our hearts** is a metonym for the apostles’ motives, affections, or deepest thoughts.

This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” You can use a form in your language to list things that someone should not do. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
2:5	hqih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὔτε γάρ ποτε ἐν λόγῳ κολακίας ἐγενήθημεν,	1	Paul places **just as you know** in a position that gives it special emphasis (See also [2:2](../02/02.md)). If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “As you are well aware, we did not previously come to flatter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
2:5	q2yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν προφάσει πλεονεξίας	1	Here, **pretext** figuratively expresses the idea of people with greedy motives by comparing them to people wearing a mask or a disguise to cover up their evil intent. If the concept of a masking or disguising would not communicate a covering of true motives, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “disguising greedy intent” or “trying to hide greed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:5	qqia		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	(Θεὸς μάρτυς)	1	In the phrase **God {is} witness**, Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “God is our witness!”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:5	lfym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	(Θεὸς μάρτυς)	1	The apostles are appealing to God to validate their gospel message and personal motives. They figuratively speak as if they are summoning God as a witness to testify on their behalf before a judge. If your readers would not understand what **God {is} witness** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “We swear to/by God!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:6	j6c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	οὔτε ζητοῦντες ἐξ ἀνθρώπων δόξαν, οὔτε ἀφ’ ὑμῶν, οὔτε ἀπ’ ἄλλων	1	Here Paul refers figuratively to **men** to speak of any individual person. He also refers to **from you or from others** as another way of saying “all people.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “We were not looking for praise from any human being–not you or anyone else–” or “We were not hoping for any human honors from anyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:6	afcc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ἀνθρώπων δόξαν	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun **glory**, you can express the idea behind it in another way. Alternate translation: “for people to praise us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:7	u7y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	δυνάμενοι ἐν βάρει εἶναι, ὡς Χριστοῦ ἀπόστολοι	1	With the phrase **being able to be a burden**, Paul uses a hypothetical condition to draw attention to the divine authority of the **apostles of Christ**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. This phrase could refer to: (1) authority of the apostles. “as Christ’s apostles we have authority to force obedience” (2) rights of the apostles. Alternate translation: “as Christ’s apostles, we could have burdened you by demanding financial support” (3) authority and rights of the apostles. Alternate translation: “as Christ’s apostles, we have the power to demand support and submission” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
2:7	a75z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δυνάμενοι ἐν βάρει εἶναι	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the apostles as if they were a heavy weight or pack. He means that if they wanted to, they could impose their apostolic authority in a way that could seem oppressive to the Thessalonian church. If your readers would not understand what **burden** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “although we could impose our authority” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	bslq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, **but** signals that the rest of the verse will contrast the idea of **burden**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “however” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:7	y3bi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγενήθημεν νήπιοι ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν	1	Here, **became little children in the midst of you** is a metaphor indicating how gently the apostles treated the Thessalonian church. You could translate this with an active form, using a simile. Alternate translation: “we acted as mild as infants when we visited you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:7	bnp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν	1	Paul uses the idiom **in the midst of you** that means “spending time” or “visiting”. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “while visiting you” or “while spending time with you” or “when we were with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:7	ag1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἐὰν τροφὸς θάλπῃ τὰ ἑαυτῆς τέκνα	1	The point of this comparison is that in the same way a **mother** would gently **comfort** her **children**, so the apostles gently and affectionately nurtured the Thessalonian church (See [2:8](../02/08.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “as we affectionately cared for you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:8	r8b4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οὕτως ὁμειρόμενοι ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun **affection**, you can express the idea behind it in another way. Alternate translation: “Because we desire you so much” or “Since we yearn for you like this” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
2:8	q86v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὰς ἑαυτῶν ψυχάς	1	Paul uses **our own souls** to speak figuratively of the apostles’ bodies or their life. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “our own selves” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:9	v837		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1	Here the connecting word **For** emphasizes that what follows is something else important that the Thessalonian church should pay attention to. Alternate translation: “Certainly,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:9	exw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or “spiritual brothers and sisters” or “fellow believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:9	tc98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τὸν κόπον ἡμῶν καὶ τὸν μόχθον	1	Here, **labor** and **toil** mean basically the same thing. The repetition emphasizes how hard the apostles worked. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases or make them active. Alternate translation: “our toilsome labor” or “how hard we worked” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
2:9	ilj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας ἐργαζόμενοι	1	This phrase further explains **our labor and toil**. If this is not understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases more clear. Alternate translation: “although working night and day” or “despite the fact that we kept working night and day” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
2:9	ylkl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας ἐργαζόμενοι	1	Here, **night and day working** is an idiom for excessive labor. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “we stayed busy working” or “we never stopped laboring” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
2:9	kedf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἐπιβαρῆσαί τινα ὑμῶν	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the apostles as if they were a heavy weight or pack (See note at [2:7](../02/07.md)). Alternative translation, “so that none of you would have to financially support us” or “so that we would not impose on anyone” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:9	tw00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	πρὸς τὸ μὴ	1	This phrase introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why the apostles worked so much. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:9	ezqn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Again, the phrase **the gospel of God** is used to indicate that the apostles’ message is of divine origin (See your translation at [2:2](../02/02.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:10	re18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς μάρτυρες καὶ ὁ Θεός	1	The apostles are appealing to the Thessalonian church and God to validate their gospel message and personal motives (See also [2:5](../02/05.md)). They figuratively speak as if they are summoning both the church and God as a witness to testify on their behalf before a judge. If your readers would not understand what this phrase means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “You are our witnesses, as well as God himself” or “As well as God, you could personally testify” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:10	h52a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὑμεῖς μάρτυρες καὶ ὁ Θεός	1	In this phrase, Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “As well as God, you could personally testify” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:10	il3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	ὡς ὁσίως, καὶ δικαίως, καὶ ἀμέμπτως, ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν ἐγενήθημεν	1	Paul uses a repetitive series of proofs of the apostles’ godly behavior in [2:10-12](../02/10.md). This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” This is a list of the evidence for which the Thessalonian church and God are evoked as witnesses. Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone has done right. Alternate translation: “just how faithfully and justly and innocently we conducted ourselves toward you believers in God” or “how we acted reverently, and fairly, and blamelessly while visiting the faithful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
2:10	ufdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμεῖς & ὑμῖν	1	The pronouns **You** and **you** are plural and refer to all the believers in God at Thessalonica. Your language may require you to mark this form. Alternate translation: “You all … among all of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2:11	oug6			καθάπερ οἴδατε ὡς ἕνα ἕκαστον ὑμῶν	1	Again, Paul places **just as you know** in a position that gives it special emphasis (See also [2:2,5](../02/02.md)). It is another way of saying “you {are} witnesses” (See [2:10](../02/10.md)). Paul is appealing to the Thessalonian church’s own experience of the apostles’ godly behavior to prove their gospel message comes from God (See [2:9](../02/09.md)). Use a natural way in your language to express this emphasis. Alternate translation: “just as you each and every one of you are well aware” or “just as each one of you experienced for yourself”
2:11	i58m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς πατὴρ τέκνα ἑαυτοῦ	1	The point of Paul’s comparison is that the apostles are like fathers who model and instruct in proper behavior for their children. They see themselves as spiritual fathers to the Thessalonian church, so they nurture them in the Christian faith like a father would care for the overall well-being of his own children. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “like a father nurtures his own children” or “just as a father cares for his own children” or “like a father trains his own children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
2:12	m91e			παρακαλοῦντες ὑμᾶς, καὶ παραμυθούμενοι, καὶ μαρτυρόμενοι & ὑμᾶς	1	Paul uses a repetitive series of verb forms to show how the apostles have instructed the Thessalonian church like caring fathers would teach their children. These words are meant to instill a sense of urgency. Alternate translation: “encouraging and building you up and acting as your witness” or “instructing you through appeals, encouragement, and our own personal example”
2:12	clhg			παρακαλοῦντες & μαρτυρόμενοι	1	These verbal forms also describe the apostles’ fatherly behavior toward the Thessalonian church. These forms can be expressed in a number of ways: (1) result. Alternate translation: “with the result that we kept exhorting … testifying” (2) means. Alternate translation: “by exhorting … testifying” (3) manner. Alternate translation: “how we kept exhorting … testifying”
2:12	afop		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν ὑμᾶς ἀξίως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	This phrase is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for the apostles’ appeals. He wants the Thessalonian church to live **worthy of God**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “that you must honor God by how you live” or “so that you would live how God desires” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:12	go6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν ὑμᾶς ἀξίως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul is using the possessive form **of God** to describe how God’s people should live. Use a natural way in your language to make this explicit. Alternate translation: “to live in a way that honors God” or “to live in a way that God honors” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:12	udek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν	1	Here, **to walk** is a metaphor that means “to live.” If your readers would not understand what it means **to walk** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “to habitually live” or “for you to continue to live” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:12	v9ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς	1	This phrase gives us further information about God and describes what he is doing through the apostles’ teachings. If this is not understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “he is the one who continues to summon you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
2:12	b0by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς	1	Here, **who is calling you** is a parallelism that equates the apostles’ **exhorting**, **encouraging**, and **testifying** with God’s **calling**. See also [2:13](../02/13.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
2:12	vbd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ βασιλείαν καὶ δόξαν	1	This phrase, **into his own kingdom and glory**, expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **glory** describes what the **kingdom** is like. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “into his own glorious kingdom” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
2:13	au3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἡμεῖς εὐχαριστοῦμεν τῷ Θεῷ ἀδιαλείπτως	1	# General Information:\n\nThe phrase **And because of this** indicates that what follows are the reasons why the apostles are thankful for the Thessalonian church. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, as in the UST, to make this explicit. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:13	zja7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	καὶ ἡμεῖς εὐχαριστοῦμεν τῷ Θεῷ ἀδιαλείπτως	1	This phrase uses exaggeration to emphasize the apostles’ gratitude (See also [1:2](../01/02.md)). Here, **constantly** does not mean “every moment.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows intense gratitude. Alternate translation: “We ourselves habitually thank” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
2:13	ruy0			ἡμεῖς	1	Here Paul uses the word **we** to emphasize how thankful the apostles are. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we personally” or “we ourselves”
2:13	ei3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ὅτι παραλαβόντες λόγον ἀκοῆς παρ’ ἡμῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐδέξασθε	1	# General Information:\n\nThis clause explains why the apostles are thankful. If this is not understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases more clear. See UST (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
2:13	i39s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	ὅτι παραλαβόντες λόγον ἀκοῆς παρ’ ἡμῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐδέξασθε	1	# General Information:\n\nPaul is stressing that it is **the word of God** that the apostles reported. This is why he first mentions that the Thessalonians **received the word of God** before mentioning that they **heard** it. If this is confusing in your language, you can make the order of events clear. Alternate translation: “that when we told you God’s message, you heard it, and then you accepted it” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
2:13	dr6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, **that** marks the reasons in [2:13-14](../02/13.md) for why the apostles are thankful for the Thessalonian church. Use a natural way in your language to express the reason why people should do things. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:13	zj5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ καθὼς ἀληθῶς ἐστὶν	1	Paul uses this contrasting clause to strongly negate the idea that the apostles’ message is of human origin. Use a natural way in your language for introducing an emphatic contrast. Alternate translation: “but in fact what it really is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
2:13	f6ta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγον ἀνθρώπων & λόγον Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses the phrase **the word** figuratively to represent a message that is made up of words. Here, **the word of man** refers to a message of human origin. In contrast, **the word of God** refers to the same message, called “the gospel of God” in [2:8-9](../02/08.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “a human message … God’s message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
2:13	ci1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὃς καὶ ἐνεργεῖται ἐν ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν	1	The apostles refer to God’s gospel message figuratively as if it were a person or tool doing work. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “and God is energizing you faithful ones with this message” or “and God is activating this message among you who trust in him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
2:13	z89g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃς	1	Here, the word translated **which** could refer to **God** or **the word**. Alternate translation: “and God” or “and God’s word” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
2:13	x7oi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Here, the pronoun **you** is plural and refers to all the believers in God at Thessalonica (See [2:10](../02/10.md)). Your language may require you to mark this form. Alternate translation: “among all of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2:14	mh8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	became imitators of the churches	0	Verses 14-16 provide background information about how the Thessalonian church suffered persecutions similar to the Judean church. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
2:14	xopt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	**For** indicates that what follows is the proof of how God’s message is working among the Thessalonian church. Alternate translation: “Because” or “In fact” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
2:14	cj05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or “spiritual brothers and sisters” or “fellow believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:14	ij9j			μιμηταὶ ἐγενήθητε & τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν	1	Here, **imitators** is a noun that can be translated with a verb (See [1:6](../01/06.md)). Use a natural way in your language to express this idea. Alternate translation: “mimicked the churches” or “imitated the churches” or “copied the behavior of the churches”
2:14	g0t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, Paul speaks figuratively of the churches of God **in Christ Jesus** as though they were occupying space inside Jesus. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to God and Jesus (See also [1:1](../01/01.md)). Here, it also highlights the communion that Thessalonian believers **in Christ Jesus** have with Judean believers **in Christ Jesus** through the Holy Trinity. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “who are united to Jesus Christ” or “who share life with Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
2:15	a6xd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	τῶν καὶ τὸν Κύριον ἀποκτεινάντων Ἰησοῦν, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐκδιωξάντων	1	This is the specific content of the background information about the Jewish persecution of Christians. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
2:15	ucaz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	τῶν καὶ τὸν Κύριον ἀποκτεινάντων Ἰησοῦν, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐκδιωξάντων	1	This list of those persecuted by the Jews is not chronological, but emphasizes the order of importance and intensity of persecution. If this is confusing in your language, you can make the order of events clear. Alternate translation: “who have killed the prophets, then the Lord Jesus, and finally persecuted us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
2:15	ihh7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἡμᾶς ἐκδιωξάντων; καὶ Θεῷ μὴ ἀρεσκόντων, καὶ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων	1	Here, **and** indicates that the following phrase is the result of Jews’ persecution. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. To emphasize God’s response toward the Jews’ persecution, you could begin a new sentence with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “have persecuted us and are enemies of all people. This is why God is continually displeased” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
2:15	tfc4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	καὶ Θεῷ μὴ ἀρεσκόντων, καὶ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων,	1	These two phrases mean similar things. These phrases are meant to express how the Jewish persecution of Christians is the same thing as opposing God himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one clarifying idea. Alternate translation: “and they make themselves enemies of God by how hostile they are against the Jewish and Gentile churches” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
2:15	g6q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων,	1	Paul is using the possessive form of **hostile** to describe how the persecutors of the Christian Church are characterized by a hostile attitude. Alternate translation: “characterized by being opposed to all people types” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
2:15	dmxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐναντίων	1	A word is left out here in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, the word **are** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “are opposed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:15	u6ko		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις	1	Paul speaks figuratively about **all men** to refer to “all people types” or “the whole human race.” Here, **all men** refers to two parts of humanity represented by Jews (See [2:14](../02/14.md)) and Gentiles (See [2:16](../02/16.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “to all people types” or “to all the nations” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
2:15	ywwr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις	1	Here, **to all men** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express his emotions about the hostile Jews. Paul does not mean that the Jews are hostile to every individual human being. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows this emphasis.

2:15	vfyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both **men** and women. Alternate translation: “to all humans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
2:16	u012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	κωλυόντων ἡμᾶς τοῖς ἔθνεσιν λαλῆσαι, ἵνα σωθῶσιν	1	This clause gives further information for why the Gentiles are “not pleasing to God and {are} hostile to all men” (See [2:15](../02/15.md)).

2:16	r5fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα σωθῶσιν	1	This purpose clause gives the reason why the Jews are trying to prevent the apostles from preaching the gospel to the Gentiles. Here, **to speak** expresses the way the Gentiles **might be saved.** This clause could refer to: (1) the Jews purposely trying to keep the Gentiles from salvation. Alternate translation: “to hinder the Gentiles from being saved” (2) how the speaking is for the purpose of saving the Gentiles. Alternate translation: “in order that the Gentiles can be saved” or “for the purpose of saving the nations” The clause could also refer to both ideas. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
2:16	n2ue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ ἀναπληρῶσαι αὐτῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας πάντοτε	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the Jews’ sins as if they fill a container. He means that these Jews sin so much and so extremely that they can never escape God’s **wrath**.

Paul is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If the use of the past tense here is confusing in your language, you could use the future tense. This phrase could refer to: (1) final judgment. Alternate translation: “In fact, final wrath will overtake them” (See also [5:9](../05/09.md)) (2) certain judgment. Alternate translation: “Certainly, their punishment has finally arrived” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “since we have been apart from you, we feel like orphans” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:17	lmpu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸς καιρὸν ὥρας	1	Here, **for the time of an hour** is an idiom that indicates a short time span.

2:18	n0jl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐγὼ μὲν Παῦλος, καὶ ἅπαξ καὶ δίς	1	In this phrase, Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “I Paul personally tried to come twice” or “Indeed, I, Paul tried to go two times” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
2:18	uqg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ἐγὼ μὲν Παῦλος	1	Here Paul uses the pronoun **I**, and he uses**indeed** to emphasize that he personally tried to visit the Thessalonian church.

2:18	crv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	3	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to what was expected, that Paul would visit the Thessalonian church.

2:18	uuae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἐνέκοψεν	1	Since the Greek word that ULT translates as **hindered** often means “cut off” or “beat in,” Paul may be stressing the violent nature of Satan’s obstruction. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “powerfully prevented us” or “violently obstructed us” or “cut off our route” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
2:19	j7j5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? Is it not even you before our Lord Jesus at his coming?	0	Paul uses these rhetorical questions here to emphasize why the apostles want to visit the Thessalonian church.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

2:19	jfak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἐλπὶς ἢ χαρὰ ἢ στέφανος καυχήσεως	1	Here, **hope**, **joy**, and **crown of boasting** are spoken of figuratively as if these concepts were the Thessalonian church.

Who gives us reason to boast victoriously?”(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
2:19	e7tl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	στέφανος καυχήσεως	1	Here, **crown** refers figuratively to a laurel wreath awarded to victorious athletes.

3:intro	j379				0	# 1 Thessalonians 3 General Notes\n\n## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 3\n\n1. Timothy’s Visit (3:1-5)\n* Apostolic concern (3:1-2)\n* Apostolic encouragement (3:3-5)\n2. Timothy’s Report (3:6-13)\n* Good news (3:6-10)\n* Apostolic prayer (3:11-13)\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe first part of this chapter recounts Timothy’s visit to Thessalonica. The second part tells about his report to Paul and Silvanus at Athens. Lastly, the apostles offer a prayer on behalf of the Thessalonian church.\n\n## “We” and “You”\n\nIn this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** is used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nIn this chapter, the Apostle Paul uses the phrase “stand firm” in [3:8](../03/08.md) as a metaphor of faithfulness to the Gospel, and “be shaken” in [3:3](../03/03.md) as the opposite of being faithful. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\nUse a building metaphor, the apostles pray that God will “strengthen the “hearts” of the Thessalonian church “blameless” (See [3:13](../03/13.md)).\n\nThe enemy of God’s people, “Satan” (See [2:18](../02/18.md)) is here called “the tempter” (See [3:5](../03/05.md)).\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nPaul uses emotional and extreme language when speaking of his memory of the Thessalonian church. “Enduring it no longer,” the apostles and especially Paul (See [3:1,5](../03/01.md)) feel compelled to find out about the spiritual condition of the church. The intensity and duration of the apostles’ prayers is described as “night and day pleading earnestly” (See [3:10](../03/10.md)).\n\n### The Second Coming of Christ\n\nHere the apostles pray that the Thessalonian church will be preserved holy when Christ comes again with all his holy ones or “saints” (See [3:13](../03/13.md)).

If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that communicates anxious longing.

Paul reminds the Thessalonian church that what he predicted about the apostles’ sufferings has come true, so they should not be tempted to doubt the apostles’ authority or teaching (See [3:5,7](../03/05.md)).

If it is clearer in your language, you could include mention of Timothy. Alternate translation: “Again, since I could not wait anymore, I sent Timothy to learn if you still trust in God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
3:5	o9ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	κἀγὼ μηκέτι στέγων, ἔπεμψα	1	Paul repeats the same phrase **no longer enduring it** found in [3:1](../03/01.md). Here, “I sent” parallels “we sent” in [3:1-2](../03/01.md). This expresses that Paul represents the apostles who sent Timothy to Thessalonica. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this parallelism. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
3:5	st3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	κἀγὼ μηκέτι στέγων	1	This phrase is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express deep concern. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows deep concern. See your translation at [3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:5	zn36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔπεμψα	1	Here it is implied that Paul **sent** Timothy. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, sent Timothy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:5	judq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς τὸ γνῶναι τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν	1	This is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why he **sent** Timothy. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “so that I could learn if you remained faithful” or “in order to discern whether you still trust God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
3:5	nopp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ πειράζων	1	Here Paul uses the phrase **the tempter** as a title to identify Satan (See Matthew 4:3). The phrase means “one who tempts.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase. Alternate translation: “Satan, the one who tempts” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:5	ua7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	μή πως ἐπείρασεν ὑμᾶς ὁ πειράζων, καὶ	1	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to help his readers recognize how powerful satanic temptation can be. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “because if Satan tempted you, I wanted to find out, and then” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
3:5	gnow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ εἰς κενὸν γένηται ὁ κόπος ἡμῶν	1	This phrase could be a result clause. Paul is stating what would be the result if the Thessalonian church let Satan tempt them to stop trusting God. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a result clause. Alternate translation: “then how hard we worked would have been worthless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:5	jnzb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	εἰς κενὸν	1	Here, **in vain** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express how sad the apostles would have been if the Thessalonian church had not remained faithful to God. Paul does not really think the apostles’ **labor** is worthless. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows deep disappointment. Alternate translation: “worthless” or “purposeless” or “profitless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:6	esxw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	Connecting Statement:	0	# Connecting Statement:\n\nIn [3:6](../03/06.md) Paul describes Timothy’s current report about the Thessalonian church. Paul provides this background information to help his readers understand how comforted he is (See [3:7](../03/07.md)).Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
3:6	r4pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἄρτι δὲ ἐλθόντος Τιμοθέου πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀφ’ ὑμῶν	1	# Connecting Statement:\n\nThe phrase **But just now** brings Paul’s narrative into the present time. Use a natural way in your language to express this emphasis. Alternate translation: “But Timothy recently returned to us from visiting you” or “But now, Timothy is back to us from his visit with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
3:6	gci4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	πρὸς ἡμᾶς	1	This is an exclusive use of **us**, referring to Paul and Silvanus. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:6	tu8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use the abstract nouns **faith** and **love**, you can express the idea behind them in another way. Alternate translation: “that you remain faithful to God and love him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:6	fu8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	τὴν πίστιν καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην ὑμῶν	1	This phrase could express a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **faith** could describe **love**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “your faithful love” or “your faithful love toward God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
3:6	tf95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ ὅτι ἔχετε μνείαν ἡμῶν ἀγαθὴν πάντοτε, ἐπιποθοῦντες ἡμᾶς ἰδεῖν	1	This phrase could indicate a result clause. If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “and you constantly desire to visit with us, because you always remember us fondly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:6	e6kx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ὅτι ἔχετε μνείαν ἡμῶν ἀγαθὴν πάντοτε	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun **memories**, you can express the idea behind it in another way. Alternate translation: “and how you always remember us fondly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:7	dpij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο παρεκλήθημεν, ἀδελφοί, ἐφ’ ὑμῖν	1	This phrase is a result clause. Paul is stating the result of the Timothy’s good news in [3:6](../03/06.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a result clause. Alternate translation: “Fellow believers in Christ, as a result of Timothy’s good news about you, God consoled us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:7	csz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ ἀνάγκῃ καὶ θλίψει ἡμῶν	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **distress** describes the **affliction**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Here this phrase emphasizes how much and how intensely the apostles were persecuted. Alternate translation: “in all our abusive affliction” or “in all our violent suffering” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
3:7	e96u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ ἀνάγκῃ καὶ θλίψει ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use the abstract nouns **distress** and **affliction**, you can express them in another way. Here, it could refer to: (1) the time of distress and affliction. Alternate translation: “during all our abuse and affliction” or “each time we violently suffered” (2) the place or way of distress and affliction. Alternate translation: “in every place the tempter violently afflicted us” or “in every way we suffered abuse” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:8	utk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι νῦν ζῶμεν, ἐὰν ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Since you are remaining faithful to the Lord Jesus, we are now refreshed!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:8	y1vb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὅτι νῦν ζῶμεν	1	Here, **For now we live** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how thankful he is that the Thessalonians **stand firm** in the Christian faith (See [3:7](../03/07.md)). Paul is not trying to say that he was dead. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows thankfulness. Alternate translation (replace the comma): “O how we are now refreshed!” or “O how we now feel alive!” or “Certainly now we thrive!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:8	x4zn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐὰν ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Here, the term **stand firm** is an idiom meaning “remain faithful.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “when you remain faithful to the Lord” or “if you continue unwavering in your relationship with the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:8	zbyo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since you are remaining faithful to the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
3:8	hk91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the Thessalonian church as though they were occupying space inside the Lord Jesus. Here, this metaphor, **in the Lord**, could express these ideas: (1) devotion to Jesus. Alternate translation: “you are really devoted to the Lord Jesus” (2) relationship with Jesus. Alternate translation: “you are truly standing firm in your relationship with the Lord Jesus” (3) union with Jesus. Alternate translation: “all of you are firmly united to the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:8	e3pe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	ὑμεῖς	1	Paul uses the word **yourselves** to emphasize his joy for the Thessalonian church’s faithfulness. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternative translation: “indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
3:9	pzq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίνα γὰρ εὐχαριστίαν δυνάμεθα τῷ Θεῷ ἀνταποδοῦναι περὶ ὑμῶν, ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ χαρᾷ ᾗ χαίρομεν δι’ ὑμᾶς, ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν.	1	Paul is using a rhetorical question that continues to the end of [3:10](../03/10.md) in order to emphasize the apostles’ thankful joy for the Thessalonian church’s faithfulness to God. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We could not possibly thank God enough for what he has done for you! When we pray to our God, we greatly rejoice because of you!” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:9	pdc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τίνα γὰρ εὐχαριστίαν δυνάμεθα τῷ Θεῷ ἀνταποδοῦναι περὶ ὑμῶν	1	With the phrase **give back**, Paul speaks figuratively of the apostles as if they owe God a debt for the sake of the Thessalonian church’s faithfulness. Paul means that the apostles cannot adequately express how thankful they are. If your readers would not understand what it means to **give back** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Because, how could we possibly show how grateful we are to God for you” or “Indeed, what kind of thanksgiving for you could we give to God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:9	j6pj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ χαρᾷ ᾗ χαίρομεν δι’ ὑμᾶς, ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Since this is a rhetorical question, you could change it to a statement, and begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Because of you, we greatly rejoice when we pray to God,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
3:9	u00t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ χαρᾷ ᾗ χαίρομεν	1	Here, **joy** and **rejoice** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how much joy the apostles have because of how faithful the Thessalonian church has been towards God. Alternate translation: “for how much we greatly rejoice” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:9	p5ka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	χαίρομεν & ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν	1	Here, **before our God** is an idiom for being in the personal presence of God. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “we rejoice in the presence of our God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:10	k71n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας, ὑπέρἐκπερισσοῦ δεόμενοι	1	This emphatic phrase is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how much and often the apostles pray for the Thessalonian church. Paul does not mean to say he never does anything else except pray. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we never stop intensely pleading” or “we continually and fervently pray” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
3:10	eb26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς τὸ ἰδεῖν ὑμῶν τὸ πρόσωπον	1	Here, the phrase **to see your face** is an idiom meaning “visit.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “to visit you” or “to spend time with you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:10	s0xz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ὑμῶν τὸ πρόσωπον	1	Paul refers figuratively to **your face** to mean the whole Thessalonian church. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “all of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
3:10	e5fh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	καὶ καταρτίσαι τὰ ὑστερήματα τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun **faith**, you can express the idea behind it in another way (See also [2:17](../02/17.md)). Alternate translation: “and to provide support so that you remain faithful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:11	tet9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	δὲ & κατευθύναι	1	# General Information:\n\nHere the verb forms indicate that this is a blessing or prayer that continues through [3:13](../03/13.md). Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing or prayer in your language. Alternate translation: “Now we pray that … would guide” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
3:11	f3wh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ὁ Θεὸς καὶ Πατὴρ ἡμῶν	1	Here, **our God and Father** refers to the one divine person who is both God and Father. This phrase is a hendiadys, since Father further describes God (See also [1:3](../01/03.md)). Alternate translation: “God our Father” or “our Father God” (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys)
3:11	mc2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς	1	Paul uses the word **himself** to distinguish **our God and Father** from **our Lord Jesus**. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
3:11	bql9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν & ἡμῶν & ἡμῶν	1	It is possible that these first two uses of **our** are inclusive of the whole Christian Church. Yet, the third use of **our** exclusively refers to the apostles. So, it is most likely that **our** refers exclusively to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy in this whole verse (see also [1:9, 2:1, 3:9](../01/09.md)). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
3:11	um1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατευθύναι τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς.	1	Paul speaks figuratively about God as if he were a pilot or captain of a ship. Paul means that he wants God to allow the apostles to visit the Thessalonian church again. If your readers would not understand what **direct our way to you** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “quickly bring us to you” or “direct our voyage so that we can visit you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	f4ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὑμᾶς δὲ ὁ Κύριος πλεονάσαι καὶ περισσεύσαι	1	Here, **increase** and **abound** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how much the apostles want the Thessalonian church to keep increasing in their love for all people. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “May the Lord Jesus make you completely excel” or “O that the Lord Jesus would cause you to fully thrive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:12	o80n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ἀγάπῃ	1	Paul speaks figuratively of **love** as something that can be quantified or measured. He means that he hopes the Thessalonian church will keep loving people well. If your readers would not understand what **in love** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “in the way you love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:12	ofl2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	εἰς ἀλλήλους, καὶ εἰς πάντας	1	Paul could be speaking figuratively, using these phrases in order to include the whole human race. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “toward each and every person” or “toward the whole human race” or “toward Christians and non-Christians” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
3:12	gyy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	εἰς πάντας	1	Paul could be using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. It could refer to: (1) the whole human race. Alternate translation: “toward all humanity” (2) all Christians. Alternate translation: “for all your fellow believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
3:12	dm6c			καθάπερ καὶ ἡμεῖς εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, **just as we also toward you** is an emphatic phrase meant to reinforce the deep love the apostles have for the Thessalonian church (also in [3:6](../03/06.md)). Use a natural way in your language to express this emphasis. Alternate translation: “in the same way that we love you”
3:13	ms8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὸ στηρίξαι ὑμῶν τὰς καρδίας, ἀμέμπτους ἐν ἁγιωσύνῃ	1	If your language does not use the abstract nouns **hearts** and **holiness**, you can express the ideas behind them in another way. Alternate translation: “so that how you love one another strengthens you to become resolved to live blamelessly, as is appropriate for those who belong to the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:13	ly21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ στηρίξαι ὑμῶν τὰς καρδίας	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the people of the Thessalonian church as if they have one heart that is like a building that can be established or supported. He means that he wants God to increase their willpower or affections so that they would remain faithful to God. If your readers would not understand what this phrase means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “to establish your affections” or “to strengthen your will” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
3:13	taws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς τὸ στηρίξαι ὑμῶν τὰς καρδίας	1	This phrase is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why he prays that God will increase the Thessalonian church’s love for all people. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “so that the Lord will establish your affections for him” or “in order that the Lord will strengthen your willpower” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
3:13	jev8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἀμέμπτους ἐν ἁγιωσύνῃ	1	Here, **blameless** and **holiness** mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize total sanctification. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. This phrase could refer to: (1) a condition of holiness. Alternate translation: “blameless in a condition of holiness” (2) how to become holy. Alternate translation: “blameless through holiness” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
3:13	p12j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1	This phrase is an idiom for being in the personal presence of God (See [3:9](../03/09.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “in the presence of our Father God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
3:13	vnsi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ, μετὰ πάντων τῶν ἁγίων αὐτοῦ	1	This is a reference to Zechariah 14:5 (See also 2 Thessalonians 1:7,10; Jude 14). Here it is implied that these **saints** are all those who are **blameless in holiness** and who have already died (See [4:14](../04/14.md)). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the time the Lord Jesus arrives along with all his holy people who have already died” or “when the Lord Jesus returns a second time with all those reposed people who belong to him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:13	ytqg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, **at the coming of the Lord Jesus** is a well-known idiom in 1-2 Thessalonians for the Second Coming of Christ (See [2:19; 4:15](../02/19.md)) or the “Day of the **Lord**” [5:2](../05/02.md)). Use a natural way in your language to emphasize this idea. Alternate translation: “in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his Second Coming” or “in the sight of our Lord Jesus when he arrives again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:intro	b1z5				0	# 1 Thessalonians 4 General Notes\n\n## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 4\n\n1. Apostolic Teachings on Holiness (4:1-8)\n2. Apostolic Teachings on Christian Love (4:9-12)\n* Reminder (4:9-10)\n* Keep Busy (4:11-12)\n3. Apostolic Teachings on the Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13-18)\n\n## “We” and “You”\n\nIn this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Christian love\n\nThe apostles address the topic of Christian love that the Thessalonian church had previously asked about. The apostles encouraged the church that they were already loving well, and they should continue to grow in this practice. The apostles also link “brotherly love” to living in harmony with each other and minding their own business, so that they would be a good example to non-Christians (See [4:11-12](../04/11.md)).\n\n### Dying before the Second Coming of Christ\n\nThe Thessalonian church was concerned about what would happen if a believer died before Christ returned. They were anxious to know whether or not those who died before Christ returned would be part of the Kingdom of God. Paul addresses that concern in [4:13-5:11](../04/13.md).\n\n### The manner of the Second Coming of Christ\n\nIn [4:13-18](../04/13.md), the apostles teach about the events related to the Second Coming of Christ (called “the day of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md)). This is so that the Thessalonians can “comfort one another with these words” (See [4:18](../04/18.md)).\n\n## Important Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Sexual immorality\n\nDifferent cultures have different standards of sexual morality. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate these sensitive issues.\n\n### The Second Coming of Christ and the Day of the Lord\n\nAll Christians believe that Jesus will return to earth to judge all people and to rule forever. As the Nicene Creed (381 A.D.) states: “I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come.” Christ came once as Incarnate God and will return once as Resurrected Judge. However, there are various ways that Christians understand the “coming of the Lord” as explained in [4:13-5:11](../04/13.md), and the “day of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md). Some believe they are one and the same event, but others believe them to be two separate events. Your translation should state clearly only what is clear in these verses without promoting any particular interpretation.
4:1	vtas		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	λοιπὸν οὖν	1	Here, **So finally** could refer to: (1) a summary of the apostles’ teachings. Alternate translation: “So, in summary,” (2) the remaining things to address. “So then, here is what remains for us to talk about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:1	u2lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐρωτῶμεν ὑμᾶς καὶ παρακαλοῦμεν	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how seriously the apostles want the Thessalonian church to follow their teachings. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “we are urging and appealing to you” or “we strongly urge you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
4:1	foeh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul speaks figuratively as if the apostles are occupying space inside of **the Lord Jesus**. Here, the metaphor expresses the idea that the apostles represent Jesus himself like ambassadors who possess a king’s authority. If your readers would not understand what **in the Lord** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

The word **please** describes how the Thessalonian church should **walk**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “about how you must live to please God (exactly as you live now)” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

4:4	f4ux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ ἑαυτοῦ σκεῦος, κτᾶσθαι	1	Here Paul speaks figuratively of a person’s body as if it were a container. Here, **to possess his own vessel** is a metaphor that compares sexual self-control to a proper use of a container. If your readers would not understand what this phrase means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. It could refer to: (1) a wife’s body.

Alternate translation: “because God himself teaches you that you should love each other, you do not need us to write to you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:9	l1n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε γράφειν ὑμῖν	1	Here, **no need** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how successfully the Thessalonian church is practicing Christian love.

Paul means that the Thessalonian church already has been taught **to love one another** through the words of Jesus (See John 13:34; 15:12, 17) by the apostles. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **taught by God** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “because you have learned well what God teaches,” or “since this is what God teaches you to do,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

4:10	gxfa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	παρακαλοῦμεν δὲ ὑμᾶς, ἀδελφοί,	1	Speaking of what the apostles **exhort** the Thessalonian church to do, Paul uses a repetitive series of five verb forms that continues into [4:11](../04/11.md). This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone is urged to do. Alternate translation: “Now, fellow believers in Christ, we are urging you” or “But, fellow Christians, we strongly encourage you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])

If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “and seek to lovingly honor others: by living quietly and tending to your own business and focusing on doing your own work” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Here, **just as we commanded** also expresses that what the apostles teach is the same as being “taught by God” (See [4:9](../04/09.md)). If this would not be understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation as a new sentence: “This is what we already commanded you to do” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
4:12	wj25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	Here, **so that** could introduce a purpose clause.

Alternate translation: “you would live appropriately” or “you would live nobly” or “you would behave modestly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:12	k59r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρὸς τοὺς ἔξω	1	Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they were physically located outside of an area. He means that they are not part of the Christian community. If your readers would not understand what “before those outside” means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

Alternate translation: “in the presence of non-Christians” or “in front of those who do not trust in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:12	nait		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ μηδενὸς χρείαν ἔχητε	1	This is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for the apostles’ exhortation in [4:10](../04/10.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “and so that you would not need anything” or “and then you could be self-sufficient” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:13	vi2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	# General Information:\n\nHere, **Now** is a connecting word that signals the beginning of an extended section in [4:13-5:11](../04/13.md) about the Second Coming of Christ (See chapter and book introduction)(See also 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10; 2:3-12). If our language has a special section marker, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:13	lan8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ θέλομεν δὲ ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν	1	# General Information:\n\nPaul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “We want you to know for certain” or “Now we desire to clarify” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
4:13	qt5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περὶ	1	Here, **concerning** implies that the apostles are answering another specific question previously asked by the Thessalonian church (See [4:9](../04/09.md)). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as it relates to your question about” or “concerning your question about” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:13	j68e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	τῶν κοιμωμένων	1	# General Information:\n\nHere, **those who are asleep** is a euphemism for death that continues through [5:10](../05/10.md). In this specific context, it refers to those human souls who are awaiting the reunion of their bodies at the Second Coming of Christ (See [4:16–17](../04/16.md)). You could either use a similar euphemism for death in your language or say this in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “those who are already dead” or “those who have died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
4:13	ocjp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα μὴ λυπῆσθε	1	Here, **so that you may not grieve** is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why he does not want the Thessalonian church to remain ignorant about the destiny of their loved ones **who are asleep**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “so that you would not sorrow” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:13	r9f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	καθὼς καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ	1	Paul is using the adjective phrase **the rest** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “like the rest of people” or “in the same way as the rest of humanity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
4:13	f9eq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ μὴ ἔχοντες ἐλπίδα	1	Here Paul assumes that his readers will know that **hope** refers to salvation at the final resurrection (See [1:3; 2:19; 4:16; 5:8](../01/03.md)). Previously **hope** was associated with the Second Coming of Christ in [2:19](../02/19.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “who possess no confidence of life after death” or “who possess no assurance of life after death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:13	puvg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	οἱ μὴ ἔχοντες ἐλπίδα	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun **hope**, you can express the idea behind it in another way. Alternate translation: “who are not confident of life after death” “who are not sure about life after death” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
4:14	j09o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ γὰρ πιστεύομεν ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἀνέστη	1	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he actually means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think what the apostles are saying is not certain, then you can translate their words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “As we certainly believe that Jesus died and resurrected” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
4:14	hmw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πιστεύομεν ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἀνέστη	1	Here it is assumed that the Thessalonian church knows the apostolic teaching that **Jesus died and rose again**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “we apostles trust―as you already know―that Jesus died and rose again” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:14	ybz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	πιστεύομεν	1	Although **we believe** could be inclusive of the Thessalonian church (and by extension all Christians), it is most likely exclusive, referring to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. The previous use in [4:11](../04/11.md) and subsequent uses (See “we say” in [4:15](../04/15.md)) are clearly referring to the apostles. Here, it mostly likely is a reference to their authoritative teaching. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:14	kmk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὕτως & ὁ Θεὸς	1	This phrase could refer to: (1) result. Alternate translation: “then God” (2) manner. Alternate translation: “this is the way God” or “this is how God” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:14	m1fy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς κοιμηθέντας διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ.	1	Paul is using the possessive form. Here, **through Jesus** could refer to: (1) being united to Jesus’ resurrection power **through** death. Alternate translation: “God will bring back with Jesus those who are united to him in death” (2) those who God will also bring back again **through** Jesus. Alternate translation: “it is through Jesus that God will bring back the dead people who are with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:14	tjqj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτῷ	1	Here Paul implies that **him** refers to **Jesus**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:15	vvda		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	τοῦτο γὰρ ὑμῖν λέγομεν ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου	1	This clause indicates that what follows is something else important that the Thessalonian church should pay attention to (See also [1:8](../01/08.md) for **the word of the Lord**). Alternate translation: “Certainly, what we now say to you is the Lord Jesus’ message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:15	ni3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου	1	The phrase **the word of the Lord** figuratively refers to “the whole message of the Lord’s gospel.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Here, **word** could refer to: (1) the authority of the message. Alternate translation: “because the Lord Jesus authorized our message” (2) the means of the message. Alternate translation: “with a message from the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
4:15	gbe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	Κυρίου, ὅτι ἡμεῖς	1	Here, **that** indicates that the rest of the verse is the content of **the word of the Lord**. You could indicate this by changing the punctuation or some other natural way in your language. Alternate translation: “of the Lord: we” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:15	fdwk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	λέγομεν & ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες	1	When Paul says **we say**, he is speaking of himself, Silvanus, and Timothy, so **we** would be exclusive. However, when Paul says **we who are alive**, since he seems to be referring to all Christians, **we who are alive** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “we apostles say … all of us believers in Christ who are still alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:15	hdlr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	οἱ περιλειπόμενοι	1	This phrase gives us further information about **we who are alive**. It is not making a distinction between **who are left behind** and **we who are alive**. If this is not understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “and survive” or “and remain here” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
4:15	b786		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἰς τὴν παρουσίαν τοῦ Κυρίου	1	Here, **coming of the Lord** is a well-known idiom in 1-2 Thessalonians for the Second Coming of Christ [3:13](../03/13.md) or the “Day of the **Lord**” [5:2](../05/02.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “until the Lord Jesus returns” or “for the Second Coming of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
4:15	xd2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ φθάσωμεν τοὺς κοιμηθέντας	1	Here, the phrase translated **certainly not** is a strong prohibition meaning “never.” If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement as in the UST. Alternate translation: “will never precede those who are dead” or “are not permitted to come before those who have already died” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
4:16	ah7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1	Here, **For** indicates that following events are related to the Second Coming. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this. Alternately translation: “Certainly,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
4:16	c26b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὅτι αὐτὸς ὁ Κύριος ἐν κελεύσματι, ἐν φωνῇ ἀρχαγγέλου, καὶ ἐν σάλπιγγι Θεοῦ, καταβήσεται ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ	1	In this verse, Paul is describing events that happen at the same time **the Lord will descend from heaven**. He emphasizes the order of events by listing them prior to the main verb. If it is clearer in your language, you could place the main verb before the accompanying actions. You can also make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “Certainly, the Lord Jesus himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, and with the archangel’s voice, and with God’s trumpet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
4:16	ygfp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς ὁ Κύριος	1	Paul uses the word **himself** to emphasize that the Lord Jesus will come back in person. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus will come back personally” or “the very person, the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
4:16	z9ka			ἀρχαγγέλου	1	See Jude 9 for the only other use of this word in the Bible.
4:16	breq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	σάλπιγγι Θεοῦ	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe **a trumpet** that is related to God. Here, **trumpet of God** could refer to: (1) a trumpet that God commands to be blown. Alternate translation: “a trumpet that God orders to be blown” (2) a trumpet that belongs to God. Alternate translation: “God’s trumpet” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
4:16	pjrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	καταβήσεται ἀπ’ οὐρανοῦ; καὶ οἱ νεκροὶ ἐν Χριστῷ ἀναστήσονται πρῶτον	1	The first main verb **descend** is listed after the events that describe it. This is to show contrast with the second verb **rise**. After the **Lord** Jesus comes down from **heaven**, the **dead** Christians will resurrect from the earth. Paul makes two opposite statements, in similar ways, to emphasis the dramatic nature of the Lord’s Second Coming. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “will come down from heaven, but the first to resurrect from the earth will be the dead people who are united to Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
4:16	k7sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	2	The word **and** indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “and then after that,” or “and afterward,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
4:16	dr89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ νεκροὶ	1	Paul assumes that the Thessalonian church knows that **the dead** are the same as “those who are asleep” in [4:13–15](../04/13.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. See how you translated “fallen asleep” in [4:13–15](../04/13.md) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:16	xrxu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul speaks figuratively about **the dead** as though they were occupying space inside **Christ**. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to **Christ** (See also [2:14](../02/14.md)). Here, it also highlights the communion that living Thessalonian believers **in Christ** have with the believers **in Christ** who have died. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “who are united to Jesus Christ” or “who share life with Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
4:17	iy00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἔπειτα	1	Here, **Then** indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “After that,” or “Afterward,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
4:17	l5l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες	1	Though **we who are alive** could be exclusive of the apostles (See note for the same phrase at [4:15](../04/15.md)), the universal content of this section implies that all Christians are in view, so **we** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “all of us believers in Christ who remain alive” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
4:17	otiq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἅμα σὺν αὐτοῖς	1	Here, Paul refers to “the dead in Christ” (See [4:16](../04/16.md)) as **them**. If this is confusing in your language, you can make the reference explicit. Alternate translation: “together with the dead in Christ (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:17	aj1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἅμα σὺν αὐτοῖς	1	Here, **together with them** could refer to: (1) a simultaneous event. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “with them at the same time” (2) association with the “dead in Christ.” Alternate translation: “along with the dead in Christ” (3) both event and association. Alternate translation: “at the same time together with the dead in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
4:17	m3gb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἁρπαγησόμεθα ἐν νεφέλαις εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ Κυρίου εἰς ἀέρα	1	Here it is assumed that Paul is referring to the words of the angels at Jesus’ Ascension in [Acts 1:9-11] (acts/01/09.md), as a fulfillment of the prophecy in [Daniel 7:13-14](../dan/07/13.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could provide a footnote or reference. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
4:17	o7lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἀπάντησιν	1	Here, **to meet** is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why living believers **will be caught up together** with “the dead in Christ.” Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order to encounter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
4:17	ukh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἐν νεφέλαις εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ Κυρίου εἰς ἀέρα	1	Here, **clouds** and **air** could be considered symbolic language representing God’s presence and the spiritual realm (See Exodus 19; Daniel 7:13-14; Matthew 24; Mark 13; Luke 17; 21; Ephesians 2:2). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to spiritually encounter the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
4:17	ti69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	καὶ οὕτως	1	This clause is meant to signal the end of the events related to the Second Coming. You can use the natural form in your language for expressing the conclusion of a story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
4:17	ouvu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ οὕτως	1	This clause also indicates the result of the meeting with **the Lord**. Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “and then” or “as a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:17	k6qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	σὺν Κυρίῳ	1	Here, **with the Lord** parallels **together with them** to express union with Christ as communion with his people. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
4:18	gt91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε παρακαλεῖτε	1	This is a result clause. Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “So then, keep encouraging” or “Because of this, you must comfort” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
4:18	y7zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρακαλεῖτε	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates an appeal rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates an appeal. Alternate translation: “you should encourage” or “please continue to comfort (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
4:18	aya5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀλλήλους	1	The pronoun **one another** refers to the Thessalonian church. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “each fellow member of your church” or “your fellow Thessalonian believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
4:18	xsus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν τοῖς λόγοις τούτοις	1	Here, **with these words** could refer to “we will always be with the Lord” in [4:17](../04/17.md) or figuratively to all that has been said in [4:13-17](../04/13.md). Alternate translation: “by reminding each other of our message” or “with these promises” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
5:intro	ay3d				0	# 1 Thessalonians 5 General Notes\n\n## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 5\n\n1. Apostolic Teachings on the Second Coming of Christ (5:1-10)\n* Timing (5:1-3)\n* Preparation (5:4-8)\n* God’s plan (5:9-10)\n2. Final Instructions (5:11-28)\n* Final Commands (5:11-22)\n* Final Prayer (5:23-24)\n* Final Appeals (5:25-27)\n* Final blessing (5:25-27)\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nPaul concludes his letter in a way that was typical of letters in the ancient Near East.\n\n## “We” and “You”\n\nIn this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Idiom\n\n#### Day of the Lord\n\nThe “day of the Lord” is an idiom for the time of final salvation for God’s people and final judgment for God’s enemies. “Day” is metaphorical for a time period. Thus, the exact time of the coming “day of the Lord” will be a surprise to the world. The simile “like a thief in the night” refers to this surprise timing. Because of this, Christians must prepare for the coming of the Lord by living with faith, hope and love [5:8](../05/08.md) toward God and others. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]])\n\n### Simile\n\n#### Like a thief\n\nThe simile “like a thief in the night” refers to this surprise timing. Because of this, Christians must prepare for the coming of the Lord by living with faith, hope, and love [5:8](../05/08.md) toward God and others. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Metaphor\n\n#### Day and night, light and darkness\n\nThe apostles use many metaphors throughout [5:1-11](../05/1.md). “Night,” “darkness,” “drunk,” “sleep” are all metaphors about spiritual ignorance or lack of readiness. “Day,” “light,” “sober,” “watch” are all metaphors about spiritual awareness and readiness.\n\n#### Armor\n\nHere, the apostles use a military metaphor to urge the Thessalonian church to be ready for Christ’s Second Coming at “the day of the Lord.” Just as soldiers must always be armed and ready to fight, so the Christian must live prepared for Christ’s return. Faithfulness and love are compared to a breastplate, and the hope of salvation is likened to a helmet [5:8](../05/08.md).\n\n#### Prophecy\n\nThose who “despise prophecies” in [5:20](../05/20.md) are said to “quench the Spirit.” This is a metaphor for trying to hinder the Holy Spirit’s guidance in the Church. All prophecies are to be examined and tested to determine if they adhere to apostolic teaching [5:21](../05/21.md). All prophecies that are proven to agree with apostolic teaching, are to be retained as good [5:21-22](../05/21/.md).\n\n### Submission to Christian leadership\n\nThe apostles link the well-being and spiritual safety of the Thessalonian church to obedience to their leaders. Christian leaders are to be given recognition and loving respect by the church [5:12-13](../05/12.md).\n\n### Holy Kiss\n\nThis refers to the ancient practice of exchanging a kiss of peace on the cheek during the liturgy. Different cultures have different standards of appropriate physical contact. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate this sensitive issue [5:26](../05/26.md).
5:1	i2vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περὶ δὲ τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	# General Information:\n\nHere, **Now concerning** signals a change in subject (See also [4:9](../04/09.md)). This phrase implies that the apostles are answering a specific question previously asked by the Thessalonian church about the timing of “the coming of the Lord” and how the church should prepare for it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now, about your question related to the exact timing of the Lord’s return” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
5:1	a8f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	# General Information:\n\nHere, **the times and the seasons** is an idiom referring to a specific point in time or a time period. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. This phrase could refer to: (1) a specific point in time. Alternate translation: “the appointed time when Jesus returns” or “the fixed time when Jesus returns” (See [Acts 1:7](acts/01/07.md)) for this exact phrase referring to the same thing)). (2) a specific amount of time. Alternate translation: “how long it will take for the Lord Jesus to return” or “when the Lord Jesus will return” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:1	caue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε ὑμῖν γράφεσθαι	1	# General Information:\n\nHere words are left out in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, **for us** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:2	yvg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	perfectly well	0	This verse begins an extended list of contrasting similes that continues through [5:8](../05/08.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use equivalent comparisons or express these meanings in a non-figurative way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
5:2	dqgk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἀκριβῶς οἴδατε	1	The words **For**, **yourselves**, and **perfectly** emphasize how clearly the Thessalonian church should understand when and how the Lord’s Second Coming will happen. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “In fact, it is certain that you recognize accurately” or “You are certainly well aware of this fact” or “Indeed, you know precisely” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
5:2	mcq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church has “no need that anything be written” to them about the timing and manner of the Lord’s Second Coming (See [5:1](../05/01.md)). Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Certainly,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:2	tu9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἡμέρα Κυρίου	1	Here, **the day of the Lord** is an idiom that refers to the Old Testament concept of the time of God’s final judgment. The context of this passage makes it clear that **the day of the Lord** is synonymous with “the coming of the Lord” Jesus in [4:15](../04/15.md). (See also [Acts 2:20](../act/02/20.md); [1 Corinthians 5:5](../1co/05/05.md); [2 Thessalonians 2:2](../2th/02/02.md); [2 Peter 3:10](../2pe/03/10.md)). Use a natural way in your language to emphasize this idea. Alternate translation; “the time when the Lord Jesus returns again to earth” or “the time when the Lord Jesus will finally judge” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:2	tmj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς κλέπτης ἐν νυκτὶ οὕτως ἔρχεται	1	The point of this comparison is that, just like a thief at night comes unexpectedly, the way Jesus will return is unexpected and the timing of his return is unknown. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “is going to come as unexpectedly as a robber at night” or “is going to come so surprisingly–like when a thief breaks in at night” or “is going to happen like this–all of a sudden” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
5:3	p1wi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ὅταν λέγωσιν, εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια	1	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to express the suddenness of the “the day of the Lord.” Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Whenever they might say, ‘Everything is safe and sound,’” or “At a time when people are saying, ‘All is well,’” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
5:3	mjvd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τότε	1	Here what follows the word **then** is in contrast to the **Peace and safety** these people expected to last. Instead, **sudden destruction comes** on them. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:3	ne9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	τότε αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος	1	Here, **sudden destruction** parallels the idea of terror that accompanies a sudden attack by “a thief in the night” (See [5:2](../05/02.md)). If it would be clearer in your language, you could make this idea explicit. Alternate translation: “then sudden calamity strikes” or “then immediate destruction looms over them” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
5:3	sde2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος, ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	Here, **sudden** describes the unexpected timing of **birth pains** , and **certainly not escape** describes the nature of **destruction**. Paul says similar things with these phrases to show that God’s final judgment will be a total surprise and complete ruin for unbelievers. Use a natural way in your language to emphasize these ideas. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
5:3	f1xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	The point of this comparison is that, just like a pregnant woman suddenly experiences labor pains, God’s final judgment will come suddenly and be inescapable. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “just as suddenly as labor pains seize a pregnant woman–these people can never escape God’s destruction” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
5:3	iwc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ	1	Here, **having in the womb** is an idiom meaning “pregnant.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “do for a woman in late pregnancy” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:3	undo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	Here, **certainly not** is a strong prohibition meaning “never” (See [4:15](../04/15.md)). If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “they will never escape” or “there is no way to possibly escape” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
5:4	sk6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὑμεῖς δέ	1	Here what follows the words **But you** is in contrast to the “sudden destruction” of the people in [5:3](../05/03.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Certainly you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:4	b6lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐν σκότει	1	Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they actually live in place without light. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **in darkness** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “are not unprepared” or “are not living sinfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	elp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἵνα ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς κλέπτας καταλάβῃ	1	This is a result clause. Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “causing you to be like people such as those surprised by a robber. You are ready for the time when the Lord Jesus will return” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:4	otz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ἡμέρα	1	Here, Paul speaks figuratively about the idiom “the **day** of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md), by contrasting **the day** with **darkness**. He means that because the Thessalonian church is not unaware of “the **day** of the Lord,” they will not be unprepared, like people who live **in darkness**. If your readers would not understand what **the day** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “the day of the Lord” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:4	ywez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς κλέπτας καταλάβῃ	1	Paul speaks figuratively of “the **day** of the Lord” as if it were a thief who surprises a person. He means that “the **day** of the Lord” will come suddenly for those who are unprepared (See “sudden destruction” in [5:3](../05/03.md)). If your readers would not understand what this phrase means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “making you unprepared, like when a robber breaks in at night” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:5	ddce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας. οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Here, **sons of the light** means basically the same thing as **sons of the day**. Also, **of the night** means basically the same thing as **of the darkness**. The repetition is used to emphasize how **light** characterizes **day** and how **darkness** characterizes **night**. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Certainly, all of you are ready for Christ’s Second Coming. None of us are unprepared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:5	zp3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the Thessalonian church as if the **light** and **day** were their physical parents. He means that the Thessalonian church members are God’s spiritual children who are characterized by spiritual readiness. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **sons of the light and sons of the day** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “This is because all of you who belong to God are ready for Christ’s coming” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:5	ilv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church will escape God’s judgment on “the **day** of the Lord” (See [5:2](../05/02.md)). Alternate translation: “Because in fact” or “Certainly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:5	cxo9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντες & ὑμεῖς & ἐστε	1	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to describe the whole Thessalonian church. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “you Thessalonians are all” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:5	d6fm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Again, Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they actually live in a place without light. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully (See [5:4](../05/04.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to be **of the night** or **of the darkness** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “We are not unprepared like those at night or those who live in the darkness, ” or “We are not characterized by being spiritually ignorant” or “We do not live like those who are characterized by sinful activities” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:5	kq0x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐσμὲν	1	In [5:5-10](../05/05.md), **We** is inclusive of all Christians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “We believers in Christ are” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
5:5	f4uw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe people who are characterized by spiritual ignorance or who live sinfully. This means that they will not be prepared at “**the day** of the Lord.” If this is not clear in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “characterized by being spiritually unprepared and living sinfully” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:6	paqf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἄρα οὖν	1	Here, **so then** emphatically introduces a result clause. Use a natural way in your language to introduce a result clause. Alternate translation: “therefore” or “as a result” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:6	d2aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ καθεύδωμεν ὡς οἱ λοιποί	1	Here Paul speaks figuratively about the people “of the night” and “of the darkness” are if they are sleeping. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully (See notes for “darkness” at [5:4-5](../05/04.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to **sleep** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “we must not be unprepared like non-Christians” or “let us not be like the rest of humanity, who are not aware that Jesus is coming back” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:6	on3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μὴ καθεύδωμεν & γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	Here, the verb forms **sleep**, **keep watch**, and **be sober** could also refer to: (1) commands. Alternate translation: “we must not sleep … we must keep watch and be sober” (2) appeals. Alternate translation: “let us not sleep … let us keep watch and let us be sober” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:6	x0zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ λοιποί	1	Paul is using the adjective **the rest** as a noun in order to describe those who are unprepared for Christ’s return. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “like others who are not ready for the Lord Jesus to return” or “like the rest of humanity” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:6	q33e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, what follows the word **but** is in contrast to **the rest** who **sleep**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation (starting a new sentence): “On the contrary,” or “Instead,” or “Rather,” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:6	sdww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	Here, Paul speaks figuratively of Christians as if they are watch guards. He means that they should be aware and be prepared for the Lord’s return by living as God’s people should live. If your readers would not understand what it means to **keep watch** or **be sober** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “instead, we must stay spiritually alert and prepared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:6	osxu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	These verbs express a similar idea by using two words connected with **and**. The verb **be sober** tells how Christians should **keep watch**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “we should remain calmly alert” or “let us remain soberly awake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
5:7	fxca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οἱ γὰρ καθεύδοντες, νυκτὸς καθεύδουσιν; καὶ οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι, νυκτὸς μεθύουσιν	1	These two phrases convey similar ideas by repeating the same verb forms twice. Paul says the same thing twice, in different ways, to show that **sleeping** and **getting drunk** are states of being that make people unaware or unprepared. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could condense each phrase. Alternate translation: “Certainly, people sleep at night, and people get drunk at night” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
5:7	oyjo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church should “not sleep” or be unprepared for the Lord’s return (See [5:6](../05/06.md)).

5:7	s253		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ γὰρ καθεύδοντες, νυκτὸς καθεύδουσιν	1	Here again, like in [5:6](../05/06.md), Paul speaks figuratively as if these people are actually sleeping, or it is night time. He means that these people are spiritually unprepared or unaware or even sinful (See also notes at [5:2,4](../05/02.md)). If your readers would not understand what **sleep** and **night** mean in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Those who are sleeping are unaware” or “Certainly those who are asleep are unprepared” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:7	exa8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι, νυκτὸς μεθύουσιν	1	Paul speaks figuratively as if these people are actually drunk, or it is night time. He means that these people are spiritually unprepared or unaware or sinful. If your readers would not understand what **getting drunk** or **night** mean in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “those who are drunk are unprepared” or “those who are drunk are unaware” or “those who drink too much alcohol tend to drink at night” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:8	wh3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	What follows the word **But** here is in contrast to “getting drunk” at “night” in [5:7](../05/07.md). Instead, Christians are characterized by the activities of **the day** and staying **sober** (See [5:5–6](../05/05.md)). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “However” or “Instead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:8	iv63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἡμεῖς & νήφωμεν	1	Here, **should stay sober** could refer to: (1) a command. Alternate translation: “we … must stay sober” (2) an appeal. Alternate translation: “let us … stay sober” (See your translation at [5:6](../05/06.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:8	jqqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡμεῖς δὲ ἡμέρας ὄντες	1	Paul speaks figuratively of Christians as if they are actually a part of the day time. He means that they are characterized by spiritual readiness for the Lord’s return. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **of the day** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Now, because we are ready for Christ’s coming, we” or “Since we are characterized by being ready, we” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

He means that just as a soldier must equip himself with armor in order to be ready to fight, so Christians must prepare themselves for the Second Coming of Christ with the spiritual protection of **faith**, **love**, and **hope** (See also [Ephesians 6:10-18,23](../eph/06/10.md)). If your readers would not understand what these phrases mean in this context, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:9	h5y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὅτι οὐκ ἔθετο ἡμᾶς ὁ Θεὸς εἰς ὀργὴν	1	Here, **wrath** refers to God’s future and final Judgment (See your translation of **wrath** at [1:10](../01/10/.md), [2:16](../02/16/.md)). (See also [What is the “second coming” of Jesus?](../front/intro)). If your language does not use the abstract noun **wrath**, you can express the idea behind it in another way. “Certainly, God did not destine that he would punish us” or “Indeed, God did not determine that he would judge us” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:9	lrx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church should have “the hope of salvation” (See [5:8](../05/08.md)).

5:8	l89q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	πίστεως καὶ ἀγάπης & σωτηρίας	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe things that are characterized by **faith** and **hope** and **love**. You could turn these phrases into similes if it would be clearer in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:9	erz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς & εἰς	1	Here, **to … to** introduces two purpose clauses. Paul is stating the purpose or goal for which God **appointed** the two types of people described in [5:3–8](../05/03.md)). Use a natural way in your language for introducing purpose clauses. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of … in order to” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
5:9	qmo5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to **wrath**. Here Paul emphasizes that God’s true people will not experience his final punishment. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but actually” or “but instead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
5:9	qfcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	εἰς περιποίησιν σωτηρίας	1	Here, the phrase translated **to obtain salvation** is a possessive form that Paul uses to indicate that **salvation** is something that belongs to God’s people. If this is not clear in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “for the possessing of salvation” or “for the acquiring of salvation” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:10	arhm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	τοῦ ἀποθανόντος περὶ ἡμῶν	1	Here, **the one who died for us** gives us further information about what “salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ” is (See [5:9](../05/09.md)). Paul means that God gives the guarantee that Christians will “obtain salvation,” because Jesus **died for us**. If this is not understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “who died on our behalf” or “who died for our sake” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
5:10	dzq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα & ἅμα σὺν αὐτῷ ζήσωμεν	1	This is a purpose clause. Paul is stating why Jesus **died for us**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that … we could live together with him” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
5:10	w59c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἴτε γρηγορῶμεν εἴτε καθεύδωμεν	1	Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they were physically **awake or asleep**. He means that they are “alive or dead” (See [4:14–17](../04/14.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to be **awake or asleep** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “whether we are living or even if we are dead” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:11	r921		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	διὸ	1	Here, **Therefore** indicates the conclusion of this section about timing of “the day of the Lord,” and connects to the manner of Christ’s return in [4:14–18](../04/14.md) by again using the same phrase, **comfort one another**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:11	o85i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ παρακαλεῖτε	1	**Therefore** begins a result clause. Paul explains how the Thessalonian church should respond to the fact that Jesus died so that Christians can “obtain salvation” (See [5:9](../05/09.md)). Alternate translation: “This is why you should encourage” or “As a result, you must comfort” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:11	m2c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	διὸ παρακαλεῖτε ἀλλήλους, καὶ οἰκοδομεῖτε εἷς τὸν ἕνα	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how much Paul wants the Thessalonian church to encourage and support each other. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “As a result, continue to be supportive of what each person needs” or “This is why you must supportively console each other with this message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
5:11	hepx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρακαλεῖτε & οἰκοδομεῖτε	1	These verbs are imperatives but could communicate an appeal rather than a command. You could use a form in your language that communicates an urgent request or appeal. Alternate translation: “we apostles urge you to comfort … build up” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:11	fx2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οἰκοδομεῖτε	1	Paul speaks figuratively of the Thessalonian church as if they were a building that can be constructed. He means that they should mutually support one another in the Christian life.

5:11	kdae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἷς τὸν ἕνα	1	Here, the term **one the one** is an idiom meaning “each and every one” or “each one.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “each one” or “one another” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:11	sfv4			καθὼς καὶ ποιεῖτε	1	Here Paul uses the emphatic phrase **just as also you are doing** to encourage the Thessalonian church to continue their practice of mutually supporting each other. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “exactly as you have been doing”
5:12	pd47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	# General Information:\n\nHere, **Now** indicates that what follows is the final section of instructions from the apostles. Alternate translation: “Lastly” or “Indeed” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
5:12	fqh3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	τοὺς κοπιῶντας ἐν ὑμῖν, καὶ προϊσταμένους ὑμῶν ἐν Κυρίῳ, καὶ νουθετοῦντας ὑμᾶς	1	This clause expresses different functions for the same group of leaders. It is not making a distinction between **those who are laboring among you** and **leading you** and **admonishing you**. If this is not understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases more clear. Alternate translation: “your leaders who are working among you and guiding you in the Lord and training you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
5:12	f4jv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Paul speaks figuratively as if the leaders of the church at Thessalonica were occupying space inside of **the Lord**. Here, the metaphor expresses the idea that these men represent Jesus himself in their leadership role in the Thessalonian church (See also [4:1](../04/01.md). If your readers would not understand what **in the Lord** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “with authority from the Lord Jesus” or “as spokespersons for the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:13	jq0o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ ἡγεῖσθαι αὐτοὺς ὑπέρἐκπερισσοῦ ἐν ἀγάπῃ, διὰ τὸ ἔργον αὐτῶν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “and because of their work on your behalf, we also ask you to lovingly show them the utmost consideration” or “and since they work so hard for you, we also urge you to show them the highest honor out of love” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
5:13	p6m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ἀγάπῃ	1	Paul speaks figuratively as if the Thessalonian church is occupying space inside of **love**. He is describing how they should show honor to their leaders. If your readers would not understand what **in love** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Here, **in love** could refer to: (1) the means of love. Alternate translation: “by loving them” (2) the basis for love.

Alternate translation: “We urge you to continue to live peacefully with your leaders” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
5:14	lajk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	to regard them highly in love because of their work	0	Paul uses a repetitive series of imperative sentences in [5:14–22](../05/14) to urge the Thessalonian church to show practical love to one another. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone should do. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
5:14	tdxa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	παρακαλοῦμεν δὲ ὑμᾶς, ἀδελφοί,	1	This phrase signals the apostles’ final appeals to the Thessalonian church.

5:15	dqs8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κακὸν ἀντὶ κακοῦ τινι ἀποδῷ	1	Paul speaks figuratively of **evil** as if it were goods or money that could be exchanged. He means that if a someone treats you badly, you should not respond in the same way. If your readers would not understand what it means to **pay back evil for evil** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “treats anyone wrongly because they treated you wrongly” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:15	oz10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here what follows the word **but** is in contrast to repaying **evil for evil**.

Alternate translation (remove preceding comma): “for everyone” or “for each and every person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
5:15	i0jy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντας	1	Paul could be using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to describe a group of people.

Alternate translation: “In every circumstance and moment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:18	x2jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐν παντὶ εὐχαριστεῖτε;	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “Continue to give thanks in everything” or “Keep giving thanks all the time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
5:18	q7gn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐν παντὶ εὐχαριστεῖτε; τοῦτο γὰρ θέλημα Θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, **for** begins a reason clause. Paul is telling the Thessalonian church the reason why they should “rejoice,” “pray,” and **give thanks** in [5:16–18](../05/16.md)). If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Give thanks in everything, because all these things are what God desires for those who are united to Christ Jesus” or “Because this is God’s will for you who are united to Christ Jesus, you must give thanks in everything” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

5:18	yu36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	τοῦτο	1	A word is left out here in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, **is** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “this is” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
5:18	sw8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	θέλημα Θεοῦ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun phrase **the will of God in Christ Jesus for you**, you can express the idea it in another way. Alternate translation: “how God desires people to live who are united to Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
5:18	mbz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, Paul speaks figuratively of **the will of God** as though it were occupying space inside **Christ Jesus**. This metaphor means that the way God desires his people to live is inseparable from being united to **Christ Jesus** (See also [2:14](../02/14.md)). If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “for those of you who are united to Jesus Christ” or “for all of you who share life with Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:19	j1ei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ Πνεῦμα μὴ σβέννυτε	1	Paul speaks figuratively of **the** Holy **Spirit** as if he is fire that can be extinguished. Paul means that the Thessalonian church must not hinder the work of the Holy **Spirit**, especially by despising prophecies (See [5:20](../05/20.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to **quench** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Do not extinguish the Spirit” or “Do not reject the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:19	sv8r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μὴ σβέννυτε	1	Paul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

5:20	rrza		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	προφητείας μὴ ἐξουθενεῖτε	1	The two phrases in [5:19–20](../05/19.md) could refer to the same thing. Paul could be saying the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to correct how the Thessalonian church viewed prophecy. He means that the Holy Spirit is the source of true prophecy (See [2 Peter 1:21](2pet/01/21.md)), so they should not “quench the Spirit” by rejecting all prophecies. You could use a natural way in your language to emphasize this. Alternate translation: “Do not continue to despise prophetic messages from the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
5:21	ihzh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντα δοκιμάζετε; τὸ καλὸν κατέχετε	1	This could mean: (1) Paul is beginning a general list of things that the Thessalonians should **Test** and **Hold fast** if they are **good**.

5:21	wx69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντα δοκιμάζετε	1	Paul speaks figuratively as if the Thessalonians could make **all things** pass a test. This could mean: (1) they should examine everything they hear and do to make sure it conforms to what honors God. Alternate translation: “Carefully examine everything you hear and do” (2) they should examine and approve prophecies to determine whether or not they are genuinely from the Holy Spirit (See [2:4](../02/04.md) for a similar context)). Alternate translation: “examine and approve all prophecies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:21	sjh0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντα	1	Here, **all things** is an adjectival phrase. Depending on whether you decided this is a new list or a continuation of verse 20, this could mean: (1) Alternate translation: “everything you hear and do” (2) Alternate translation: “all prophesies” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
5:21	n1jv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ καλὸν κατέχετε	1	Paul speaks figuratively of **good** things as if they were objects that someone could hold tightly in his hands. He means that the Thessalonian church should only believe and practice things that prove to be from the Holy Spirit.

Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Keep only the valid things” or “Retain what is from the Spirit” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

5:22	z9k0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	παντὸς εἴδους πονηροῦ	1	Here, **evil** is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could be seen. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “anything clearly wicked” or “all that is obviously evil” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
5:23	mqi7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης ἁγιάσαι	1	Here, the verb forms indicate that this is a blessing or prayer (See also [3:11–13](../03/11.md)). Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing or prayer in your language. Alternate translation: “Now we pray that God himself, who gives peace, would sanctify” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
5:23	ozyh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἁγιάσαι ὑμᾶς ὁλοτελεῖς, καὶ ὁλόκληρον ὑμῶν τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ, καὶ τὸ σῶμα, ἀμέμπτως & τηρηθείη	1	These two clauses mean the same thing. Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show how much he wants God to preserve the Thessalonian church as his people. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “may … fully preserve you as his people to the end, and may every part of you be protected” or “may … completely preserve each and every one of you” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
5:23	sbxc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης	1	Here Paul uses the possessive form **the God of peace**, which is a title for God found in the New Testament (See Romans 15:33; 16:20; Philippians 4:9; Hebrews 13:20). If this is not clear in your language, you could make it explicit. In this context, **the God of peace** could refer to: (1) who God is. Alternate translation: “the God who is characterized by peace” (2) what God does. Alternate translation: “the God who gives peace” (3) Both. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
5:23	nb1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς	1	Paul uses the word **himself** to emphasize the urgency of the apostles’ prayer or blessing by drawing attention to **God**, who is the only one who can sanctify and keep the Christian person blameless. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
5:23	vkhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁλόκληρον ὑμῶν τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ, καὶ τὸ σῶμα, ἀμέμπτως & τηρηθείη.	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say **be kept** with an active form, and you could emphasize who did the action. Alternate translation: “may God keep you completely blameless” or “may God make your whole life sinless” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
5:23	s36k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ὁλόκληρον ὑμῶν τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ, καὶ τὸ σῶμα	1	Paul speaks figuratively, using these three aspects of the human person in order to represent the whole human being.

If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “when our Lord Jesus Christ comes back to earth again” or “at the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
5:24	i03k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πιστὸς ὁ καλῶν ὑμᾶς, ὃς καὶ ποιήσει	1	Here, **who will also do it** expresses the result of God’s faithfulness.
