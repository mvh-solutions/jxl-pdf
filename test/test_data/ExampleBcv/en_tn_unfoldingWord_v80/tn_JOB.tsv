Introduction (1:1–2:13)\n     - Background to Job’s situation: He is righteous and wealthy (1:1–5)\n     - Yahweh allows Satan to test Job (1:6–2:10)\n2. Job’s friends speak to him a first time and Job replies (3:1–14:22)\n3. Job’s friends speak to him a second time and Job replies (15:1–21:34)\n4. Job’s friends speak to him a third time and Job replies (22:1–31:40)\n5. Elihu speaks to Job (32:1–37:24)\n6. Yahweh answers Job out of the whirlwind (38:1–41:34) \n7. Conclusion (42:1–17)\n     - Job responds humbly\n     - Yahweh rebukes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar (42:7–9)\n     - Yahweh restores Job to prosperity (42:10–17)\n\n### What is the book of Job about?\n\nThe book of Job is about a man named Job who experienced disaster even though he was faithful to Yahweh. Job speaks with three friends and asks why Yahweh has allowed him to experience trials and losses. The book teaches that we cannot understand all of Yahweh’s ways, and when we suffer, it is more important to trust Yahweh than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.\n\n### What title should translators give to this book?\n\nThe book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word “job.” Translators might use the traditional title of “The Book of Job” or simply “Job.” Or they may choose a different title such as “The Book About Job” or “The Book About a Man Named Job.”\n\n### Who wrote the book of Job?\n\nWe do not know who wrote the book of Job. Many people suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but it may have been written after the time of Moses.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Does sin cause suffering?\n\nWhen a person sins against Yahweh, that can cause the person to experience suffering. People in the ancient Near East generally believed that a person suffered because they or their ancestors had sinned against God. This is what many religions teach. However, the book of Job shows that a person may suffer even if he or she has not sinned. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar really Job’s friends?\n\nJob 2:11 describes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar as the friends of Job. However, they did not succeed in comforting Job. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that Job believed was not true. So we might wonder if it is right to translate the word as “friends.” What they said did not help Job, because they did not understand the full truth about God. However, they did care about Job, and they did want to help him. In those ways, they did what friends would do, and in that sense the word “friends” is appropriate.\n\n### When did the events in the book of Job take place?\n\nWe do not know when the events in the book of Job took place. The story is set around the time of Abraham and Isaac in the book of Genesis. However, some verses are similar to verses in the books of Proverbs and Isaiah, which were written many centuries after Abraham and Isaac lived. It is possible that the book of Job was written at a later time to describe the events of an earlier time.\n\n### The “sea monster”\n\nAncient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean. They referred to it as the “sea monster.” People in Job's culture regarded the sea as the realm of watery chaos, and they associated this sea monster with that chaos. There are references to this creature in the book of Job under the names Leviathan in [3:8](../03/08.md), the “sea monster” in [7:12](../07/12.md), Rahab in [9:13](../09/13.md) and [26:12](../26/12.md), and the “fleeing serpent” in [26:13](../26/13.md). The description of Leviathan in chapter 41 also seems to be a description of this same creature. Notes at these various places suggest how you might represent these references in your translation.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Is the book of Job difficult to translate?\n\nThe book of Job has many uncommon words and phrases. That makes parts of it hard to understand and translate. For this reason, translators may decide to translate this book after they have translated other books of the Bible. However, since the writer did not connect Job with a specific time or place in history, the translator may also decide to translate this book before other Old Testament books.\n\n### What style of writing is in the book of Job?\n\nThe author begins and ends the book of Job by relating what happened to Job in narrative form. In the rest of the book, the characters speak in poetry. In the ancient Near East, writers often used poetry to discuss matters of wisdom. The relationship of human conduct to human prosperity and suffering is an important theme in wisdom literature.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: parallelism\n\nHebrew poetry was based on repetition of meaning rather than on repetition of sound like poetry in some other languages. A speaker would typically say one phrase and then say another phrase (or two) that meant a similar thing, an opposite thing, or something supplementary. The subsequent phrase or phrases would advance the meaning of the first phrase in one of these ways. In many cases it would be good to show this to your readers by including all the phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that would show how the later phrase or phrases are advancing the meaning of the first one. Throughout the book, notes will model ways of doing this in various cases, although not in most cases. It is hoped that these illustrations will give translators an idea of what they could do in any given instance.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry often uses a form known as “chiasm.” It will make a statement consisting of two elements. It will then make a parallel, contrasting, or supplemental statement consisting of those same two elements, but in reverse order. For example, Job says in 3:5:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\ninto the number of the months may it not come.\n\nYou may wish to show this form in your translation by following the Hebrew word order, even if that would not ordinarily be the order you would follow in your language. For 3:5, English might ordinarily say:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\nmay it not come into the number of the months.\n\nBut the ULT follows the Hebrew word order in order to give an idea of this characteristic form of Hebrew poetry.\n\n### “answered and said”\n\nThe author uses the phrase “answered and said” many times in the book of Job. This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and”. The word “answered” tells for what purpose a person “said” something. Specifically, they said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and,” such as “responded.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])\n\n### “fear”\n\nIn several places in the book, the author uses a word from the root “fear,” such as the verb “fear” or the adjective “fearful,” in a specific sense. He uses the word to describe an awe of God that leads to holy living. He is not referring to an emotion and saying that the person is afraid of God. He means that the person respects and obeys God. Notes will call attention to this usage where it occurs, and they will suggest translations such as the verb “respect” and the adjective “respectful.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “behold”\n\nIn many places in the book, characters use the term “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation in these instances.\n\n### “nose”\n\nIn several places in the book, various characters use the term “nose” to mean anger. They do this by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language and say “anger.”
1:intro	lym1				0	# Job 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lived during a time long before the author.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Wealth\n\nIn the time and place in which the book of Job is set, a person’s wealth was measured by the number of animals he owned. The book describes how Job owned thousands of animals in order to indicate that he was very rich. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Sacrifices\n\nJob was a man who obeyed Yahweh carefully. We might therefore wonder why he offered sacrifices on behalf of his children, as 1:5 describes, since he was not one of the descendants of Aaron, who were the only ones whom the law of Moses allowed to offer sacrifices. It must be remembered that Job lived prior to the time when God gave Moses the law, so his religious practices were different from those of the Hebrew people after Moses. In Job’s culture, it was normal and acceptable for the father to act as a priest for his family and to offer sacrifices on their behalf. The events that this book relates took place about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12–50 than with the rest of the Old Testament. (See:[[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “the adversary”\n\nThe Hebrew word satan means “adversary.” The Old Testament uses the word in that sense in several places, for example, 1 Kings 11:14, “Yahweh raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.” In chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job, there is a character called “the satan” or “the adversary.” This seems to be a created angelic being who opposes righteous people and accuses them before God of having wrong motives. Many interpreters of the book of Job identify this character with Satan, the devil. The UST follows that interpretation, but the ULT translates the term more basically as “adversary.” You can decide how to translate this term in your own translation.
1:1	j000		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִ֛ישׁ הָיָ֥ה בְ⁠אֶֽרֶץ־ע֖וּץ	1	The author is introducing **Job** as the main participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who lived in the land of Uz”
1:1	k5g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ע֖וּץ & אִיּ֣וֹב	1	The word **Uz** is the name of a place, and the word **Job** is the name of a man.
1:1	r5aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	The terms **blameless** and **righteous** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very righteous”
1:1	qj15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וִ⁠ירֵ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, here as in several other places in the book, the author is using a word from the root “fear,” in this case the word **fearful**, in a particular sense. He is describing an awe of God that leads to holy living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “both respectful of God”
1:1	y3ar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠סָ֥ר מֵ⁠רָֽע	1	The author is speaking figuratively of Job as if he physically **turned** away from evil. He means that he did not live in an evil way but instead lived in the right way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and careful not to do anything wrong”
1:2	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	Here and through verse 5, the author is introducing background information about **Job** that will help readers understand what happens later in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:2	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Job had seven sons and three daughters”
1:3	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The expression **sons of** describes people who share a certain quality. In this case, the author is using the expression to describe people who have the quality of living in **the East**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in the East”
1:3	csw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The author is referring to an area to the **East** of where he and his audience live. It seems probable that he may mean the area east of the Jordan River, as the UST suggests. However, since it is not known exactly where the author and his audience lived, you could also use a general expression rather than try to identify the area in your translation. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in that area”
1:4	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָלְכ֤וּ בָנָי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠עָשׂ֣וּ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה בֵּ֖ית אִ֣ישׁ יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the expression **went and** to describe customary action. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His sons had the custom of taking turns hosting feasts in their homes”
1:4	i4lf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) Alternate translation: “on an assigned day of the week” (2) Alternate translation: “on his birthday”
1:4	ey91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠שָׁלְח֗וּ וְ⁠קָרְאוּ֙	1	The terms **sent** and **called** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and they invited”
1:5	s2c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֣י הִקִּיפֽוּ֩ יְמֵ֨י הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֜ה	1	The author is speaking as if the **days of the feast** had literally **gone around** or traveled a certain distance and then returned to their starting point. He means that each son had taken his turn hosting a feast. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “after the days of the feast had made a full circuit” or “after each son had taken his turn hosting a feast”
1:5	x3v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָנַ֔⁠י	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is likely using the word in a generic sense to refer to all of his sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, as the UST does, or you could mention both sons and daughters. Alternate translation: “my sons and daughters”
1:5	k14m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	 וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	It is possible that the original reading here was “cursed” and that scribes changed it to **blessed** in order to avoid the uncomfortable language of a person cursing God. Traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible do not have a marginal notation about this as they do in the case of [7:20](../07/20.md), but many translations read “cursed” since this is the kind of change that scribes are known to have made in similar cases. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT. Alternate translation: “and cursed”
1:5	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	חָטְא֣וּ & וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **sinned** tells in what way one of Job’s children might have **blessed**, that is, “cursed” God. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “have sinfully cursed”
1:5	du2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “in their thoughts”
1:5	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הַ⁠יָּמִֽים	1	The author says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “on a regular basis”
1:6	i5iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨אוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day the sons of God came”
1:6	n2re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	This expression describes spiritual beings whom God created. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the angelic beings”
1:6	uwv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠הִתְיַצֵּ֖ב עַל־יְהוָ֑ה	1	The context suggests that these angelic beings came to Yahweh at regular times to report on their activities. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to give Yahweh a regular report on their activities”
1:6	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠שָּׂטָ֖ן	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter for how to translate the title **the adversary** here and in the rest of this chapter and in chapter 2. Alternate translation, as in UST: “Satan”
1:7	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן הַ⁠שָּׂטָ֤ן אֶת־יְהוָה֙ וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, this phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose the adversary **said** this. If it would be more natural in your language, here and in the rest of the book you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “The adversary responded to Yahweh”
1:7	plj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מִ⁠שּׁ֣וּט בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠הִתְהַלֵּ֖ךְ בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. The adversary is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them and convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “From wandering all over the earth”
1:8	s9h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠שַׂ֥מְתָּ לִבְּ⁠ךָ֖ עַל	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and perceptions. Alternate translation: “Have you considered”
1:8	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵ֤ין כָּמֹ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	This expression leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “there is not anyone like him”
1:8	ncu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	See how you translated this expression in [1:1](../01/01.md).

1:9	i5tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַֽ⁠חִנָּ֔ם יָרֵ֥א אִיּ֖וֹב אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Job gets a lot in return for fearing God!”
1:9	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is speaking about God in the third person, even though he is addressing him directly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “you”
1:10	f5z2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have put a hedge around him and around his house and around all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	r7xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is speaking as if God had literally **put a hedge** around Job and his possessions. He means that God has protected Job and all that he owns. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Have you not protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side?” or “You have protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	j012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	 מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙ בֵּרַ֔כְתָּ וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ׃	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “His cattle have burst forth in the land because you have blessed the works of his hands”
1:10	l9et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙	1	The adversary is using one part of Job, **his hands**, to mean all of Job in the act of doing **works**, specifically the activity of raising cattle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everything he has done”
1:10	xg3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	The adversary is speaking as if Job’s **cattle** have literally **burst forth** and covered **the land** as if they were floodwaters. He means that Job’s cattle have increased greatly in number. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his herds of cattle have become very large”
1:11	k6w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	שְֽׁלַֽח־נָ֣א יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠גַ֖ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֑⁠וֹ אִם־לֹ֥א עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The terms **stretch out** and **touch** are imperatives, but they communicate an assertion rather than commands. Use a form in your language that communicates an assertion. Alternate translation: “if you stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, he will bless you to your face”
1:11	y4qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְֽׁלַֽח&  יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “use your power”
1:11	ax31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠גַ֖ע	1	In this context, the word **touch** means “destroy.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and destroy”
1:11	j013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם	1	The adversary is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and see if”
1:11	j014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	See how you translated the word “blessed’ in verse 5. Scribes may have made a similar change here from “curse” to **bless**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT. Alternate translation: “he will … curse you”
1:11	bn3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The claim is that Job would not curse God in his “heart” (that is, in his thoughts) as Job was afraid one of his children might have done. Rather, Job would curse God out loud, and since God is present everywhere, Job would be cursing him in person. Alternate translation: “in person”
1:12	d2uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֤ה	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, Yahweh is using the term **Behold** to focus the adversary’s attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation.
1:12	bul4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is in your power” or “is under your control”
1:12	j015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תִּשְׁלַ֖ח יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse.
1:12	gn4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פְּנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	As in the previous verse, here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “the presence of Yahweh”
1:13	j016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֖י הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם וּ⁠בָנָ֨י⁠ו וּ⁠בְנֹתָ֤י⁠ו	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day Job’s sons and daughters”
1:14	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	הַ⁠בָּקָר֙ הָי֣וּ חֹֽרְשׁ֔וֹת וְ⁠הָ⁠אֲתֹנ֖וֹת רֹע֥וֹת עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The messenger is giving background information to help Job understand what he reports next. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:14	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	This expression uses the word **hand** to mean the side of a person, animal, or group of animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at their side” or “next to them”

3:intro	jci9				0	# Job 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Birth meaning life by association\n\nThroughout this chapter, Job is saying that does not feel that his life is worth living any longer. He communicates this by cursing the day he was born, which is a way of saying by association that he wishes he had never lived. This is a powerful poetic device that would be good to show to your readers, so it would be preferable to translate the device itself, rather than express only its meaning or implications in your translation. In other words, for example, it would be appropriate to translate Job’s actual words in 3:3, “May the day on which I was born perish,” rather than have him say something like, “I do not feel that my life is worth living any more, and so I wish I had never been born.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

3:1	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְקַלֵּ֖ל אֶת־יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that Job **cursed** his birthday because he was suffering so greatly that he wished he had never been born. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and cursed his birthday because he was suffering so greatly that he wished he had never been born”
3:2	j045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַן אִיּ֗וֹב וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	See the discussion of this expression in the General Introduction to Job. In this case, Job is responding not to something that someone else said but to all that has happened to him. Alternate translation: “In response to all that had happened to him, Job said”
3:3	j046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	יֹ֣אבַד י֭וֹם אִוָּ֣לֶד בּ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠הַ⁠לַּ֥יְלָה אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	See the discussion of Hebrew poetry in the General Introduction to Job to decide how to approach the translation of this verse and the other verses in the book that consist of a statement and then one or two further statements that advance the meaning of the first one in some way. Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born perish, yes, may the night perish that said a boy had been conceived” or “May the night I was conceived and the day on which I was born both perish”
3:3	z3eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יֹ֣אבַד י֭וֹם אִוָּ֣לֶד בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of the **day** on which he **was born** as if it were a living thing that could **perish**. It is clear from verse 6 that he means he wishes it would no longer be one of the days of the year. Your language may have an expression of its own that you could use to express this meaning in your translation. Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	zca2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הַ⁠לַּ֥יְלָה	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and may the night perish” or “and may the night also be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “that said that a boy had been conceived”
3:3	q9nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	Job is speaking of the **night** of his conception as if it were a living thing that could speak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on which I was conceived as a boy”
3:3	ka1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “A woman has conceived a boy”
3:4	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַֽל־יִדְרְשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְ⁠אַל־תּוֹפַ֖ע עָלָ֣י⁠ו נְהָרָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **seek** the day of his birth after it became dark. In this context, the word **seek** could mean: (1) to show concern. Alternate translation: “May God not show concern from above for that day by restoring its light” (2) to look for. Alternate translation: “May God not search for that day from above when he discovers that it is missing and bring it back among the other days by restoring its light”
3:4	hr5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַֽל־יִדְרְשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְ⁠אַל־תּוֹפַ֖ע עָלָ֣י⁠ו נְהָרָֽה	1	Since it was God who created day by making light ([Genesis 1:3](../01/03.md)), Job seems to be wishing that his birthday would be dark because God would not provide any light for it. Alternate translation: “May God not care for it from above, and as a result, may light not shine upon it” or “May no light shine upon it, because God is not caring for it from above”
3:5	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	The terms **darkness** and **dark shadow** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “May darkness completely claim it”
3:5	j050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **claim** he is referring to the way, in his culture, a close relative would bring an orphaned child into his own home and make that child a member of his own family. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “May darkness and deep darkness make it part of their own family”
3:5	j051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job is speaking as if **darkness** and a **dark shadow** were living things that could adopt the day of his birth, as if it too were a living thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May that day be just like darkness, yes, like deep darkness”
3:5	ci87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תִּשְׁכָּן־עָלָ֣י⁠ו עֲנָנָ֑ה	1	Job is speaking of a **cloud** as if it were a living thing that could **dwell** or make its home **over** the day of his birth, and he is speaking of that day as if it were something that itself lived in a particular place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may that whole day be cloudy”
3:5	tz1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	In this possessive form, **the day** is the object rather than the subject of **blacknesses**. That is, this does not mean blacknesses that the day possesses, it means all the things that blacken a day, that is, make it dark. This would include things such as eclipses, sand storms, volcanic eruptions, etc. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	If your language would not use an abstract noun such as **blacknesses**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j4if		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְ֝בַעֲתֻ֗⁠הוּ	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that blackening events could **terrify**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “make it so dark that it is no longer truly a day”
3:6	g44b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִקָּחֵ֪⁠ה֫וּ אֹ֥פֶל	1	Job is speaking of **gloom** as if it were a living thing that could **take** away the night of his conception, as if it were an object that could be carried. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may it be without any light”
3:6	j053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the day when Job was born. Job is alternating between speaking about that day and about the night when he was conceived. Alternate translation: “May the day when I was born not rejoice among the days of the year; into the number of the months may it not come”
3:6	hgn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that could **rejoice** that it was one of the days of the year and that could **come** among the months of the year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year, yes, may it not be a day in any of the months”
3:6	d2mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is not saying that he does not want the day of his birth to be one of the months of the year. Rather, he is using the possessive form **the number of the months** to mean the group of all of the months. In other words, that is another way of saying “the year.” Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year; indeed, may it not be part of the year at all” or, combining the two phrases, “May that day be left out of the year completely”
3:6	j054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	It may be more natural in your language to mention the shorter period, **months**, before the longer period, **the year**, in order to increase the emphasis as the sentence progresses. The UST models one way to do this.
3:7	sh3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הַ⁠לַּ֣יְלָה הַ֭⁠הוּא יְהִ֣י גַלְמ֑וּד	1	Job is speaking of the **night** he was conceived as if it were a living thing that could be **barren**. He means that he does not want that night to have any children, in the sense that he does not want any more children to be conceived on that night or, as the context suggests, born on that night. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one ever again be born on that night”
3:7	i8zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־תָּבֹ֖א רְנָנָ֣ה בֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a **joyful shout** as if it were a living thing that could **come into** a place. He is referring to people shouting for joy on the night of the day when he was born. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one shout joyfully on that night”
3:7	cdr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל־תָּבֹ֖א רְנָנָ֣ה בֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job means implicitly that he does not want anyone to shout joyfully on this particular night to celebrate the birth of a child. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one shout joyfully on that night to celebrate the birth of a child”
3:8	j055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִקְּבֻ֥⁠הוּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the day when Job was born. Job is alternating between speaking about that day and about the night when he was conceived. Alternate translation: “May … curse that day”
3:8	i4gt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹרְרֵי־י֑וֹם	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **the ones cursing a day** he is referring to sorcerers. People in this culture employed sorcerers in the belief that they could cause bad things to happen on a particular day to their enemies. For example, people might employ a sorcerer to try to ruin the day on which a person began an important journey or celebrated an important family occasion such as a wedding. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “professional sorcerers”
3:8	j056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הָ֝⁠עֲתִידִ֗ים	1	Job is using the adjective **skillful** as a noun to mean certain people. The word is plural, and the ULT adds the word **ones** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the people who have the skill”
3:8	j057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹרֵ֥ר לִוְיָתָֽן	1	The implication is that if sorcerers created chaos by awakening the chaos monster, there would no longer be any distinction between days, and so the day of Job’s birth would no longer have a distinct identity. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to cause chaos among days” or “to destroy the distinct identity of the day on which I was born”
3:8	j342		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִוְיָתָֽן	1	As the General Introduction to Job explains, ancient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean, which they called the “sea monster.” People in Job's culture regarded the sea as the realm of watery chaos, and they associated this sea monster with that chaos. That is the association that Job is making here, calling the sea monster by the name Leviathan. You could retain the name Leviathan in your translation. Alternatively, you could use a general expression to convey the idea here. Alternate translation: “the sea monster that is associated with chaos”
3:9	fcl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְקַו־לְ⁠א֥וֹר וָ⁠אַ֑יִן וְ⁠אַל־יִ֝רְאֶ֗ה בְּ⁠עַפְעַפֵּי־שָֽׁחַר	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that could **wait** for **light** to appear in the sky and **see** the **dawn**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may light never appear on that day, yes, may dawn never break on that day”
3:9	j058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עַפְעַפֵּי־שָֽׁחַר	1	Job is referring to light flashing from eyes by association with the **eyelids** that open to reveal that flashing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the light flashing from the eyes of the dawn”
3:9	max2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בְּ⁠עַפְעַפֵּי־שָֽׁחַר	1	Job is speaking of **the dawn** as if it were a living thing that had **eyelids** that could open to reveal light flashing from its eyes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. By **dawn**, Job means the sunrise itself, not the first faint light that appears on the horizon to indicate that a new day is beginning. Alternate translation: “the first flashes of light from the sunrise”
3:10	j059		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	לֹ֣א סָ֭גַר דַּלְתֵ֣י בִטְנִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the possessive form **my womb** to mean the womb from which he was born, that is, his mother’s womb. He is not saying that he himself had a womb. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “it did not close the doors of my mother’s womb”
3:10	ta9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֣א סָ֭גַר דַּלְתֵ֣י בִטְנִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as his mother’s **womb** literally had **doors** that could have **closed** to keep him from being born. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it did not keep me from being born”
3:10	juv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לֹ֣א סָ֭גַר דַּלְתֵ֣י בִטְנִ֑⁠י וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר	1	Job is speaking as if the day of his birth were a living thing that could have kept him from being born. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “nothing kept me from being born on that day and hid”
3:10	j060		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	Job is also speaking as if the day of his birth were a living thing that could have hidden **trouble** from his **eyes**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and nothing hid trouble from my eyes”
3:10	e47i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	Job is referring to his ability to see by association with the **eyes** by which he sees. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and hide trouble from my sight” or “and keep me from seeing trouble”
3:10	j061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	In this context, to see **trouble** means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and keep me from experiencing trouble”
3:10	j062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **trouble**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and keep me from suffering so badly”
3:11	j063		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	לָ֤⁠מָּה לֹּ֣א מֵ⁠רֶ֣חֶם אָמ֑וּת מִ⁠בֶּ֖טֶן יָצָ֣אתִי וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	These two phrases mean similar things. As Job and the other characters do throughout the poetic sections of the book, here he is using repeating phrases in order to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. (See the discussion of “parallelism” in the General Introduction to the book of Job.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases. However, you may wish to retain both of them in order to give your readers an idea of how Hebrew poetry worked. The following notes give suggestions for how to do that. Alternate translation, combining the phrases: “Why did I not die just as soon as I was born?”
3:11	gg8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֤⁠מָּה לֹּ֣א מֵ⁠רֶ֣חֶם אָמ֑וּת מִ⁠בֶּ֖טֶן יָצָ֣אתִי וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate using the statement or exclamation form. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “I wish I had died from the womb! I wish I had come out of the belly and expired!”
3:11	j064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠רֶ֣חֶם	1	Job is referring to his birth by association with the **womb** from which he was born. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as soon as I was born”
3:11	hh1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	Job is using the word **expire**, which means to “breathe out,” to mean “die.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and pass away”
3:11	j065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠בֶּ֖טֶן יָצָ֣אתִי וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	Job is referring to his birth by association with the **belly** (a poetic synonym for “womb”) from which he was born. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “breathe my last as soon as my mother gave birth to me”
3:12	j066		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַ֭דּוּעַ קִדְּמ֣וּ⁠נִי בִרְכָּ֑יִם וּ⁠מַה־שָּׁ֝דַ֗יִם כִּ֣י אִינָֽק	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I wish that knees had not welcomed me, and breasts, that I should have sucked!”
3:12	j067		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מַ֭דּוּעַ קִדְּמ֣וּ⁠נִי בִרְכָּ֑יִם וּ⁠מַה־שָּׁ֝דַ֗יִם כִּ֣י אִינָֽק	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Why did knees welcome me, and why did breasts welcome me so that I could suck?”
3:12	v9p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מַ֭דּוּעַ קִדְּמ֣וּ⁠נִי בִרְכָּ֑יִם וּ⁠מַה־שָּׁ֝דַ֗יִם כִּ֣י אִינָֽק	1	Job is using parts of his mother to mean all of his mother in the act of nursing him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Why did my mother hold me on her knees and nurse me?”
3:13	aal1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	כִּֽי	1	The word **For** indicates that the sentence it introduces states what the result would have been if the event Job has been describing had actually taken place, that is, if he had died at birth. Alternate translation: “If that had been the case,”
3:13	j068			עַ֭תָּה	1	Alternate translation: “by now” or “at this time”
3:13	pv57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	שָׁכַ֣בְתִּי וְ⁠אֶשְׁק֑וֹט יָ֝שַׁ֗נְתִּי אָ֤ז ׀ יָנ֬וּחַֽ לִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the past tense to describe what would have been the case if he had actually never been born. Your language may use the past tense in this same way. If not, you could use the conditional tense here. Alternate translation: “I would have lain down and been reposing, I would have slept and it would have been rest to me”
3:13	j069		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יָ֝שַׁ֗נְתִּי	1	Job is using the word **slept** to mean “died.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. If not, you could state the meaning plainly.

3:13	e4ks			יָנ֬וּחַֽ לִֽ⁠י	1	If your language would not use an impersonal construction such as this one, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “I would have been at rest” or “I would have been resting”
3:14	j070		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠בֹּנִ֖ים חֳרָב֣וֹת לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	The word translated **monuments** refers to a desolate or ruined place. In this context, it could mean implicitly: (1) elaborate buildings in desolate places, such as the pyramids that the pharaohs built in the Egyptian desert. Since Job is wishing that this were his situation, this positive sense is probably preferable. Alternate translation: “who built great tombs for themselves in remote places” (2) ruined buildings. Alternate translation: “who rebuilt ruined buildings for themselves” or “who built buildings for themselves that are now ruined”
3:15	j071		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	הַֽ⁠מְמַלְאִ֖ים בָּתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם כָּֽסֶף	1	Job says that these princes **filled their houses with silver** as an overstatement for emphasis.

3:16	j072		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְ⁠נֵ֣פֶל טָ֭מוּן	1	The word translated **hidden** refers implicitly to burial.

3:17	j073		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְ֭שָׁעִים & יְגִ֣יעֵי כֹֽחַ	1	Job is using the adjectives **wicked** and **weary** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “people who are wicked … people who are weary in strength”
3:18	zbk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹ֥א שָׁ֝מְע֗וּ ק֣וֹל נֹגֵֽשׂ	1	Job is referring to the orders that a **taskmaster** would give **Captives** by association with the **voice** that the taskmaster would use to convey them. He is referring to the captives’ obligation to obey those orders by association with the way they would **hear** them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent expressions or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no taskmaster gives them orders to follow” or “they no longer need to follow the orders of any taskmaster”
3:19	yv5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	קָטֹ֣ן וְ֭⁠גָדוֹל שָׁ֣ם	1	Job is using two extremes of people, **small** and **great** (meaning unimportant and important), to mean them and everyone in between.

3:19	xrv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠עֶ֗בֶד	1	In this context, the phrase **a servant** does not refer to one specific person. It refers to servants in general. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and anyone who had been a servant”
3:20	zq45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֤⁠מָּה יִתֵּ֣ן לְ⁠עָמֵ֣ל א֑וֹר וְ֝⁠חַיִּ֗ים לְ⁠מָ֣רֵי נָֽפֶשׁ	1	This is the beginning of a long question that Job asks, using the question form for emphasis, in verses 20–23. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these verses as a series of statements or exclamations.

4:intro	kk87				0	# Job 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter (and the next chapter), Job’s friend Eliphaz responds to what Job said in chapter 3.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Eliphaz’s advice\n\nEliphaz advises Job to trust that God protects innocent people and punishes wicked people. He says that God corrects good people if they begin to do bad things, and he encourages Job to consider why God is correcting him. Ordinarily this would be very good advice. But Eliphaz does not understand the special circumstances that Job is in. Job himself does not understand them. God cannot explain to Job that he has allowed the adversary to test him to see whether he will still trust God even if he loses his family, possessions, and health, because if God explained this, that would make the test invalid. So this section of the book, in which Job’s three friends speak with him, presents a paradox: What would ordinarily be good advice is not good advice under these special circumstances.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nEliphaz often uses the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate his questions as statements or exclamations. Notes will offer suggestions at each place where Eliphaz uses the question form in this way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job’s friend Eliphaz.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### long sentence\nEliphaz describes God in a long sentence in verses 8–13. As the notes suggest at several places, it may be helpful to break up this long sentence into several shorter sentences.
5:1	j114		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz is using the word translated **now** to offer polite encouragement. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call out”
5:1	j115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **Call out**, he is telling Job to ask someone to listen to his complaint against God. In this culture, someone who had a case against someone else would go to a public area and ask established members of the community to hear and judge the case. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”
5:1	j116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz does not really want Job to **Call out** and ask someone to hear his complaint against God, even though he is telling Job to do that.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations.

5:1	n2rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠קְּדֹשִׁ֣ים	1	In this context, the phrase **the holy ones** likely refers to angelic beings rather than to people who live righteously.

5:1	j117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּפְנֶֽה	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job would literally **turn** to face someone whom he wanted to hear his case against God. Eliphaz means that Job would appeal to such a person, although he is arguing that there actually is no such person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will you appeal”
5:2	j118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he does not really think that Job should look for someone to judge his complaint against God.

Alternate translation: “when people foolishly become indignant or naïvely become resentful when God corrects them, God must punish or even kill them”
5:2	j119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָּ֑עַשׂ & קִנְאָֽה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **indignation** and **resentment**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “being indignant … being resentful”

Your language may have a term with this meaning that you could use in your translation.
5:3	j121		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲֽנִי־רָ֭אִיתִי	1	For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **have seen**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here. Other languages may have other ways of expressing this emphasis. The ULT does so by saying **I myself**. Alternate translation: “I have indeed seen”

5:4	ep6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין מַצִּֽיל	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that there is no one **rescuing** these children from legal defeats and their consequences.

5:5	j125		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר קְצִיר֨⁠וֹ ׀ רָ֘עֵ֤ב יֹאכֵ֗ל	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **devours the harvest** he is referring to the practice of gleaning, which the law of Moses commanded the Israelites to allow. Poor people could come into harvested fields and pick up the leftover grain to feed themselves. Eliphaz means that the foolish person and his family will not be able to harvest the grain they have planted and so gleaners will come and take all the grain. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

5:5	j127		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רָ֘עֵ֤ב & צַמִּ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is using the adjectives **hungry** and **thirsty** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people.

Alternate translation: “the hungry person … thirsty people”
5:5	j128		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רָ֘עֵ֤ב & צַמִּ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is describing poor people by association with the way that they may be **hungry** and **thirsty** because they cannot afford to buy food and drink.

5:5	j129		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	רָ֘עֵ֤ב יֹאכֵ֗ל	1	This phrase does not refer to a specific person. It refers to anyone who has the quality that it names.

Alternate translation: “hungry people devour” or “poor people devour”
5:5	k9ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶֽל־מִ⁠צִּנִּ֥ים יִקָּחֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	The implications are that if gleaners even collect the grain that is growing **among the thorns** in the foolish person’s field, then they will take all of the grain in the entire field.

Alternate translation: “they take every last bit of grain, leaving nothing for him and his family”

He means that they desire the wealth. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and impoverished people desire their wealth”
5:5	j130		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠שָׁאַ֖ף צַמִּ֣ים חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is saying by implication that the **thirsty ones** who desire the **wealth** of foolish people actually do obtain it.

He is comparing them to plants such as weeds that might unexpectedly appear in the soil even though a farmer did not sow their seeds. The point of the comparison is that weeds seem to come out of nowhere, while trouble and misery have an identifiable source. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, combining the two parallel lines: “trouble certainly does not just happen”
5:6	j132		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 לֹא־יֵצֵ֣א מֵ⁠עָפָ֣ר אָ֑וֶן וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠אֲדָמָ֗ה לֹא־יִצְמַ֥ח עָמָֽל׃	1	The implication, if trouble and misery do not just happen, is that their cause is the indignation and resentment that Eliphaz warned Job against in verse 2. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation, as a poetic parallel: “it is truly indignation that causes trouble, yes, it is resentment that causes misery”
5:7	j133		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he says that trouble does not just happen.

Alternate translation: “people have an innate tendency to cause trouble for themselves”
5:7	j136		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֵי־רֶ֝֗שֶׁף	1	Eliphaz is describing sparks as if they were **sons of the flame**, that is, as if fire gave birth to sparks and sent them out. Your language may have a poetic expression of its own that you could use in your translation to describe sparks. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and sparks”
5:7	j137		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַגְבִּ֥יהוּ עֽוּף	1	This expression means that sparks fly upwards, carried by currents of air. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “fly upwards”

6:intro	r7kh				0	# Job 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJob uses many different metaphors in this chapter to express his pain or despair and to show that he is upset with his friends, people who are supposed to help him during difficult times. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n\nIn verses 16–20, Job develops the image of his friends being like a stream of water that runs dry. Since Job explains the meaning of the image again in verse 21, you do not need to explain it in your translation in verses 16–20.\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJob often uses the question form in this chapter to make emphatic statements or exclamations. This emphasis helps strengthen Job’s response to Eliphaz. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### plural “you”\n\nBeginning in verse 21, Job addresses his friends directly. So when he uses the word **you** from that verse to the end of the chapter, the word is plural. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

It consists of a central post with a crossbar from which two pans are hung. An object may be placed in one pan and known weights placed in the other pan until the crossbar remains level, meaning that both pans contain an equal weight. Or one object may be placed in one pan and a different object in the other pan; the pan that hangs lower contains the heavier object. If your readers would not be familiar with what **balances** are, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression.

6:2	j184		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שָׁק֣וֹל יִשָּׁקֵ֣ל	1	The words **were thoroughly weighed** translate a repeated verb. Job is repeating the verb “weigh” for emphasis.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God is doing many things that all terrify me”
6:5	vas3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יִֽנְהַק־פֶּ֥רֶא עֲלֵי־דֶ֑שֶׁא אִ֥ם יִגְעֶה־שּׁ֝֗וֹר עַל־בְּלִילֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis in both of these sentences. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “A wild donkey does not bray over grass! Indeed, an ox does not bellow over its fodder!”
6:5	kn3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֥ם יִגְעֶה־שּׁ֝֗וֹר עַל־בְּלִילֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “An ox does not bellow over its fodder, does it?”
6:5	j186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	הֲ⁠יִֽנְהַק־פֶּ֥רֶא עֲלֵי־דֶ֑שֶׁא אִ֥ם יִגְעֶה־שּׁ֝֗וֹר עַל־בְּלִילֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as animals do not complain loudly if they have food, so Job would not be protesting so vehemently if something were not seriously wrong. But since Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If your readers would not recognize what a **wild donkey** or an **ox** is, in your translation you could use animals that your readers would recognize.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “The unsavory will not be eaten without salt! And there is no taste in the white of an egg!”
6:6	l3sd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח אִם־יֶשׁ־טַ֝֗עַם בְּ⁠רִ֣יר חַלָּמֽוּת	1	Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as it is necessary to season some foods in order to eat them, so it is necessary to talk expressively about some situations in life in order to endure them. Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), but perhaps the connection will not be as clear in this case as in the previous verse. So you could make the connection more explicitly. Alternatively, you could translate the proverb itself in a way that would be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If people in your culture would not eat **the white of an egg**, in your translation you could use a food that your readers would recognize. Alternate translation: “I cannot endure these troubles without talking emotionally about them, any more than people can eat bland food without seasoning it”
6:6	j187		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח	1	Job is using the adjective **unsavory,** which in this context means “without flavor,” as a noun to mean a certain kind of food. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Will unsavory food be eaten without salt” 
6:6	xfj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Will people eat unsavory food without salt”
6:6	j188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־יֶשׁ־טַ֝֗עַם בְּ⁠רִ֣יר חַלָּמֽוּת	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer.

6:7	j189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מֵאֲנָ֣ה & נַפְשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have refused”
6:7	j190		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לִ⁠נְגּ֣וֹעַ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Job is moving from quoting a proverb that uses food as an illustration to talking about his actual food. Alternate translation: “to touch food”
6:7	hy2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠נְגּ֣וֹעַ	1	In this context, the word **touch** means “eat.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to eat food”
6:7	j191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֵ֝֗מָּה	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the troubles that Job has been experiencing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my troubles”
6:7	j192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כִּ⁠דְוֵ֥י לַחְמִֽ⁠י	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **disease** can make a person feel too badly to eat, so Job’s troubles are making him feel too badly to eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “are making me feel too badly to eat, as if I were sick”
6:7	j193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַחְמִֽ⁠י	1	Job is referring to eating by association with the **food** that people eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when I eat”
6:8	j194		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יִ֭תֵּן תָּב֣וֹא שֶֽׁאֱלָתִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Who will grant my request” or “I wish that someone would make happen what I am requesting”
6:9	yf92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וְ⁠יֹאֵ֣ל אֱ֭לוֹהַּ וִֽ⁠ידַכְּאֵ֑⁠נִי	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and**. The verb **be willing** tells in what way Job hopes God will **crush** him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “and may God willingly crush me” or “and may God agree to crush me”
6:9	f53h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַתֵּ֥ר יָ֝ד֗⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may he use his power”
6:9	j196		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וִֽ⁠יבַצְּעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if he were a branch that God might **cut … off** from a tree in order to kill it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and kill me”
6:10	gre4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ֥⁠תְהִי ע֨וֹד ׀ נֶ֘חָ֤מָתִ֗⁠י וַ⁠אֲסַלְּדָ֣ה בְ֭⁠חִילָה לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל כִּי־לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the last phrase in this sentence first, since it gives the reason for what the first and second phrases describe. Alternate translation: “I have not concealed the sayings of the Holy One, so may that still be my consolation; may it enable me to be cheerful in pain even if God does not spare me”
6:10	j197		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֥⁠תְהִי ע֨וֹד ׀ נֶ֘חָ֤מָתִ֗⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **consolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “And may this still console me”
6:10	j198		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “may God not spare”
6:10	j199		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל	1	Job is not wishing that God would not spare him. He is referring implicitly to the possibility that God might not spare him. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “even if God does not spare me”
6:10	j200		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is speaking as if he could literally have **concealed** the **sayings of the Holy One**. He means that he has not treated God’s decrees regarding people as if they did not exist. In other words, he has obeyed them and, to this point in the book, he has not questioned them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have not disobeyed or questioned the sayings of the Holy One” or “I have not disobeyed or questioned God’s decrees”
6:10	ji9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **concealed**. Alternate translation: “I have obeyed God’s decrees” or “I have trusted God’s decrees”
6:10	j201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is using the adjective **Holy** as a noun to refer to God by describing what God is like. The ULT adds the word **One** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this expression with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “God, who is holy”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “I do not have enough strength to wait! And I should not try to prolong my life beyond when it will end!”
6:11	j202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִֽי־אֲיַחֵ֑ל	1	Job means implicitly that he does not have the strength to wait or endure until he receives the long-term blessings that Eliphaz said he would have if he committed his cause to God.

6:13	j205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ֝⁠תֻשִׁיָּ֗ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **initiative**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and the capacity to act on my own behalf”

6:14	s4yi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לַ⁠מָּ֣ס	1	Job is using the adjective **despairing** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

6:14	e6e6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מֵרֵעֵ֣⁠הוּ חָ֑סֶד	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:14	naj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יִרְאַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י יַעֲזֽוֹב	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that a friend should show faithfulness to a despairing person even if that person forsakes the fear of the Almighty (as Job’s friends believe he may be doing). Alternate translation: “even if that despairing person forsakes the fear of the Almighty” (2) that if a friend does not show faithfulness to a despairing person, that friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty. Alternate translation: “otherwise that friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty”
6:14	j206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִרְאַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י יַעֲזֽוֹב	1	Job is using the word **fear** to mean respect for God that leads a person to obey God.

6:15	p13y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	בָּגְד֣וּ כְמוֹ־נָ֑חַל	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **seasonal stream** would appear to be a good source of water but then fail in the dry season, so Job’s friends seemingly came to offer encouragement, but they have provided none. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “have dealt treacherously by seeming to offer encouragement but then not offering any, like a seasonal stream that seems to offer water but then fails in the dry season”
6:15	j209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	 כַּ⁠אֲפִ֖יק נְחָלִ֣ים יַעֲבֹֽרוּ	1	In this context, the expression **pass away** means to dry up.

6:15	l6xj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 כַּ⁠אֲפִ֖יק נְחָלִ֣ים יַעֲבֹֽרוּ	1	Job is speaking as if his friends literally **pass away** or dry up the way a desert stream does. He means that in the end, they fail to provide the encouragement that they implicitly promised by coming to see him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They have no help to offer in the end, like a channel for seasonal streams that runs dry” or “You have no help to offer in the end, like a channel for seasonal streams that runs dry”
6:16	j211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In this verse, Job describes the state of desert streams in the cold season, and in the next verse, he contrasts that with the state of the streams in the hot season. To show this contrast, you could create a verse bridge for verses 16–17. It might say something like this: “In the cold season, these streams are dark from ice over their channel, indeed, snow covers that channel. But in the hot season, the streams go dry and vanish, the heat dries them up completely”
6:16	pnp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠קֹּדְרִ֥ים מִנִּי־קָ֑רַח עָ֝לֵ֗י⁠מוֹ יִתְעַלֶּם־שָֽׁלֶג	1	The pronoun **it** refers in both cases to the “channel” of streams that Job described in the previous verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These streams are dark from ice over their channel; that channel hides itself with snow”
6:16	cq2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִתְעַלֶּם־שָֽׁלֶג	1	Job is speaking as if a channel of desert streams were a living thing that **hides itself with snow** in the winter.

6:18	vke1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִ֭לָּ֣פְתוּ אָרְח֣וֹת דַּרְכָּ֑⁠ם	1	The implication is that these **Caravans** are leaving their usual routes to look for water in the dry season. The oases along the routes have presumably dried up, and the caravans are going to places where they expect to find streams still flowing. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Caravans turn themselves aside from their way to look for water”
6:18	j212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַעֲל֖וּ	1	The expression **go up** does not necessarily indicate travel to a higher elevation. In this context, it probably means to leave the caravan route and go into the untracked desert. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “they go out”
6:19	j213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הִ֭בִּיטוּ אָרְח֣וֹת תֵּמָ֑א	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:20	mue3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בֹּ֥שׁוּ & וַ⁠יֶּחְפָּֽרוּ	1	The expressions translated **They were ashamed** and **they were confounded** may seem like passive verbal expressions, and if your language does not use such expressions, you could express these ideas in active form or in another way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “They felt shame … but the dry stream bed confounded them”
6:20	j214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עָ֝דֶ֗י⁠הָ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the stream bed where the caravans expected to find water. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “as far as the stream bed where they expected to find water”
6:21	gk7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to explain in what way his friends are like the desert streams he has been describing, as he said they were in verse 15.

Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
6:21	wa4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֱיִ֣יתֶם לא	1	Job is speaking of his friends as if they had become **nothing**, just as a stream ceases to exist when all of its water dries up. He means that his friends are offering him no help, just as a dried-up stream would not help a caravan that needed water in the desert. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are not offering me any help”
6:21	zr7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תִּֽרְא֥וּ חֲ֝תַ֗ת וַ⁠תִּירָֽאוּ	1	Job seems to be saying implicitly that his friends think that God has afflicted him with a **terror** and so they are afraid to console him, because they think God will afflict them as well if they take his side. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you think that God has sent this terror and so you are afraid to help me because you think God will punish you if you do”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations.

6:24	j218		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י אַחֲרִ֑ישׁ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **will be silent**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly be silent”
6:24	j219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מַה־ שָּׁ֝גִ֗יתִי	1	Job is speaking as if he could have literally **strayed** off the right path. He means that he could have done something wrong. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and what I have done wrong”
6:25	j220		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִמְרֵי־יֹ֑שֶׁר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **uprightness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “upright words”
6:25	bt6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַה־ יּוֹכִ֖יחַ הוֹכֵ֣חַ מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But correcting from you does not correct anything!”
6:25	rrn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וּ⁠מַה־ יּוֹכִ֖יחַ הוֹכֵ֣חַ מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	For emphasis, Job is using a construction in which a subject and its verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “But what does your attempted correction really accomplish?” or “Your attempted correction really accomplishes nothing!”
6:26	j221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הַ⁠לְ⁠הוֹכַ֣ח מִלִּ֣ים תַּחְשֹׁ֑בוּ וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you think to correct my words, and do you liken to the wind the words of one despairing”
6:26	l7bp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠לְ⁠הוֹכַ֣ח מִלִּ֣ים תַּחְשֹׁ֑בוּ וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You think to correct my words, and you liken the words of one despairing to the wind!” or “You only want to prove me wrong; you do not believe that I am justified in saying these desperate things!”
6:26	j222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	If Job is saying that his friends are likening his words to the wind, then Job is making a comparison. The point of the comparison is that Job’s friends consider his **words** to be trivial, having no more substance than **wind**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and do you consider the words of one despairing to be as insubstantial as the wind”
6:27	w62r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־ יָת֥וֹם תַּפִּ֑ילוּ וְ֝⁠תִכְר֗וּ עַל־ רֵֽיעֲ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job assumes that his friends will understand that he is referring to two practices of his culture. If a man died who was indebted to others, his creditors could claim his children as slaves in repayment of the debt. Job is describing how such creditors might **cast lots** in order to determine which of them would get a particular child as a slave. Job is also referring to the practice of selling someone into slavery in order to obtain repayment of a debt. You can explain some of this cultural background in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you cast lots to see which of you will have as a slave a child whose father, indebted to you, has died, and you try to get the best price for a friend whom you are selling into slavery to obtain repayment of his debt to you”
6:27	q6lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־ יָת֥וֹם תַּפִּ֑ילוּ וְ֝⁠תִכְר֗וּ עַל־ רֵֽיעֲ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends would literally **cast lots** to see which of them would have an **fatherless** child as his slave and **haggle** over the price of a **friend** they were selling into slavery. Job does not mean that his friends are actually doing these things; he is making a comparison. The implication is that these are particularly callous things to do to a helpless orphan or to a friend, and Job is saying that his friends are acting just as callously towards him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The UST models one way of doing this.
6:27	h7jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	יָת֥וֹם	1	Job is using the adjective **fatherless** as a noun, to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “a fatherless child” or “an orphan”
6:28	m2bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ֭⁠עַתָּה הוֹאִ֣ילוּ פְנוּ־בִ֑⁠י וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	Job is asking his friends to perform a symbolic action by looking directly at him so that he can look them right in the face himself. Job wants to be able to do this in order to dramatize the sincerity of what he is saying. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “But now, be willing, look at me, so that I can look right at you to show that I am speaking the truth”
6:28	j223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	This could mean: (1) that Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Specifically, he is speaking the first part of an oath and leaving the second part understood. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and if I would lie to your faces, then may God punish me severely!” (2) that Job is using the word **if** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “for I would not lie to your faces, would I?”
6:28	q6v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	Job is using one part of his friends, their **faces**, to mean all of them in the act of looking at him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and if I would lie to you while you were looking at me”
6:29	c7zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֻֽׁבוּ & וְשׁ֥וּבוּ	1	Job is speaking as if he wants his friends literally to **turn** and go in a different direction. He means that he wants them to start treating him differently. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “start treating me differently … yes, treat me differently”
6:29	j224		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַל־תְּהִ֣י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **injustice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “do not treat me unjustly”
6:29	fcq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אַל־תְּהִ֣י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative noun **injustice**. Alternate translation: “let there be justice” or “treat me justly”
6:29	j225		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ע֝וֹד צִדְקִ⁠י־בָֽ⁠הּ	1	The pronoun **it** seems to refer to Job’s cause. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my righteousness is yet in my cause” or “my cause is still righteous”
6:30	km3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יֵשׁ־ בִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֥⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה אִם־ חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־ יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis in both of these sentences. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “There is no injustice on my tongue! My mouth discerns iniquity!”
6:30	z316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠יֵשׁ־בִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֥⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	Job is referring to what he says by association with the **tongue**, by which he says it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Is there injustice in what I have been saying”
6:30	j226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “My mouth discerns iniquity, does it not”
6:30	f1ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אִם־חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is speaking of his **mouth** as if it were a living thing that could **discern iniquity**. He means that he himself is able to discern whether something he might say with his mouth would be morally wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I discern whether I might be speaking iniquity, do I not?” or “Certainly I can discern whether I might be speaking iniquity!”
6:30	j227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַוּֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **iniquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what is iniquitous” or “what is morally wrong”
7:intro	y5ka				0	# Job 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job finishes responding to Eliphaz’s first speech, and he also addresses God directly in light of his exchange with Eliphaz.\n- Verses 1–6: Job continues to respond to Elilphaz\n- Verses 7–21: Job addresses God directly\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJob uses many different images in this chapter to describe what the things are like that he is feeling and experiencing. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJob often uses the question form in this chapter to emphasize the points he is making to Eliphaz and to God. Notes suggest how these questions may be translated as statements or exclamations if that would be more natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:1	nz5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־ צָבָ֣א לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ על־ אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֖י שָׂכִ֣יר יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Man has hardship on earth! Yes, his days are like the days of a hireling!”
7:1	j228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הֲ⁠לֹא־צָבָ֣א לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ על־אָ֑רֶץ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Life on earth is hard for a man!”
7:1	j229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “to a person”
7:1	m3yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֖י שָׂכִ֣יר יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	Job is using this comparison to say that just as **the days of a hireling** (that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor) are long and difficult, so his days are long and difficult. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “Yes, his days are long and difficult, like those of a hireling!”
7:2	g9ji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠עֶ֥בֶד יִשְׁאַף־ צֵ֑ל וּ֝⁠כְ⁠שָׂכִ֗יר יְקַוֶּ֥ה פָעֳלֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of this comparison, as Job makes clear in the next verse, is that just as a **slave** and a **hireling** have to endure long periods of wishing for relief, so Job has gone a long time without relief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “As a slave wishes all through a long, hot day that evening would come, and as a hireling must wait until the end of the day to be paid”
7:2	f1pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	צֵ֑ל	1	Job is using the term **shade** to mean by association the evening, when the sun becomes low in the sky and shadows cover the earth. Specifically, he means the end of the work day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the evening” or “the end of the work day”
7:3	fpt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who has done the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has caused me to inherit months of futility”
7:3	j230		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	Job is speaking of these **months of futility** as if they were something that he had literally been **caused to inherit**. He means that he has been enduring futility during this time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time of futility”
7:3	cp2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **futility**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time when life seems futile”
7:3	j231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	From the narrative of the book of Job, it does not appear that at this point **months** have gone by since Job began to experience his terrible misfortunes. So it seems that Job is using the term **months** to mean by association a period of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time of futility”
7:3	j232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠לֵיל֥וֹת עָ֝מָ֗ל מִנּוּ־לִֽ⁠י	1	The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Job is using this indefinite construction to focus on what has been **appointed** to him rather than on who appointed it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “and nights of trouble have been appointed to me”
7:4	m7jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־שָׁכַ֗בְתִּי	1	Job is referring implicitly to when he would **lie down** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Your language may have its own expression that you could use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “When I lie down to sleep”
7:4	sf4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מָתַ֣י אָ֭קוּם	1	Job is not asking himself this question for information, to try to decide when to get up in the morning. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I hope this will not be a long and difficult night!”
7:4	m4sv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שָׂבַ֖עְתִּי נְדֻדִ֣ים	1	Job is speaking of himself as if he were a container that **tossings** filled. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I toss and turn continually”
7:5	j233		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לָ֘בַ֤שׁ בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י רִ֭מָּה וְג֣וּשׁ עָפָ֑ר	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally wearing worms and dust clods like clothing on his body. He means that he has these things all over his body. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My flesh is covered with worms and dust clods”
7:5	sh53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לָ֘בַ֤שׁ בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י רִ֭מָּה וְג֣וּשׁ עָפָ֑ר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **worm** or **clod of dust**. He means worms and dust clods in general. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. “My flesh is covered with worms and dust clods”
7:5	l429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean his whole body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My body”
7:5	we79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עוֹרִ֥⁠י רָ֝גַ֗ע וַ⁠יִּמָּאֵֽס	1	Job is referring to the boils with which God allowed the accuser to afflict him, as the book describes in [2:7](../02/07.md). You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “my skin breaks and festers because of the boils that I have”
7:6	tf2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יָמַ֣⁠י קַ֭לּוּ מִנִּי־אָ֑רֶג	1	Job his comparing his **days** to a **shuttle**, which stores and releases a supply of yearn for weavers, to say how quickly his days are going by. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. The UST models one way to do this.
7:6	j234		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָמַ֣⁠י קַ֭לּוּ	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, the time that he will live on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My life is ending more quickly”
7:6	j235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אָ֑רֶג	1	A **shuttle** is a wooden tool that weavers use when weaving to store and unravel yarn while passing it back and forth through other threads of yarn mounted on a loom. If your readers would not be familiar with what a shuttle is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a tool for weaving” or “a tool for making cloth quickly”
7:6	j236		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ֝⁠יִּכְל֗וּ בְּ⁠אֶ֣פֶס תִּקְוָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I cannot hope that my life will be good in the end”
7:7	j237		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	זְ֭כֹר	1	To this point in the speech he began in [6:1](../06/01.md), Job has been addressing his three friends, and so the pronoun **you** has been plural and the imperative forms have been second-person plural. However, the imperative **Remember** here is singular because Job is now addressing God, as he will do for the rest of this speech. So use a second-person singular imperative in your translation if your language marks that distinction. You may also wish to indicate explicitly that Job is now addressing God. Alternate translation: “God, remember”
7:7	uf8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	זְ֭כֹר	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “God, please remember”
7:7	ee27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ר֣וּחַ חַיָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his **life** were literally a **breath**. He likely means that just as a breath of air that a person exhales quickly dissipates, so his life will soon end. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life will be over soon”
7:7	bw35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing.

7:7	j238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	In this context, the expression **return** means to do something again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not see good again”
7:7	j239		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	In this context, to **see** good means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not experience good again”
7:7	j240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **good**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I will not experience good things again”
7:8	j241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־תְ֭שׁוּרֵ⁠נִי עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	As the second part of the verse indicates, Job is speaking implicitly of what will happen after he dies. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The eye of the one seeing me now will not regard me then”
7:8	p6u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	Job is using one part of God, his **eye**, to mean all of God in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The one seeing me”
7:8	f5vc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	Even though Job has begun to address God, here is speaking about God in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “You who see me”
7:8	j339		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עֵינֶ֖י⁠ךָ בִּ֣⁠י	1	This expression means that God will be looking for Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will be looking for me”
7:9	q76u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּלָ֣ה עָ֭נָן וַ⁠יֵּלַ֑ךְ	1	Job could be: (1) saying that once a cloud **disappears**, it **goes away** forever. That same cloud will never again form in the sky. Alternate translation: “Once a cloud disappears, it goes away forever” (2) using the similar expressions **disappears** and **goes away** together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “A cloud disappears entirely”
7:9	g4h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֣א יַעֲלֶֽה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **ascend**, which is contrary to the reality of life, according to Job here. Alternate translation: “remains there”
7:10	xnf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹא־יַכִּירֶ֖⁠נּוּ ע֣וֹד מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a person’s **place** of residence as if it were a living thing that could **know** that person. The word **know** in this context means to recognize. The idea is that the place where the person once lived will not have occasion to recognize him again because he will never return to that place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no, he will not live in his place of residence again”
7:11	ed6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י אֲֽ֭דַבְּרָה	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **restrain**. Job is also using an emphatic declarative form when he says **I will speak**. If your language has similar constructions that it uses for emphasis, you may want to use them here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly not restrain my mouth; I will certainly speak”
7:11	q76q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he would say with his mouth.

7:11	j242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **restrain**. Alternate translation: “I will speak freely”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will speak in my distress; yes, I will complain in my bitterness”

The scribes made this change in order to avoid the uncomfortable suggestion that a human being’s sin could have effects on God. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the readingof the ULT. Alternate translation: “Indeed, am I a burden to you?” or “I am not a burden to you!”

Alternate translation: “Soon I will lie down in the dust, and you will seek me diligently, but I will not exist. So why will you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity?”

8:intro	md4v				0	# Job 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Bildad responds to what Job said in chapters 6 and 7.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Bildad answering Job with his own words\n\nIn [7:21](../07/21.md), at the end of his speech, Job suggested that God might **seek** for him **diligently**. Bildad says in his response in [8:5](../08/05.md) that it is actually Job who should be seeking God diligently. To help your readers appreciate how Bildad is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Bildad’s expression **seek diligently** the same way that you translated it when Job used it in [7:21](../07/21.md).\n\n### Quotation within a quotation\n\nIn his speech, Bildad encourages Job to consider the wisdom of their ancestors. In verses 11–22, he may be quoting from traditional teachings. Notes suggest the possibility of punctuating these verses as a secondary quotation if your language might naturally put one direct quotation inside another.

Alternate translation: “and … be so insistent but so insubstantial”

He actually means that God killed Job’s children in order to punish them for their sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then God punished them by killing them for the sins they committed”
8:5	lpy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־אַ֭תָּה תְּשַׁחֵ֣ר אֶל־אֵ֑ל	1	For emphasis, Bildad is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **seek diligently**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “If you seek diligently for God yourself”
8:5	q7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֶל־שַׁ֝דַּ֗י תִּתְחַנָּֽן	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

8:6	a4ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	זַ֥ךְ וְ⁠יָשָׁ֗ר	1	The terms **pure** and **upright** mean similar things. Bildad is using the two terms together for emphasis.

8:6	j264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נְוַ֣ת צִדְקֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using one aspect of Job, his **righteousness**, to mean all of him as a righteous person.

Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of what he is saying. He means that Job’s former state, great though it was, will seem small by comparison with the much greater prosperity that Job will experience in the future if he seeks God diligently. Alternate translation: “Though your former state was great, your future will be so much greater that the former state will seem as if it had been small”

Alternate translation: “we have not been alive for very long and we do not know very much”
8:9	j268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אֲ֭נַחְנוּ וְ⁠לֹ֣א נֵדָ֑ע & יָמֵ֣י⁠נוּ	1	By **we** and **our**, Bildad means himself and the other friends and also Job, to whom he is speaking, so use the inclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

Our ancestors will speak to you, and from their hearts they will bring forth words”
8:10	j271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠לֹא־הֵ֣ם י֭וֹרוּ⁠ךָ יֹ֣אמְרוּ לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ֝⁠מִ⁠לִּבָּ֗⁠ם יוֹצִ֥אוּ מִלִּֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if Job’s ancestors would **teach** him and **speak to** him. He does not mean this literally. Instead, he means that Job can learn from the accumulated wisdom that has been passed down to them from their ancestors through tradition. Bildad will summarize this traditional teaching in the rest of his speech. Particularly if there is a practice of ancestor worship in your culture, be sure to make this meaning clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “You can learn much from the traditional teachings we have received from them. It would be as if they were speaking to you and bringing forth words from their hearts”
8:10	h2ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־הֵ֣ם י֭וֹרוּ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis.

8:10	u4ad		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠לִּבָּ֗⁠ם יוֹצִ֥אוּ מִלִּֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if the ancestors would literally **bring forth words** from **their hearts**, as if their hearts were containers that held words and as if words were physical objects that someone could **bring forth**. He is using the word **hearts** to mean a person’s thoughts and emotions. He is saying that through tradition the ancestors have passed down their most cherished beliefs and the most profound lessons they learned in life. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they will share with you their most cherished insights”
8:11	a2hm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	הֲ⁠יִֽגְאֶה־גֹּ֭מֶא בְּ⁠לֹ֣א בִצָּ֑ה יִשְׂגֶּה־אָ֥חוּ בְלִי־מָֽיִם	1	From here to the end of the chapter, Bildad may be quoting the teaching of the ancestors. This would be a second-level quotation, since the book is already quoting Bildad’s speech. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the start of this possible quotation from tradition with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation.
8:11	tj37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יִֽגְאֶה־גֹּ֭מֶא בְּ⁠לֹ֣א בִצָּ֑ה יִשְׂגֶּה־אָ֥חוּ בְלִי־מָֽיִם	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Papyrus does not grow without a marsh. A reed does not grow without waters.”
8:11	ig9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	גֹּ֭מֶא	1	The word **papyrus** describes a tall, reed-like plant that grows in shallow water. If your readers would not be familiar with what papyrus is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable plant in your area, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a bulrush” or “a cattail”
8:12	j272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְ֭⁠אִבּ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **greenness**, you could express the same idea in another way. The idea is that while marsh plants dry up and lose color at the end of their life cycles, this is a young plant that is still colorful and growing. Alternate translation: “young and growing”
8:12	q4x1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י כָל־חָצִ֣יר יִיבָֽשׁ	1	Bildad assumes that Job will understand that he means that even a young, uncut reed **withers** without water. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but without water it withers before any other plant”
8:12	j273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י כָל־חָצִ֣יר יִיבָֽשׁ	1	Bildad says **any** as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “but without water it withers very quickly”
8:13	y6pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כֵּ֗ן אָ֭רְחוֹת כָּל־שֹׁ֣כְחֵי אֵ֑ל	1	Bildad is speaking of the things that happen to people as if they were literally **paths** that those people were walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is what happens to all the ones forgetting God”
8:13	fc76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠תִקְוַ֖ת חָנֵ֣ף תֹּאבֵֽד	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and the godless will not get what they hope for”
8:13	j274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֣ף	1	Bildad is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a godless person”
8:14	yg2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁר־יָק֥וֹט כִּסְל֑⁠וֹ וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **confidence** of a person who is godless literally **snaps** and as if the **trust** of a godless person were literally a spider’s web (**the house of a spider**). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “whose confidence proves unfounded and whose trust is unreliable”
8:14	m1bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֲשֶׁר־יָק֥וֹט כִּסְל֑⁠וֹ וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **confidence** and **trust**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He is confident that certain things will happen, but they do not happen; he trusts in certain people and things to help him, but they do not”
8:14	e61x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using **the house of a spider** (that is, a spider’s web) to represent something flimsy and unreliable. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly as a comparison. Alternate translation: “and whose trust is as flimsy and unreliable as a spider’s web”
8:15	g7al		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִשָּׁעֵ֣ן עַל־בֵּ֭ית⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֹ֑ד יַחֲזִ֥יק בּ֝֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	Bildad is speaking of a godless person as if he were literally leaning against his **house** and causing it to collapse beyond repair. The house represents the possessions and status of the godless person. Alternate translation: “It does not take much for a godless person to lose his possessions and status without any hope of recovering them”
8:15	r6mq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֹ֑ד & וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use positive statements in your translation in place of these negative ones. Alternate translation: “and it collapses … but it remains collapsed”
8:15	s164		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	Bildad is speaking of the **house** of a godless person as if it were a living thing that could **arise** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he cannot make it stand upright again” or “but he cannot repair it”
8:16	x5ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רָטֹ֣ב ה֭וּא לִ⁠פְנֵי־שָׁ֑מֶשׁ וְ⁠עַ֥ל גַּ֝נָּת֗⁠וֹ יֹֽנַקְתּ֥⁠וֹ תֵצֵֽא	1	Bildad now speaks of a godless person as if he were a plant. In order to depict the temporary prosperity that godless people may enjoy, he describes this plant flourishing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning as a comparison. Alternate translation: “A godless person may at first thrive like a plant that is getting plenty of sunlight and whose shoots extend all over the garden in which it is planted”
8:16	d31w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠פְנֵי־שָׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	Here the word **to the face of** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” something. Bildad means that the plant is **lush** because it receives plenty of sunlight. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because it receives plenty of sunlight”
8:17	cty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־גַּ֭ל שָֽׁרָשָׁ֣י⁠ו יְסֻבָּ֑כוּ בֵּ֖ית אֲבָנִ֣ים יֶחֱזֶֽה	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of the godless person and his temporary prosperity as if he were a plant. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “A godless person may at first be secure, like a plant whose roots are wrapped around a heap of stones, a plant that is solidly rooted among stones”
8:17	j275		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עַל־גַּ֭ל שָֽׁרָשָׁ֣י⁠ו יְסֻבָּ֑כוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “It wraps its roots around a heap of stones”
8:17	j276		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בֵּ֖ית אֲבָנִ֣ים יֶחֱזֶֽה	1	Bildad is speaking as if this plant were looking for a **house** to live in. He means that the plant naturally roots itself in a secure place among **rocks**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it roots itself in a secure place among rocks”
8:18	j277		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	אִם	1	In this verse, Bildad is drawing a contrast between the prosperity he described in the previous two verses and the inevitable destruction of the godless person. In your translation, you may wish to introduce this verse in a way that will indicate this contrast more explicitly. Alternate translation: “But when”
8:18	ib86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְבַלְּעֶ֥⁠נּוּ מִ⁠מְּקוֹמ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ	1	The pronoun **it** refers in its first and third instances to the plant Bildad has been describing, and it refers in its second instance to the **place** the plant was occupying. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “When one destroys such a plant from its place, then the place it formerly occupied will deny it”
8:18	tq8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ בּ֝֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רְאִיתִֽי⁠ךָ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “It will deny that it ever saw it”
8:18	b7jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ בּ֝֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רְאִיתִֽי⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is speaking of the plant’s location as if it were a living thing that could recognize things and speak. The meaning of this phrase is similar to the meaning of the phrase “his place will not know him again” in [7:10](../07/10.md). In this case, Bildad is saying that the plant will be so thoroughly removed that its former location will be convinced that it was never there to begin with. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it will be as if it had never been there at all”
8:19	llr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	מְשׂ֣וֹשׂ דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. He is speaking in this way for emphasis. He does not mean that the godless person has actual **joy**. Such a person may have temporary prosperity, but he then experiences sorrow as a consequence of the way he has been living. Alternate translation: “the sorrow of his way”
8:19	z27b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מְשׂ֣וֹשׂ דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the sorrow that comes from his conduct”
8:19	n1qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עָפָ֗ר אַחֵ֥ר יִצְמָֽחוּ	1	Bildad is continuing to speak as if the godless person were a plant. When he says that **other plants** will **sprout** from the **dust** (that is, the ground), he means that other people will take the place of the godless person when his conduct causes his ruin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and other people will take his position and his possessions”
8:20	i9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֵ֭ל לֹ֣א יִמְאַס־תָּ֑ם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **reject**. Alternate translation: “God will always accept the innocent”
8:20	j278		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תָּ֑ם	1	Bildad is using the adjective **innocent** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a person who is innocent”
8:20	gz4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יַ֝חֲזִ֗יק בְּ⁠יַד־מְרֵעִֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if God would literally **hold** evildoers by the **hand** in order to keep them from falling down. He means that God does not strengthen or support people who do evil. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he will not help evildoers”
8:21	e5gp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and he will fill your lips with shouting”
8:21	ezc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is speaking of Job’s **mouth** as if it were a container that God would **fill** with **laughter** and as if Job’s **lips** were a container that God would fill with **shouting**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will yet make you shout very joyfully”
8:21	td9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is using parts of Job, his **mouth** and his **lips**, to mean all of Job in the acts of laughing and shouting joyfully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will yet make you laugh very happily and shout very joyfully”
8:22	tc4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִלְבְּשׁוּ־בֹ֑שֶׁת	1	Bildad is speaking as if Job’s enemies would literally **wear shame** as if it were their clothing. He means that they will be greatly ashamed for opposing Job when God honors and restores him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will be greatly ashamed”
8:22	k5y9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אֹ֖הֶל רְשָׁעִ֣ים אֵינֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	Bildad is using one possession of **the wicked**, the **tent** in which they live, to mean all of their possessions and their standing in the community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the wicked will be without status or means”
8:22	uz63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
8:22	j279		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֵינֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	If you decided to punctuate verses 11–22 as a second-level quotation, indicate the end of this quotation here with a closing second-level quotation mark or whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation.
9:intro	n51u				0	# Job 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is Job’s response to Bildad’s first speech. In [8:5](../08/05.md), Bildad told Job that he should appeal to God. In response, Job protests in this chapter that a human being cannot appeal to God.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 5–10, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n\nGod is wise in heart and mighty in strength (Who has hardened himself against him and been whole?),\n> the one removing mountains and they do not know, who overturns them in his anger,\n> the one shaking the earth from its place and causing its pillars to tremble,\n> the one speaking to the sun and it does not rise, and upon the stars he seals,\n> stretching out the heavens by himself and treading on the waves of the sea,\n> making the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south,\n> doing great {things} until there is no searching and distinguished {things} until there is no number.
9:2	r4pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַה־יִּצְדַּ֖ק אֱנ֣וֹשׁ עִם־אֵֽל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But a man cannot be righteous with God!”
9:2	a9ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
9:3	t9fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־יַ֭חְפֹּץ לָ⁠רִ֣יב עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	In this part of the verse, the pronoun **he** refers to “a man” and the pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “If a person desires to contend with God”
9:3	a6um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠רִ֣יב עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job assumes that Bildad will understand that he is using the word **contend** to mean making a formal legal complaint against God. In this culture, people made such complaints to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party would question the other in the presence of the leaders, who would then discuss the case and decide how to resolve it. Job is probably describing how he participated as a leader in such cases in [29:21–23](../29/21.md). Your language may have an expression for this process that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to take God to court” or “to file charges against God”
9:3	j280		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹֽא־יַ֝עֲנֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	In this part of the verse, (1) the pronoun **he** could refer to a human being and the pronoun **him** could refer to God. This seems likely, since after describing God’s knowledge and power, Job asks in [9:14](../09/14.md) how he could possibly answer God and in [9:32](../09/32.md) he says that God is “not a man, as I am, that I could answer him.” Alternate translation: “a human will not answer God” (2) the pronoun **he** could refer to God and the pronoun **him** could refer to a human being. This is also a possibility, since Job protests in [30:20](../30/20.md) that God does not answer him. Alternate translation: “God will not answer a human”
9:3	j281		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	לֹֽא־יַ֝עֲנֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	If Job means that a human will not answer God, then he is using the future tense to describe what a person would be able to do. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “he could not answer him” or “he would not be able to answer him”
9:3	el71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	 אַחַ֥ת מִנִּי־אָֽלֶף	1	The expression **not … one from a thousand** (that is, not one time out of a thousand) is an overstatement for emphasis. It is unlikely that one party in a court case would ask the other party as many as a thousand questions. Job means that a person would not find a single way to answer God satisfactorily no matter how many questions God asked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no matter how many questions he asks”
9:4	j282		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֲכַ֣ם לֵ֭בָב	1	The pronoun **He** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God is wise in heart”
9:4	mh8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֲכַ֣ם לֵ֭בָב וְ⁠אַמִּ֣יץ כֹּ֑חַ	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “God’s thoughts are wise and he is mighty in strength”
9:4	f7rj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠אַמִּ֣יץ כֹּ֑חַ	1	The terms **mighty** and **strength** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and very strong”
9:4	j283		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־הִקְשָׁ֥ה אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָֽם	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No person has ever hardened himself against God and been whole!”
9:4	b286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִקְשָׁ֥ה אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו	1	Job is likely referring to bringing charges against God when he speaks of a person who has **hardened himself against** God, since a person who brings charges has determined not to show mercy. Rather, that person has decided to demand justice. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has brought charges against him”
9:4	j284		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָֽם	1	By **whole**, Job probably means not suffering any damages, that is, winning a court case and having the other party pay compensation, rather than having to pay compensation oneself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and won the case”
9:5	j285		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠מַּעְתִּ֣יק הָ֭רִים	1	When Job refers to God removing **mountains**, he is likely describing earthquakes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly in your translation, as the UST does.
9:5	at5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠מַּעְתִּ֣יק הָ֭רִים	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God is the one who removes mountains”
9:5	j286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָדָ֑עוּ	1	This could mean: (1) that the **mountains** do not know that God is about to remove them. In that case Job would be speaking of the mountains as if they were living things that could **know** something that was about to happen. (2) that people in general do not know that God is about to remove the mountains. In that case **they** would be an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Either way, the idea is that God removes mountains without anyone or anything knowing in advance. Alternate translation: “suddenly” or “unexpectedly”
9:5	j344		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠אַפּֽ⁠וֹ	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, Job is using the term **nose** to mean anger by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “in his anger”
9:6	xth3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠עַמּוּדֶ֗י⁠הָ יִתְפַלָּצֽוּ⁠ן	1	People in this culture believed that there were **pillars** holding up the earth. You could retain the reference to pillars in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and causing it to tremble from deep underground”
9:7	j287		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠אֹמֵ֣ר לַ֭⁠חֶרֶס וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִזְרָ֑ח	1	Job is speaking as if the **sun** literally did not **rise** on certain days. He most likely means that the sun is not visible on those days because of cloud cover. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who determines whether the sun will shine or clouds will cover it”
9:7	mt2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְעַ֖ד כּוֹכָבִ֣ים יַחְתֹּֽם	1	Job is speaking as if God literally put a seal over **the stars** on certain nights. He most likely means that the stars are not visible on those nights because of cloud cover. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and who keeps the stars from shining on certain nights”
9:8	lya7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נֹטֶ֣ה שָׁמַ֣יִם לְ⁠בַדּ֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠דוֹרֵ֗ךְ עַל־בָּ֥מֳתֵי יָֽם	1	People in this culture believed that the **heavens** (that is, the sky) were a solid object that God had stretched out over a framework in order to cover the earth. For example, [Isaiah 40:22](../isa/40/22.md) says, “He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out like a tent to live in.” You could retain the reference to God **stretching out the heavens** in your translation, and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God alone created the sky and treads on the waves of the sea”
9:8	xis1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 וְ֝⁠דוֹרֵ֗ךְ עַל־בָּ֥מֳתֵי יָֽם	1	As a note to [7:12](../07/12.md) explains, people in this culture considered the **sea** to be the realm of chaos. When Job speaks of God **treading on the waves of the sea**, he is speaking as if God were literally trampling down the forces of chaos with his feet. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and subduing the watery forces of chaos”
9:9	n4y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עָ֭שׁ כְּסִ֥יל וְ⁠כִימָ֗ה	1	The words **Bear**, **Orion**, and **Pleiades** are the names of constellations of stars in the sky. Your culture may have its own terms for these constellations. Alternate translation: “the Big Dipper, the Hunter, and the Seven Sisters”
9:9	j288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠חַדְרֵ֥י תֵמָֽן	1	People in this culture believed that God kept natural forces in **chambers**. For example, [Psalm 19:4–5](../psa/19/04.md) says that God has “pitched a tent for the sun” in the sky, from which the sun comes forth “like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber.” [Psalm 135:7](../psa/135/07.md) refers similarly to God bringing the wind out of his “storehouses.” In [Job 37:9](../37/09.md), Elihu says that “the storm comes from its chamber.” So the reference here to **the chambers of the south** is likely to a place where, it was believed, God kept all the constellations of stars and from which God brought them out each night. You could retain the reference to these **chambers** in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Job is likely referring to the constellations themselves by association with their **chambers**. Alternate translation: “and all the other constellations”
9:10	g1vu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	גְ֭דֹלוֹת & וְ⁠נִפְלָא֗וֹת	1	Job is using the adjective **great** and the participle **distinguished** as nouns to mean certain kinds of things. The ULT adds the word **things** to show this. Your language may use adjectives and participles in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent terms. Alternate translation: “wonders … and marvels”
9:12	gm8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֵ֣ן יַ֭חְתֹּף מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ מִֽי־ יֹאמַ֥ר אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו מַֽה־ תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “If he takes something away, no one can bring it back. No one can ask him, ‘What are you doing?’”
9:12	j289		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The meaning of **who will turn him back** depends on the meaning of the phrase **he takes away**. That phrase could mean: (1) that God takes something away. Alternate translation: “who can make him give it back” (2) that God leaves. Alternate translation: “who can make him come back”
9:12	j290		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מִֽי־יֹאמַ֥ר אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו מַֽה־תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Who can ask him what he is doing”
9:12	tc75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַֽה־תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	The person challenging God would be using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be doing that!”
9:13	j345		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the word **nose** in verse 5. Alternate translation: “God will not turn aside his anger”
9:13	j291		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if God might literally make his anger **turn aside** and go in a different direction. Job is actually describing how God might stop being angry (although in this case he would not). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God will not stop being angry”
9:13	j292		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “God will still have anger”
9:13	nzr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	רָֽהַב	1	The word **Rahab** is another name for the sea monster. See the General Introduction to Job for a discussion of the **sea monster**, and see how you translated the name Leviathan in [3:8](../03/08.md). Alternate translation: “the sea monster that is associated with chaos”
9:13	j340		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹ֣זְרֵי רָֽהַב	1	When Job speaks of **the helpers of Rahab**, he likely means ocean waves, since he says in [9:8](../09/08.md), in a context of overcoming chaos, that God treads on the waves of the sea. Alternate translation: “the chaotic ocean waves”
9:13	e9gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תחת⁠ו שָׁ֝חֲח֗וּ	1	Job is speaking of **the helpers of Rahab**, most likely meaning the waves of the sea, as if they were a living thing that could **bow** to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “are under his control”
9:14	z61q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	**Indeed that** is an expression that indicates that what follows is greater in degree than what a person has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How much less would I be able to answer him”
9:14	j293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **will answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “How much less would a mere mortal such as I be able to answer him”
9:14	j294		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶבְחֲרָ֖ה דְבָרַ֣⁠י עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the expression **choose words** to mean by association arguing a case against God, since he would have to **choose** the right **words** in order to do that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “argue a case against him”
9:15	j295		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִם־צָ֭דַקְתִּי לֹ֣א אֶעֱנֶ֑ה	1	The pronoun **whom** refers to text. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Even if I were righteous, I would not try to answer God”
9:15	j296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־צָ֭דַקְתִּי	1	By **righteous**, in this context Job implicitly means being the unjustly injured party in a lawsuit. Your language may have an expression for this that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “if I were in the right”
9:15	j297		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ֝⁠מְשֹׁפְטִ֗⁠י אֶתְחַנָּֽן	1	Job implicitly means that he would plead to God as his **judge**. He is not talking about appealing to some other legal authority to judge between him and God. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I would plead for mercy to God as my judge”
9:16	j298		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַאֲזִ֥ין	1	Job is using the expression **giving ear** to mean listening, by association with the way that people listen with their ears. However, this specific expression has the sense of listening carefully, that is, paying attention. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he was paying attention to”
9:16	j299		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **voice**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I was saying”
9:17	w3dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠שְׂעָרָ֥ה	1	When Job says that God would send a **tempest** or violent storm to **break** (destroy) him if he challenged God, Job could be using the storm to represent various troubles that God would cause him to experience. However, since God does approach Job in a violent storm at the end of the book, it would be appropriate to retain the term **tempest** in your translation rather than interpret the term as symbolic.
9:18	j300		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לֹֽא־יִ֭תְּנֵ⁠נִי הָשֵׁ֣ב רוּחִ֑⁠י כִּ֥י יַ֝שְׂבִּעַ֗⁠נִי מַמְּרֹרִֽים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “He fills me with bitterness, and by doing that, he does not allow me to cause my breath to return”
9:18	bw17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הָשֵׁ֣ב רוּחִ֑⁠י	1	This expression means to rest in order to start breathing regularly again after exertion or extended speaking. Your language may have an expression for this that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to catch my breath”

9:19	fjk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י יוֹעִידֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “no one is able to summon him!”
9:20	xtf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶ֭צְדָּק	1	See how you translated the term **righteous** in [9:15](../09/15.md). In this context, the term **righteous** implicitly describes being the unjustly injured party in a lawsuit. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I were in the right”
9:20	grl2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פִּ֣⁠י יַרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he would say by using his mouth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I said would condemn me”

9:21	ruv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹֽא־אֵדַ֥ע נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י	1	In this context, the word **know** means to have regard for something or to be concerned about something.

9:22	ahw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַחַ֗ת הִ֥יא	1	The expression **It is one** could mean: (1) that God treats everyone in the same way.

So it may be more natural in your language to make this a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “that is why I have been saying that God destroys both the blameless and the wicked”
9:22	e1i7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תָּ֥ם וְ֝⁠רָשָׁ֗ע	1	Job is using the adjectives **blameless** and **wicked** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people.

If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has given the earth into the hand of the wicked” or “God has put the earth under the control of the wicked”
9:24	rz2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶ֤רֶץ ׀ נִתְּנָ֬ה	1	Job is using the term **earth** to mean by association the people who live on the earth.

9:24	y1iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם־לֹ֖א	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

As in the previous verse, he means that his days move very quickly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am running out of days as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water” or “Each of my days goes by as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water”

9:26	iuy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֹֽכֶל	1	Job is using a general term, **food**, to one specific kind of food, the kind an **eagle** would catch and eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “its prey”

9:28	j304		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לֹ֥א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	The pronoun **you** is singular because it refers to God rather than to the three friends. So use the second-person singular in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Even though to this point in this speech Job has been protesting that he cannot argue his case with God, here he addresses God directly, as he did in [7:7–21](../07/07.md) and as he will do later in this speech in [10:2–22](../10/02.md). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you, God, would not acquit me”
9:29	js2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אָנֹכִ֥י אֶרְשָׁ֑ע לָ⁠מָּה	1	This could mean: (1) that in order to convey emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means and convey the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “God thinks I am wicked! So why” (2) that without intending to convey emphasis, Job is describing how he believes God would regard him. Alternate translation: “Since God would consider me to be wicked anyway, why”
9:29	j305		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָנֹכִ֥י אֶרְשָׁ֑ע	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I am a wicked person”
9:29	w57l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ⁠מָּה־זֶּ֝֗ה הֶ֣בֶל אִיגָֽע	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “there is no reason for me to toil in vain”
9:29	j306		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֶ֣בֶל אִיגָֽע	1	By **toil**, Job implicitly means working hard to prove his innocence. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “would I work hard in vain to prove my innocence”

9:30	l6jt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְמֵי־שָׁ֑לֶג	1	The implication is that **water** from freshly melting **snow** is very pure. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “with very pure water”
9:30	a4jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠בֹ֣ר	1	The word **lye** describes a cleansing agent made from the ashes created by burning certain plants.

Alternate translation: “with a strong cleansing agent”
9:31	sz3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת תִּטְבְּלֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking hypothetically of something he believes God would do as a symbolic action to show that God considered him guilty rather than innocent.

9:31	j308		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תִּטְבְּלֵ֑⁠נִי	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is once again addressing God directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
9:31	j309		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת	1	By **a ditch**, Job implicitly means a ditch full of dirty water that would make his body dirty all over.

He means that the water in the ditch would make his body so dirty that his own clothes would not want to be on his body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my body would become very dirty”
9:33	j310		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	יָשֵׁ֖ת יָד֣⁠וֹ עַל־שְׁנֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	A judge would **lay his hand** on the opposing parties in a case as a symbolic action to show that he was bringing them both under his judicial authority. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “who would lay his hand upon the two of us to show that he had the authority to decide our case”
9:34	hm1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָסֵ֣ר מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י שִׁבְט֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠אֵמָת֗⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **who** refers to a judge who might decide Job’s case against God, and the pronoun **his** refers to God.

Alternate translation: “There is no judge who could turn God’s rod from upon me and God’s terror”
9:34	cc5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שִׁבְט֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally using a **rod** or stick to punish him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his punishment”

9:35	fa78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַֽ֭דַבְּרָה וְ⁠לֹ֣א אִירָאֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Job means implicitly that he would do these things if there were someone to judge between him and God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “If there were someone to judge between us, I would speak and I would not fear him”
9:35	j311			אַֽ֭דַבְּרָה	1	Job is using an emphatic verbal form. Your language may have a similar form that you could use in your translation. If not, you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “I would certainly speak”
9:35	ug86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־כֵ֥ן אָ֝נֹכִ֗י עִמָּדִֽ⁠י	1	Interpreters are unsure what this expression means. It could possibly mean: (1) Alternate translation: “That is not how things are with me at the moment” (2) Alternate translation: “I am not the kind of person who would do that now”
10:intro	ul99				0	# Job 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job finishes responding to Bildad’s first speech. As he did in chapter 7, Job speaks to God in light of his exchange with his friend, although in this case Job describes what he would say to God rather than addressing God directly.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Extended quotation\n\nStarting in verse 2 and continuing through the end of the chapter, Job quotes what he would say to God if he could argue his case with him. If your language would not naturally put one direct quotation inside another, you could translate what Job says as an indirect quotation. A note to verse 2 suggests how to start doing that. You could follow the same approach throughout the rest of the chapter.
10:1	ch7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נָֽקְטָ֥ה נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י & בְּ⁠מַ֣ר נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am weary … in my bitterness”
10:1	p5cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶֽעֶזְבָ֣ה עָלַ֣⁠י שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	In this expression, to **abandon** something **upon** oneself means not to restrain it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will complain without restraining myself”
10:2	j312		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֹמַ֣ר אֶל־אֱ֭לוֹהַּ אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי עַ֣ל מַה־תְּרִיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this is the beginning of a long quotation within a quotation. Job is telling his friends what he would like to tell God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this and the rest of the chapter so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I will tell God not to condemn me but to cause me to know for what he is accusing me”
10:2	j313		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֹמַ֣ר אֶל־אֱ֭לוֹהַּ אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי עַ֣ל מַה־תְּרִיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	If you decide to translate what Job says he would tell God as a direct quotation, you could indicate the start of the quotation with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation.
10:2	j314		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי	1	Job means implicitly that he does not want God to condemn him without letting him know why he is condemning him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Do not condemn me without causing me to know”
10:3	aaw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ט֤וֹב לְ⁠ךָ֨ ׀ כִּֽי־תַעֲשֹׁ֗ק כִּֽי־תִ֭מְאַס יְגִ֣יעַ כַּפֶּ֑י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not consider it good to oppress me, to despise the work of your hands, while you shine on the plans of the wicked!”
10:3	vw7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יְגִ֣יעַ כַּפֶּ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of working to make something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your own work”
10:3	q8wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	When Job says that God would **shine**, he means that God would have a glowing, approving expression on his face. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but on the plans of the wicked you smile”
10:3	j316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	Job is using one part of giving and showing approval, the act of visibly smiling, to mean the entire act of approving. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but you approve of what the wicked plan to do”
10:3	j315		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
10:4	j317		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the terms **eyes** and **seeing** to mean by association knowing and understanding, since people often discover things by seeing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you only know and understand the kinds of things that people can see with their eyes”
10:4	e9t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You do not have eyes of flesh! You do not see according to the seeing of a man!”
10:4	d65r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	Job is using the expression **of flesh** to mean “human,” by association with the way that humans have flesh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you have human eyes?” or “You do not have human eyes!”
10:4	s8ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “You do not see as people see, do you?”
10:4	j318		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “as people do”
10:5	st4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is asking implicitly whether God has the same number of **days** and **years** as a human being, not whether God experiences the kind of **days** and **years** that people do. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Is the number of your days the same as the number of the days that a man has, or is the number of your years the same as the number of days that a person has”
10:5	awt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations, not continuing this sentence into the following two verses. Alternate translation: “Your days are not like the days of a man! No, your years are not like the days of a person!”
10:5	j319		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the terms **days** and **years** to mean by association the lifetime of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the two phrases and state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you have as short a lifetime as people do” or “You do not have as short a lifetime as people do!”
10:5	j320		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ & גָֽבֶר	1	In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. Both of these masculine terms have a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a mortal … a human being”
10:5	j321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כִּ֣⁠ימֵי	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say “years” instead of **days** here. This would maintain a parallel between the two parts of this verse without making any significant change in meaning. (The original reading may have been “years”; many translations say that.) Alternate translation: “like the years of”
10:5	e5pg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Your years are not like the days of a man, are they?”
10:6	zdk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	In this verse and the previous one, Job seems to be asking implicitly whether God is seeking urgently to discover whether he has sinned because God has only a short time to live and God wants to discover this before he dies. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Is that why you seek for my iniquity and search for my sin”
10:6	j322		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express, to convey his sense that God is seeking urgently to find out whether he has sinned. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “that you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned” or “Is that why you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned”
10:6	j323		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. If you chose not to continue the sentence from the previous verse in order to translate the questions there as statements or exclamations, this would be a new sentence. You could also choose not to continue it into the next verse. Alternate translation: “You do not need to seek for my iniquity and search for my sin!”
10:7	s3k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַֽל־דַּ֭עְתְּ⁠ךָ כִּי־לֹ֣א אֶרְשָׁ֑ע וְ⁠אֵ֖ין מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣ מַצִּֽיל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. If you chose not to continue the sentence from the previous verse in order to translate the question there as a statement or as an exclamation, this would be a new sentence. Alternate translation: “After all, you know that I am not wicked, and there is no one rescuing me from your hand!”
10:7	j324		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַֽל־דַּ֭עְתְּ⁠ךָ	1	In this expression, **above** means “in addition to.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “even though you know that”
10:7	j325		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֖ין מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣ מַצִּֽיל	1	The implication seems to be that God does not need to seek urgently to discover whether Job has sinned, because Job cannot escape from God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and that I cannot escape from you”
10:7	vzd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of apprehending Job as a wrongdoer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from you”
10:8	p1ml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ עִ֭צְּבוּ⁠נִי וַֽ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֑וּ⁠נִי	1	The terms **formed** and **made** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Indeed, your hands created me”
10:8	tx92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of making Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You”
10:9	x1dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַ⁠חֹ֣מֶר עֲשִׂיתָ֑⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that God molded Job’s body as one molds clay to make things. Job is not saying that God made him to be like clay. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you molded my body as one molds clay”
10:9	zg5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְֽ⁠אֶל־עָפָ֥ר תְּשִׁיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “so please do not turn me into dust again!”
10:10	h664		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֣א כֶ֭⁠חָלָב תַּתִּיכֵ֑⁠נִי וְ֝⁠כַ⁠גְּבִנָּ֗ה תַּקְפִּיאֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have poured me like milk and caused me to curdle like cheese.”
10:10	c2ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	הֲ⁠לֹ֣א כֶ֭⁠חָלָב תַּתִּיכֵ֑⁠נִי וְ֝⁠כַ⁠גְּבִנָּ֗ה תַּקְפִּיאֵֽ⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that just as one pours out **milk** and curdles it to make **cheese**, so God has created Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are the one who has created me, just as one creates cheese out of milk”
10:11	j326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ע֣וֹר וּ֭⁠בָשָׂר תַּלְבִּישֵׁ֑⁠נִי וּֽ⁠בַ⁠עֲצָמ֥וֹת וְ֝⁠גִידִ֗ים תְּסֹכְכֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Ordinarily one builds the inside of something before its outside, so you might find it more natural to put the information about the **bones and tendons** before the information about the **skin and flesh**. Alternate translation: “You knit me together with bones and tendons and then you clothed me with skin and flesh”
10:11	p9pw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ע֣וֹר וּ֭⁠בָשָׂר תַּלְבִּישֵׁ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **clothed** him with **skin and flesh**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You have covered my body with skin and flesh”
10:11	mxm1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠בַ⁠עֲצָמ֥וֹת וְ֝⁠גִידִ֗ים תְּסֹכְכֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **knit** him **together** with **bones and tendons**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you have given me a supportive skeletal system of bones and tendons”
10:12	tc2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חַיִּ֣ים וָ֭⁠חֶסֶד עָשִׂ֣יתָ עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	The implication is that God made these things **alongside** Job so that they would accompany him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You caused life and covenant faithfulness to accompany me” or “You made sure that I would experience life and covenant faithfulness”
10:12	dt8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠פְקֻדָּתְ⁠ךָ֗	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **visitation**, you could express the same idea in another way. In this context, the word **visitation** does not indicate that God spent time with Job temporarily but that he was always present with him. Alternate translation: “and your presence”
10:12	h7in		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	רוּחִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **spirit**, to mean all of him, with an emphasis on him being alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “me” or “my life”
10:13	j327		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֭⁠אֵלֶּה צָפַ֣נְתָּ בִ⁠לְבָבֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **hid** certain **things** in his **heart**. Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Job means that God was secretly planning certain things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But you were secretly planning these things”
10:13	j328		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	זֹ֥את עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	The expression **this was with you** means “this is what you were thinking.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this is what you were thinking”
10:14	zj6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עֲוֺנִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this with a positive expression. Alternate translation: “and you would declare me guilty of my iniquity”
10:14	j329		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עֲוֺנִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	The implication is that God would punish Job for his **iniquity** if God did not **acquit** him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you would punish me for my iniquity”
10:15	j330		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אִם־רָשַׁ֡עְתִּי אַלְלַ֬י לִ֗⁠י וְ֭⁠צָדַקְתִּי לֹא־אֶשָּׂ֣א רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י שְׂבַ֥ע קָ֝ל֗וֹן וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה עָנְיִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the phrase **I will not lift my head** at the end of this verse, since the material that follows this phrase gives the reason for the result that it describes. Alternate translation: “And even if I am righteous, because I am nevertheless full of disgrace—yes, see my affliction!—I will not lift my head”
10:15	h2sc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לֹא־אֶשָּׂ֣א רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is saying that he would not **lift** his **head** (that is, he would look down) as a symbolic action to express that he was feeling shame. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. There may be some physical gesture with the same meaning in your culture that you could use in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “I will still look down in shame” or “I will still cover my eyes in shame” or “I will still act ashamed”
10:15	amu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שְׂבַ֥ע קָ֝ל֗וֹן	1	For emphasis, Job is speaking of himself as if he were a container that **disgrace** could fill. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I feel very disgraced”
10:15	bu5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה עָנְיִֽ⁠י	1	The imperative **see** is singular because Job is addressing God, not his three friends. So use the second-person singular in your translation if your language marks that distinction. It may also be helpful to specify the addressee. Alternate translation: “Yes, God, see my affliction”
10:15	fs2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה	1	Job is using the term **see** to mean “consider” by association with the way people consider things that they are looking at. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, consider”
10:16	z3nm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ֭⁠יִגְאֶה	1	The pronoun **it** refers to Job’s head, which in the previous verse he said he would not lift. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And should my head arise”
10:16	j331		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֭⁠יִגְאֶה	1	Job is speaking of his **head** as if it were a living thing that could **arise** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And should I raise my head” or “And if I did raise my head”
10:16	bss8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַל תְּצוּדֵ֑⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **lion** stalks its prey relentlessly, so, Job is saying, God would stalk him relentlessly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “you would stalk me as relentlessly as a lion stalks its prey”
10:16	yj7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠תָשֹׁ֗ב תִּתְפַּלָּא־בִֽ⁠י	1	In this expression, the word **return** means to do something again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and once again you would distinguish yourself against me”
10:16	j332		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠תָשֹׁ֗ב תִּתְפַּלָּא־בִֽ⁠י	1	Job means implicitly that God would **distinguish** himself by punishing Job in spectacular ways. ([Exodus 3:20](../03/20.md) uses the same verb to describe the plagues that God sent against the Egyptians.) You could indicate this meaning in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you would do further great things to punish me” or “you would punish me further in spectacular ways”
10:17	u754		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תְּחַדֵּ֬שׁ עֵדֶ֨י⁠ךָ ׀ נֶגְדִּ֗⁠י	1	In this verse, Job continues to describe what he believes God would do if he were to “lift” his “head” (that is, if he were to act as if he had nothing to be ashamed of), as he said in [10:15](../10/15.md). Job could be using the word **witnesses** here to mean: (1) accusations that God would make against Job, as if God were literally a witness testifying against Job in a trial. Alternate translation: “You would accuse me of doing further wrong things” (2) sufferings that God would cause Job to experience, since people in this culture believed that sufferings were evidence that God was punishing someone for doing wrong. Alternate translation: “You would cause me to suffer even more”
10:17	di4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	חֲלִיפ֖וֹת וְ⁠צָבָ֣א עִמִּֽ⁠י	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. Job is using the word **changes** to indicate that he feels that God is sending one **army** after another against him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “you keep sending new armies against me”
10:17	zs8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֲלִיפ֖וֹת וְ⁠צָבָ֣א עִמִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God is literally sending one **army** after another against him. He means that he feels that God keeps attacking him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you keep attacking me”
10:18	j333		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לָ֣⁠מָּה מֵ֭⁠רֶחֶם הֹצֵאתָ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

10:20	j336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַבְלִ֥יגָה מְּעָֽט	1	Job is not asking God to **let** him **smile a little**; rather, Job is saying what he would do if God stopped making him suffer.

11:intro	m1vt				0	# Job 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Zophar responds to what Job said in chapters 9 and 10.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Zophar answering Job with his own words\n\n- In [9:12](../09/12.md), Job asked about God, when suggesting that God might act cruelly, “Who will turn him back?” Zophar says in his response in [11:10](../11/10.md), answering Job in his own words to insist that God actually acts justly, ”Who will turn him back?”\n\n- In [10:15](../10/15.md), Job says that he will not lift his head, he will continue to act ashamed, because God is punishing him even though he is innocent. Zophar says in response in [11:15](../11/15.md) that if Job repents and prays for forgiveness, he will be able to lift up his face without any shame.\n\n- In [10:22](../10/2.md), Job says that he will die and go to a place of complete darkness. Zophar says in response in [11:17](../11/17.md) that Job’s life may seem like darkness now, but it will become bright and happy if he turns to God.\n\nTo help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Zophar’s expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier. Notes will suggest ways to do this.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Zophar uses the question form in order to challenge Job. Your language might not use the question form for that purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Alternate translation: “I wish that God would speak and open his lips against you”
11:5	j355		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן אֱל֣וֹהַּ דַּבֵּ֑ר וְ⁠יִפְתַּ֖ח שְׂפָתָ֣י⁠ו עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	The expressions **speak** and **open his lips** mean similar things.

Alternate translation: “God’s wisdom is double to your understanding” or “God’s wisdom is twice as great as your understanding”
11:6	j357		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּֽי־כִפְלַ֪יִם לְֽ⁠ת֫וּשִׁיָּ֥ה	1	By the expression **double**, Zophar actually means much greater.

Alternate translation: “But an empty man will never get a heart, any more than the colt of a wild donkey would ever be born to a man”
11:12	j367		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אִ֣ישׁ נָ֭בוּב	1	Zophar is speaking as if a **man** could literally be **empty** or hollow inside. He means that such a person lacks wisdom.

Alternate translation: “and a man will be the father of a wild-donkey colt”
11:13	j369		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־אַ֭תָּ֗ה הֲכִינ֣וֹתָ לִבֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	For emphasis, Zophar is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **prepare**. Zophar is drawing a contrast between what he is suggesting here that Job might do and what the “empty man” he described in the previous verse would not be able to do. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “But as for you, if you prepare your heart”
11:13	k56l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־אַ֭תָּ֗ה הֲכִינ֣וֹתָ לִבֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	In this instance, the **heart** represents a person’s will. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you resolve to trust God”

11:14	t8z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־אָ֣וֶן בְּ֭⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ הַרְחִיקֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Zophar is speaking as if **iniquity** were literally an object that Job could be holding in his **hand** and that Job could **put it far away**. Zophar means that Job might be committing iniquity and that if he has, he should stop. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if you have been committing iniquity, stop doing that”
11:14	u5ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠אַל־תַּשְׁכֵּ֖ן בְּ⁠אֹהָלֶ֣י⁠ךָ עַוְלָֽה	1	Zophar is speaking of **unrighteousness** as if it were a living thing that could **dwell** in the same **tents** in which Job and his household are living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The word **tents** could be: (1) an image for Job’s whole life. Alternate translation: “yes, be sure that you are not practicing any unrighteousness” (2) a reference to Job’s household.

11:14	j370		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠אַל־תַּשְׁכֵּ֖ן בְּ⁠אֹהָלֶ֣י⁠ךָ עַוְלָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **unrighteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “yes, be sure that you are not doing anything that is not righteous”
11:15	db84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	תִּשָּׂ֣א פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ מִ⁠מּ֑וּם	1	Zophar is suggesting that Job would be able to **lift** his **face** without being concerned that any **blemish** would show as symbolic action to indicate that he was not ashamed of anything. Job said in [10:15](../10/15.md) that he could not do this, and so Zophar is answering Job with his own words. To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate this expression similarly to the way you translated the comparable expression in [10:15](../10/15.md). Alternate translation: “you will no longer need to look down in shame”
11:15	j371		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠מּ֑וּם	1	Zophar is speaking as if Job might literally have a **blemish** on his face and that it would go away if Job prayed to God. The blemish actually represents a cause for shame. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without feeling any shame”
11:15	j372		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הָיִ֥יתָ מֻ֝צָ֗ק	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who will do the action, the context suggests that it will be God. Alternate translation: “and God will establish you”
11:15	j373		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א תִירָֽא	1	Zophar seems to mean implicitly that Job will not have to **fear** any further punishment from God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you will not be afraid that God will punish you anymore”
11:16	x6vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠מַ֖יִם עָבְר֣וּ תִזְכֹּֽר	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **waters pass by** (flowing down a river, for example) and are gone, so Job’s **trouble** will be gone and he will not **remember** it at all. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “you will not remember it at all, just as the water in a river flows by and is never seen again”
11:17	j374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּֽ֭⁠מִ⁠צָּהֳרַיִם יָק֣וּם חָ֑לֶד	1	Zophar is using the term **noon** by association to mean the sun at noon, that is, the sun when it is highest and brightest in the sky. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And life will arise higher than the noonday sun”
11:17	dkt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ֭⁠מִ⁠צָּהֳרַיִם יָק֣וּם חָ֑לֶד	1	Zophar is speaking of Job’s **life** as if it were literally an object like the sun that could **arise** into the sky. By saying that Job’s life will rise into the sky even higher than the sun at noon, he means that it will be very bright. The brightness, in turn, represents happy thriving. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And your life will become very happy again, as if it were brighter than the noonday sun”
11:17	dua9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תָּ֝עֻ֗פָ⁠ה כַּ⁠בֹּ֥קֶר תִּהְיֶֽה	1	In a poetic parallel, Zophar is once again using light, in this instance the light of **dawn**, to represent happiness. This contrasts with Job’s present misery, which Zophar represents as **darkness**. Zophar is once again answering Job with his own words. The term translated **darkness** here is from the same root as the term that the ULT translates as “obscurity” in [10:22](../10/22.md). To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate the term here the same way you translated it there. Alternate translation: “the misery of your life may feel like obscurity now, but it will change into happiness, just as dawn changes darkness into light”
11:18	iqu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠חָפַרְתָּ֗	1	Zophar means implicitly that Job will **look around** and see that there is no danger. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you will look around and see that there is no danger”
11:18	f1be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠בֶ֥טַח תִּשְׁכָּֽב	1	Zophar is referring implicitly to when Job would **lie down** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Your language may have its own expression that you could use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “you will lie down to sleep in safety” or “you will go to bed in safety”
11:18	hc18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לָ⁠בֶ֥טַח תִּשְׁכָּֽב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **safety**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “you will lie down safely”
11:19	fm2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ֭⁠רָבַצְתָּ	1	Zophar once again means implicitly that Job would **recline** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Yes, you will lie down to sleep for the night”
11:19	j375		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠חִלּ֖וּ פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ רַבִּֽים	1	Zophar is speaking as if **many** people would literally **stroke** Job’s **face**, as someone would do who was trying to make someone else favorable to him. Zophar means that Job would become influential again and people would seek his favor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “many people will seek your favor”
11:20	s359		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י רְשָׁעִ֗ים תִּ֫כְלֶ֥ינָה	1	Zophar is referring to death by association with the way people’s eyes **fail** when they are about to die (either in the sense of becoming visibly dim or in the sense of no longer seeing well). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But the wicked will die”
11:20	j376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וּ֭⁠מָנוֹס אָבַ֣ד מִנְ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Zophar is speaking of **escape** as if it were a living thing that could **perish**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, they will not be able to escape dying”
11:20	j377		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠תִקְוָתָ֗⁠ם מַֽפַּח־נָֽפֶשׁ	1	Zophar is using the phrase **expiration of breath**, which means “breathing out,” to mean dying. This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “they will have no hope other than to pass away” or “they will have no hope other than to die”
12:intro	u4jn				0	# Job 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the start of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech. (Job’s response to him continues in chapters 13 and 14.)\n- Verses 1–6: Job speaks to all three of his friends and protests that they have not been telling him anything that he does not already know\n- Verses 7–12: Job speaks specifically to Zophar and insists that what Zophar has just said in his speech is common knowledge in the world and something that he himself knows.\n- Verses 13–25: Job describes how God is so powerful that no one can resist what he does.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Plural and singular “you”\n\nThe pronoun “you” is plural in verses 1–3 because Job is addressing all three of his friends. The pronoun “you” is singular in verses 7–8 because Job is addressing Zophar. Use the plural and singular forms in these places if your language marks that distinction.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 13–24, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n> With him {are} wisdom and might; to him {are} counsel and understanding.\n> Behold, he breaks down, and it is not rebuilt; he closes upon a man, and it is not opened.\n> Behold, he withholds the waters and they dry up, and he sends them out and they overthrow the land.\n> With him {are} strength and prudence; to him {are} the one straying and the one causing to stray;\n> the one leading counselors away naked, and he makes judges foolish.\n> He removes the bond of kings and he wraps a cloth around their loins;\n> the one leading priests away naked, and the incumbent ones he overthrows,\n> the one removing the lip {that is} to the ones being trusted, and he takes away the discernment of the elders,\n> the one pouring contempt on nobles, and the belt of the mighty ones he loosens,\n> the one revealing deep things out of darkness, and he brings dark shadow into the light,\n> the one magnifying nations, and he destroys them; the one enlarging nations, and he exiles them,\n> the one removing a heart from the leaders of the people of the earth; he causes them to wander in a wasteland {with} no path.\n> They grope in darkness and not in light; he makes them wander like a drunkard.
12:2	dpz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אָ֭מְנָם כִּ֣י אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם וְ֝⁠עִמָּ⁠כֶ֗ם תָּמ֥וּת חָכְמָֽה	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You are speaking as if you were the people and as if wisdom would with you, but that is not true”
12:2	dk3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is plural here and in the next two verses because Job is referring to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have other ways to indicate the plural reference. Alternate translation: “the three of you are the people”
12:2	xl1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם	1	Job could be saying (while meaning the opposite): (1) that his three friends are so wise that their opinion is the one that really matters. Alternate translation: “you are the people whose opinion matters” (2) that in their counsel, his three friends are embodying the collective wisdom of their people. Alternate translation: “you have expressed the wisdom of our whole people”
12:2	j378		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠עִמָּ⁠כֶ֗ם תָּמ֥וּת חָכְמָֽה	1	Job is speaking of **wisdom** as if it were a living thing that could **die**. He is saying (while meaning the opposite) that his friends are the only people who are truly wise and so there will be no wisdom left on earth once they die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and indeed, you are the only wise people on earth”
12:3	j379		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּם־לִ֤⁠י לֵבָ֨ב ׀ כְּֽמוֹ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts, and in this context, specifically wise thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have wisdom just as you do”
12:3	j380		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־נֹפֵ֣ל אָנֹכִ֣י מִ⁠כֶּ֑ם	1	Job is using this expression to mean that he is not inferior to his friends. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I do not fall short of you” or “I am not inferior to you”
12:3	kd9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אֶת־מִי־אֵ֥ין כְּמוֹ־אֵֽלֶּה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Indeed, such things as these are with everyone.”
12:3	j381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֶת־מִי־אֵ֥ין כְּמוֹ־אֵֽלֶּה	1	Job is using this expression to mean that everyone knows the things that his friends have been saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And everyone knows such things as these” or “And everyone knows the things that you have been saying”
12:4	qdq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	שְׂחֹ֤ק לְ⁠רֵעֵ֨⁠הוּ ׀ אֶֽהְיֶ֗ה קֹרֵ֣א לֶ֭⁠אֱלוֹהַּ וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Job is actually using the pronouns **him** and **his** to refer to himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this using first-person pronouns. Alternate translation: “Even though God used to answer me when I called on him, now I have become laughter to my neighbor”
12:4	f67d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְׂחֹ֤ק	1	Job is using the term **laughter** by association to mean an object of laughter, that is, of derision. Your language may have an expression that you could use in your translation to convey this meaning. Alternate translation: “a laughingstock”
12:4	j382		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׂ֝ח֗וֹק צַדִּ֥יק תָּמִֽים	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I, a just and blameless man, have become a laughingstock!”
12:5	cg28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	שַׁאֲנָ֑ן	1	Job is using the adjective **secure** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are secure”
12:5	z8za		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נָ֝כ֗וֹן לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדֵי רָֽגֶל	1	Job is speaking of certain people as if their **foot** was literally **slipping** and they were about to fall down. Job is likely describing people who are struggling with difficulties, and he is saying that people who are **secure** believe that they are struggling because God is punishing them for their sins. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They believe that when people struggle in life, that is because God is punishing them for their sins”
12:5	j6ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	נָ֝כ֗וֹן	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They think that it is prepared”
12:5	j383		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נָ֝כ֗וֹן	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They think that God has prepared it”
12:6	j384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִשְׁלָ֤יוּ אֹֽהָלִ֨ים ׀ לְ⁠שֹׁ֥דְדִ֗ים	1	Job is speaking of the **tents** of these **robbers** as if they were living things that could **prosper**. By referring to one valuable possession of the robbers, Job means that the robbers themselves prosper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Robbers live in prosperity”
12:6	j385		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	וּֽ֭⁠בַטֻּחוֹת	1	Job is using the plural form **securities** to indicate that these **provokers of God** experience security to a supreme extent. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “and complete security is”
12:6	j8fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֵבִ֖יא אֱל֣וֹהַּ בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that a person has over something. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “to the person who thinks that he has God in his pocket” or “to the person who thinks he has more control over his life than God does”
12:7-8	c1y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In [11:9](../11/09.md), Zophar used the two main components of creation, the earth and the sea, to mean all of creation. Here in [12:7–8](../07/08.md), Job is responding to Zophar in his own words. Job's language is more extensive, and so it is more emphatic. Job is using the inhabitants of three components of creation (the beasts of the land, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea), along with the earth itself, to mean all of creation. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 7–8. It might say something like this: “You can go anywhere in creation and ask a creature—even ask the earth itself—about God’s ways, and that creature will be able to explain them to you”
12:7	de2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א בְהֵמ֣וֹת וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וְ⁠ע֥וֹף הַ֝⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is using an imperative sentence to tell the condition under which something would happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this as a conditional sentence. Alternate translation: “But now if you asked the beasts, one of them would teach you, and if you asked the birds of the heavens, one of them would declare to you”
12:7	j496		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א בְהֵמ֣וֹת וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וְ⁠ע֥וֹף הַ֝⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if Zophar could literally have a conversation with **beasts** and **birds**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you actually could ask the beasts, one of them would teach you, and if you actually could ask the birds of the heavens, one of them would declare to you”
12:7	t82w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א	1	The pronoun **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative verb (**ask**) are singular here and in the next verse because Job is speaking directly to one of his friends. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Job is probably addressing Zophar, since he said in [11:8–9](../11/08.md) that Job could search through all of creation and still not comprehend the wisdom of God. Job is saying in response that God’s ways are common knowledge to animals and birds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “But now, Zophar, ask”
12:7	j386		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ & וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job means implicitly that the **beasts** and **birds** would **teach** and **declare** God’s ways.

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “ask the birds of the heavens”
12:8	k4ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	א֤וֹ שִׂ֣יחַ לָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Job is using an imperative sentence to tell the condition under which something would happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this as a conditional sentence. Alternate translation: “Or if you spoke to the earth, then it would teach you; the fish of the sea would recount to you”
12:8	g5xs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	א֤וֹ שִׂ֣יחַ לָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Job is continuing to speak as if Zophar could literally have a conversation with the **earth** and with **fish**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you could actually speak to the earth, it would teach you. If you could have a conversation with the fish of the sea, they would recount to you”
12:8	j388		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Once again Job means implicitly that the **earth** and the **fish** would **teach** and **recount** God’s ways. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and it will teach you God’s ways; the fish of the sea will recount God’s ways to you”
12:8	bjf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “or ask the fish of the sea, and they will recount to you”
12:9	hu2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֭י לֹא־יָדַ֣ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֵ֑לֶּה כִּ֥י יַד־יְ֝הוָה עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “All of these know that the hand of Yahweh has done this!”
12:9	j389		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מִ֭י לֹא־יָדַ֣ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֵ֑לֶּה	1	Job is speaking of the creatures he described in the previous two verses as if they could **know** what Yahweh has done. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Which of all these creatures could not tell you, if you could actually have a conversation with them,”
12:9	tht3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַד־יְ֝הוָה עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that someone has over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh has done this by his own power”
12:9	j390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת	1	In context, the word **this** likely refers to the misfortune that Job is suffering. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has caused my misfortune”
12:10	tx1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ֭⁠יָד⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that someone has over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He has power over”
12:10	j391		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to emphasize something that is included in the previous phrase, not to introduce something additional. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation, preceded by a comma: “including the breath of all flesh of man”
12:10	s1sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	Job is using the term **breath** by association to mean “life.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the life of all flesh of man”
12:10	j392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	Job is using one part of **man**, his **flesh**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the life of every man”
12:10	j393		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “and the life of every woman and man” or “and the life of every person”
12:11	j394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	הֲ⁠לֹא־אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to say that the phrase it introduces is just as true as the previous phrase. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Does not the ear test words, just as the palate tastes its food?”
12:11	d5vn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

He is using the ear to represent hearing, and he means that people themselves test or consider the words of others when they hear them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do people not consider others’ words when they hear them, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food” 
12:11	j396		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלִּ֣ין	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what people say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what people say”
12:11	j397		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠לֹא־אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Though Job is making a general statement, he is referring implicitly to what his friends have said to him and what he has decided about it. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have heard what you have said and I have considered it and decided that it is not true, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”
12:11	j398		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of the **palate** or mouth as if it could **taste** by itself. He means that with their mouths, people discern the taste of the food that they eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”
12:12	j399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בִּֽ⁠ישִׁישִׁ֥ים חָכְמָ֑ה וְ⁠אֹ֖רֶךְ יָמִ֣ים תְּבוּנָֽה	1	Though Job is making another general statement in this verse, he is referring implicitly to himself as someone who has acquired much wisdom through long experience. The further implication is that although Zophar challenged him in [11:8](../11/8.md) by asking, “What will you know?” Job is insisting here that he actually does know a lot about life. You could indicate these things in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have lived a long time and I have acquired much wisdom through experience, so I actually do know a lot about life”
12:12	v4ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בִּֽ⁠ישִׁישִׁ֥ים חָכְמָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “The aged are wise”
12:12	j400		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בִּֽ⁠ישִׁישִׁ֥ים	1	Job is using the adjective **aged** as a noun to mean people of a certain kind. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “With aged people” or “With older people”
12:12	lhn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֹ֖רֶךְ יָמִ֣ים תְּבוּנָֽה	1	The expression **length of days** means a long life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, people who have lived a long life have understanding”
12:13	mmb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ חָכְמָ֣ה וּ⁠גְבוּרָ֑ה ל֝֗⁠וֹ עֵצָ֥ה וּ⁠תְבוּנָֽה	1	The pronoun **him** refers in each instance to God. Job is no longer referring to an “aged” person, as in the previous verse. Instead, he is describing what he knows about God as someone who has lived a long time and acquired much wisdom. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “I know that God has wisdom and might; I know that God has counsel and understanding”
12:13	tw4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ חָכְמָ֣ה וּ⁠גְבוּרָ֑ה ל֝֗⁠וֹ עֵצָ֥ה וּ⁠תְבוּנָֽה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **wisdom**, **might**, **counsel**, and **understanding**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God is wise and mighty; he understands everything and knows what to do”

In that sense, while it sounds as if Job is praising God, at the same time, Job is also complaining somewhat about God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God has so much knowledge and power that no human can resist him; God does not explain to anyone how he understands a situation or what he is going to do about it”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “if he breaks down, then it is not rebuilt; if he closes upon a man, then it is not opened”
12:14	v1pt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִבָּנֶ֑ה & וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִפָּתֵֽחַ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:14	j403		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִסְגֹּ֥ר עַל־אִ֝֗ישׁ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִפָּתֵֽחַ	1	In this context, the expressions **closes upon** and **opened** refer to imprisonment and release. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he imprisons a man, and that man is not released” or “if he imprisons a man, then no one releases that man”
12:14	j495		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אִ֝֗ישׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a man or woman” or “a person”
12:15	pl3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	הֵ֤ן יַעְצֹ֣ר בַּ⁠מַּ֣יִם וְ⁠יִבָ֑שׁוּ וִֽ֝⁠ישַׁלְּחֵ֗⁠ם וְ⁠יַ֖הַפְכוּ אָֽרֶץ	1	In both of these instances, Job is using the word **and** to introduce what happens under the condition he is describing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “if he withholds the waters, then they dry up; if he sends them out, then they overthrow the land”
12:15	rel2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יַ֖הַפְכוּ אָֽרֶץ	1	Job is speaking as if the **waters** would literally **overthrow** the **land** or turn it upside down. He means that the waters would completely cover the land so that there would be no land any more. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they completely flood the land”
12:16	gqf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ עֹ֣ז וְ⁠תֽוּשִׁיָּ֑ה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **strength** and **prudence**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God is strong and prudent”
12:16	uuh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	Job is speaking of people who are not living in the right way as if they were **straying** or going off the path that they should be walking on. He is speaking of people who persuade others to do wrong things as if they were **causing** them to **stray**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who do not live right and those who persuade others not to live right”
12:16	j404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ל֝֗⁠וֹ שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	The implication is that if someone is **straying** or doing wrong, that person cannot excuse his actions by saying that someone else persuaded him to do them. The person who chose to do wrong is accountable to God, and anyone who persuaded him to do those wrong is also accountable to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “those who do wrong and those who persuade them to do wrong are both accountable to God”
12:16	j405		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ל֝֗⁠וֹ שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	Job is using two complementary types of people to mean all people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “everyone is accountable to God for what they do and for what they persuade others to do”
12:17	ux12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God leads counselors away naked”
12:17	lk8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	To lead someone away **naked**, as victorious armies did to prisoners of war at this time, was a symbolic action that demonstrated that the conqueror had deprived the captive of his former status in his culture. In the case of a royal **counselor**, his power and authority were previously represented by his robe of office. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “God takes away from counselors the robes that represent the authority and power of their office”
12:17	j406		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	Job is speaking as if God literally leads **counselors** away **naked**. He means that God’s wisdom is so great that it discredits the wisdom of even the wisest humans, as if to put them out of office. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s wisdom is so great that it discredits the wisdom of even the wisest humans”
12:17	uu39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ⁠שֹׁפְטִ֥ים יְהוֹלֵֽל	1	The implication is probably that God makes **judges** seem **foolish** by being so much wiser than they are, and not that God affects the minds of judges so that they can no longer think intelligently. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and God makes judges seem foolish by being so much wiser than they are”
12:18	j407		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מוּסַ֣ר מְלָכִ֣ים פִּתֵּ֑חַ	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that **kings** might put a **bond** (that is, shackles) on someone to make him a prisoner, but God can set that person free. Alternate translation: “A king may imprison someone, but God can set that person free” (2) that kings may be wearing some symbol of royal authority as a **bond** (that is, as something bound around their bodies), such as a sash or chain, but God takes away their authority and removes this symbol of it. This meaning would be similar to what Job said in the previous verse about God removing counselors’ robes of authority. Alternate translation: “God strips kings of their royal sashes” or “God removes the chains of royal authority that kings are wearing”
12:18	w5lc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוּסַ֣ר מְלָכִ֣ים פִּתֵּ֑חַ	1	Whether this refers to God removing shackles from people whom kings have imprisoned or God removing symbols of royal authority that kings are wearing, it is a symbolic action that demonstrates that God is taking away kings’ authority. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “He takes away kings’ authority”
12:18	p4c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יֶּאְסֹ֥ר אֵ֝ז֗וֹר בְּ⁠מָתְנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	To wrap a **cloth** around someone’s **loins** is to make them dress as a slave would.

12:19	mkn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוֹלִ֣יךְ כֹּהֲנִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [12:17](../12/17.md). Alternate translation: “God takes away from priests the robes that represent the authority and power of their office”
12:19	ch3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠אֵֽתָנִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **incumbent** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The term is plural; the ULT shows this by adding the word **ones**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and people who are long established in their positions”
12:20	g3na		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵסִ֣יר שָׂ֭פָה לְ⁠נֶאֱמָנִ֑ים	1	Job is using the term **lip** by association to mean speech. He is using speech, in turn, to mean what these **trusted** people say, that is, the advice that they give. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God discredits the advice of the ones being trusted”
12:20	dk1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֵסִ֣יר שָׂ֭פָה לְ⁠נֶאֱמָנִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:21	l74e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שׁוֹפֵ֣ךְ בּ֭וּז עַל־נְדִיבִ֑ים	1	For emphasis, Job is speaking as if **contempt** were a liquid that God could literally pour on **nobles**. He means that God makes these princes lose the respect of others and experience complete contempt from them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in another way. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God completely disgraces nobles”
12:21	k6sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מְזִ֖יחַ אֲפִיקִ֣ים רִפָּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **loosens** the **belt** of **mighty ones**, that is, as if these mighty people tie up their robes so that they can do strenuous things, but God loosens their robes again so that they can not do those things. Job means that God is so strong that when he acts, even the strongest people are shown to be weak by comparison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and God is so strong that when he acts, even the strongest people are shown to be weak by comparison”
12:21	j408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֲפִיקִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God reveals deep things that are obscure to humans; yes, he helps people understand things that are unclear”
12:22	c31p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מְגַלֶּ֣ה עֲ֭מֻקוֹת מִנִּי־חֹ֑שֶׁךְ	1	Job is speaking as if things that are difficult to understand are literally **deep**, that is, far underground where people cannot see them or reach them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one revealing the truth about things that are difficult to understand”
12:22	j409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עֲ֭מֻקוֹת	1	Job is using the adjective **deep** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing.

Alternate translation: “things that are profound”
12:24	n4ta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֵ֭ב	1	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “understanding”
12:24	w1re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ֝⁠יַּתְעֵ֗⁠ם בְּ⁠תֹ֣הוּ לֹא־דָֽרֶךְ	1	Job is speaking as if God literally makes leaders **wander in a wasteland**.

12:25	x7t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְמַֽשְׁשׁוּ־חֹ֥שֶׁךְ וְ⁠לֹא־א֑וֹר	1	Job is speaking as if these leaders whose understanding God takes away literally **grope in darkness**, as if there were no **light** by which they could see where to go.

12:25	a21u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וַ֝⁠יַּתְעֵ֗⁠ם כַּ⁠שִּׁכּֽוֹר	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **drunkard** will wander in various directions without knowing where he is going, so these leaders will do one thing after another without being able to make a definite, correct plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “he makes them act aimlessly, just as a drunkard wanders aimlessly”
13:intro	x1ub				0	# Job 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.\n- Verses 1–19: Job complains to his friends that they have been speaking about him unfairly\n- Verses 20–28: Job begins to plead his case to God. He asks God to stop punishing him and to reveal any sins that are causing God to punish him with such great suffering.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n##Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### singular and plural “you”\n\nThe words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are all plural in verses 1–19 because in those verses Job is addressing his three friends. These forms are singular in verses 20–28 because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the appropriate forms in these different parts of the chapter.\n\n### “lift his face” (verse 8), “hide your face” (verse 24)\n\nThese expressions reflect a cultural practice. In this culture, the subject of a king would look humbly down at the ground when he came into the king’s presence. If the king was pleased with him, the king would “lift his face,” that is, get him to look up (for example, with a finger under his chin, or with a verbal command) to indicate that he could look at the king directly. In this way the king would be showing that he favored this subject. A reference to lifting someone’s face came to mean showing favoritism towards that person. That is the meaning in verse 8, where Job says that his friends are not considering his case fairly but instead showing partiality towards God. Similarly, if someone “hid his face” from someone (that is, turned his face away so that he was not looking at the person), that would be a sign that he was not pleased with the person. The expression “hide the face” came to mean “show disfavor,” even if someone was not literally looking away from someone else. That is what Job means in verse 24 when he asks God, “Why do you hide your face?” Notes to these verses suggest ways of translating these expressions.
13:1	d8w1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כֹּ֭ל רָאֲתָ֣ה עֵינִ֑⁠י שָֽׁמְעָ֥ה אָ֝זְנִ֗⁠י וַ⁠תָּ֥בֶן לָֽ⁠הּ	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. He uses another part of himself, his **ear**, to mean all of him in the act of hearing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I myself have seen all; I myself have heard and understood it”
13:1	q1yi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כֹּ֭ל	1	Job is using the word **all** to mean everything that his friends have told him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “all that the three of you have told me”
13:2	cq6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	כְּֽ֭⁠דַעְתְּ⁠כֶם & מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	The word **you** is plural here and through verse 13 because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
13:2	j410		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָדַ֣עְתִּי גַם־אָ֑נִי לֹא־נֹפֵ֖ל אָנֹכִ֣י	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the words translated **know** and **falling**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis, for example, by using the intensive pronoun “myself.” Alternate translation: “I myself also know. I myself am not falling”
13:2	lcm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹא־נֹפֵ֖ל אָנֹכִ֣י מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [12:3](../12/03.md). Alternate translation: “I do not fall short of you” or “I am not inferior to you”
13:3	mx6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	אֲ֭נִי אֶל־שַׁדַּ֣י אֲדַבֵּ֑ר	1	Job is using this future statement to express a wish.

13:4	f979		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַתֶּ֥ם טֹֽפְלֵי־שָׁ֑קֶר	1	Job is speaking as if his friends were literally plastering him with a **lie**, that is, coating him with untruth as if they were plastering a surface with it. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “you are smearing me with lies”
13:4	p89c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רֹפְאֵ֖י אֱלִ֣ל כֻּלְּ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends were literally doctors or **healers** who were trying to cure him of a disease but were failing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “none of you have helped me at all by what you have said”
13:5	gp7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִֽי־יִ֭תֵּן הַחֲרֵ֣שׁ תַּחֲרִישׁ֑וּ⁠ן	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: “I wish that being silent, you would be silent!”
13:5	j411		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הַחֲרֵ֣שׁ תַּחֲרִישׁ֑וּ⁠ן	1	Job is repeating a verb that means to **be silent** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “you would be completely silent”
13:5	t33j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠תְהִ֖י לָ⁠כֶ֣ם לְ⁠חָכְמָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “That would be the wisest thing you could do”

13:8	i61h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠אֵ֥ל תְּרִיבֽוּ⁠ן	1	Job is using the word **plead** to mean “argue a court case.” He is suggesting that his friends are not counseling him impartially but, rather, taking God’s side against him even though, as he sees it, he has a valid case against God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will you take God’s side against me?” or “you are taking God’s side against me!”

Alternate translation: “It is not good that he will examine you! You will not deceive him as you might deceive a man”
13:9	j412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ֭⁠טוֹב כִּֽי־יַחְקֹ֣ר אֶתְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Job means implicitly that it would not be **good** for his friends if God were to **examine** them because God would discover that they had not been telling the truth about him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “If God were to examine you, he would discover that you have not been telling the truth about him, and that would not be good for you”
13:9	gk9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בֶּ֝⁠אֱנ֗וֹשׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a man or a woman” or “a human”
13:10	j413		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	הוֹכֵ֣חַ יוֹכִ֣יחַ אֶתְ⁠כֶ֑ם אִם־בַּ֝⁠סֵּ֗תֶר פָּנִ֥ים תִּשָּׂאֽוּ⁠ן	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “If in secret you were lifting faces, reproving, he would reprove you”
13:10	ecs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הוֹכֵ֣חַ יוֹכִ֣יחַ	1	Job is repeating the verb **reprove** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “He would certainly reprove”
13:10	g5lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פָּנִ֥ים תִּשָּׂאֽוּ⁠ן	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:8](../13/08.md). Alternate translation: “you were showing favoritism”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “His majesty would certainly terrify you and the dread of him would certainly fall on you!”
13:11	e6x9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וּ֝⁠פַחְדּ֗⁠וֹ יִפֹּ֥ל עֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking of **dread** as if it were a living thing that could actively **fall** on his friends, either in the sense of overwhelming them or of assailing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and would you not become extremely afraid of him”
13:12	s8ny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 זִֽ֭כְרֹנֵי⁠כֶם מִשְׁלֵי־אֵ֑פֶר	1	Job is speaking as if the **maxims** that his friends have been quoting were literally made of **ashes**. Since, in this culture, garbage was burned into ashes, Job likely means that these **maxims** are worthless, at least as applied to his situation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The memorable proverbs you have been quoting are worthless to me”
13:12	brf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠גַבֵּי־חֹ֝֗מֶר גַּבֵּי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends’ **defenses** of God were literally made of **clay**. He likely means that, like clay, they are fragile and would shatter if struck. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “your defenses would crumble if anyone challenged you”
13:13	vp1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יַעֲבֹ֖ר עָלַ֣⁠י מָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if something might literally **come upon** him when he spoke. He means that something might happen to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will accept the consequences, whatever they may be”
13:14	wk5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י אָשִׂ֥ים בְּ⁠כַפִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is posing to his friends a question whose answer he already knows. He is doing this to introduce the answer. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you why I am taking my flesh in my teeth, yes, putting my life in my hands.”
13:14	j414		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally taking (that is, carrying) his own **flesh** in his **teeth**. The image seems to be that of an animal carrying in its mouth prey that it has caught and killed. Until the animal is able to bring the prey safely into its den, the prey is vulnerable and there is a risk that another animal will come and take it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Why do I put my flesh at risk”
13:14	j415		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean all of him.

13:14	j416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י אָשִׂ֥ים בְּ⁠כַפִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he is literally holding his **life** in his **hands**, where once again it would be vulnerable, as in the preceding image in this verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and jeopardize my life”
13:15	j417		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	יִ֭קְטְלֵ⁠נִי ל֣וֹ אֲיַחֵ֑ל	1	Job is using the statement form to describe a conditional relationship, that is, to say what he would do if God did a specific thing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “even if he kills me, I will still hope in him”
13:15	j418		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דְּ֝רָכַ֗⁠י	1	Job is speaking of how he has been living as if he had been walking along certain **ways** or paths. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my conduct”
13:15	j419		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶל־פָּנָ֥י⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “in his presence”
13:16	e8gk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גַּם־הוּא־לִ֥⁠י לִֽ⁠ישׁוּעָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “This is what will actually save me”
13:16	j420		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֥ף	1	Job is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a godless person”
13:16	t8zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ֝⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “into his presence”
13:17	z88n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שִׁמְע֣וּ שָׁ֭מוֹעַ	1	Job is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Make sure that you hear”
13:17	g1xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אַֽחֲוָתִ֗⁠י	1	Job is using the term **word** to mean what he is about to say to God in his own defense by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and may what I am about to say be”
13:17	ppd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אַֽחֲוָתִ֗⁠י בְּ⁠אָזְנֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is using the term **ears** by association to mean hearing or listening. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “Yes, listen carefully to my declaration”
13:18	mb7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִ֥י אֶצְדָּֽק	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **am righteous**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I am certainly righteous” or “I am certainly innocent”
13:19	u63c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִי־ה֭וּא יָרִ֣יב עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I do not believe that anyone could contend successfully with me”
13:19	t9jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to describe what would happen under the condition he has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “If someone does prove me wrong,”
13:19	b4n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “and pass away”
13:20	j421		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַךְ־שְׁ֭תַּיִם	1	At this point in his speech, Job stops addressing his three friends and starts addressing God directly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “God, only two things do not do to me”
13:20	y87x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַל־תַּ֣עַשׂ & מִ֝⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **do** are singular here because Job is starting to address God directly. He continues to speak to God for the rest of this chapter and in all of chapter 14. So use singular forms of second-person pronouns and imperatives in your translation from here to the end of chapter 14 if your language marks that distinction.
13:20	yzd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ֝⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “from you presence”
13:21	l5nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּ֭פְּ⁠ךָ מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י הַרְחַ֑ק	1	Here, **hand** represents the power of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Stop using your power to make me suffer”
13:21	w19t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אֵ֥מָתְ⁠ךָ֗	1	Job is using the term **fear** by association to mean something that causes a person to feel fear, the awesome presence of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and with your fearsome presence”
13:23	adu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כַּ⁠מָּ֣ה לִ֭⁠י עֲוֺנ֣וֹת וְ⁠חַטָּא֑וֹת פִּֽשְׁעִ֥⁠י וְ֝⁠חַטָּאתִ֗⁠י הֹדִיעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	While the terms **iniquities**, **sins**, and **transgression** mean similar things, Job is not necessarily using the three terms together for emphasis. There is a slight distinction between the kinds of activities that these terms describe, and Job may be naming these different activities as specific examples of potential wrongdoing in order to represent all types of wrongdoing. To show this, in your translation you could use three different terms that your language may have for wrongdoing. Alternatively, you could express the general meaning. Either way, you could combine the question and the imperative into a polite request. Alternate translation: “Please tell me what crimes or misdeeds or offenses I may have committed” or “Please tell me if I have done wrong in any way”
13:24	i7qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לָֽ⁠מָּה־פָנֶ֥י⁠ךָ תַסְתִּ֑יר	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the expression **hide your face** means to show disfavor or hostility to someone. Alternate translation: “Why do you treat me with hostility”
13:25	xm7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף תַּעֲר֑וֹץ וְ⁠אֶת־קַ֖שׁ יָבֵ֣שׁ תִּרְדֹּֽף	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You do not need to terrify a driven leaf! You do not need to pursue dry stubble!”
13:25	j422		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף תַּעֲר֑וֹץ וְ⁠אֶת־קַ֖שׁ יָבֵ֣שׁ תִּרְדֹּֽף	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a **driven leaf** and **dry stubble**. By comparing himself to those things, he is indicating that he is fragile and insignificant and that God does not need to oppose him powerfully. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as exclamations: “You do not need to terrify someone who is as fragile as I am! You do not need to pursue someone who is as insignificant as I am!”
13:25	j423		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Job is referring to a leaf that is **driven** by the wind. Alternate translation: “a leaf that the wind is driving” or “a leaf that the wind is blowing about”
13:26	h6dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִכְתֹּ֣ב עָלַ֣⁠י מְרֹר֑וֹת	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally writing down charges against him. In this culture, that was the way of formally filing legal charges against someone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you charge me with bitter crimes”
13:26	j424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִכְתֹּ֣ב עָלַ֣⁠י מְרֹר֑וֹת	1	Job is speaking as if the things that God is holding against him were **bitter** or bad-tasting. He means that they are things that would make someone feel unpleasant, just as bitter food or drink does. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you charge me with horrible crimes”
13:26	bc7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠תוֹרִישֵׁ֗⁠נִי עֲוֺנ֥וֹת נְעוּרָֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God is literally giving him an inheritance. He means that God is punishing him for the wrong things that he did in his **youth**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you punish me for the iniquities of my youth”
13:26	l6wx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠תוֹרִישֵׁ֗⁠נִי עֲוֺנ֥וֹת נְעוּרָֽ⁠י	1	Job is suggesting implicitly that God should not judge him strictly for things he did in his **youth**, since youths are immature and impulsive and they do wrong things without having the kind of self-control and knowledge that adults should have. The Bible expresses this same perspective in [Psalm 25:7](../psa/25/07.md). You could indicate this implication in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you judge me strictly for the immature things I did as a youth, which is not fair”
13:27	l4hx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠תָ֘שֵׂ֤ם בַּ⁠סַּ֨ד ׀ רַגְלַ֗⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God literally has put his **feet** in **shackles**. He means that God has restrained his actions severely by punishing him for the slightest infractions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you restrain my actions severely by punishing me for the slightest infractions”
13:27	v65x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠תִשְׁמ֥וֹר כָּל־אָרְחוֹתָ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his courses of action were literally **paths** that he was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you watch everything I do”
13:27	x3kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־שָׁרְשֵׁ֥י רַ֝גְלַ֗⁠י תִּתְחַקֶּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally taking some action regarding his **feet**. Interpreters are unsure of the exact meaning of this image. Job could be speaking as if: (1) God had drawn lines in the ground to mark foot-shaped areas where Job would have to step. Alternate translation: “you only allow me to step in a few small places” or “you only permit me to do a limited number of things without being punished” (2) God had put some kind of mark on his feet so that he would leave a distinctive footprint that God could easily track. Alternate translation: “you closely watch all of my actions”
13:28	mlj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ֭⁠הוּא & יִבְלֶ֑ה	1	Job is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “and I decay”
13:28	fq5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ֭⁠הוּא & יִבְלֶ֑ה	1	Job is using the word **and** to introduce the result of the sufferings he is experiencing, which he considers to be punishments from God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “so that he decays” or “so that I decay”
14:intro	t321				0	# Job 14 General Notes\n\n##Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the conclusion of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.\n- Verses 1–12: Job says that God should not pay so much attention to humans, since they have short and troubled lives.\n- Verses 13–17: Job speculates about what it would be like if God could bring him back to life and be friendly towards him again.\n- Verses 18–22: Job concludes pessimistically that he will likely just die and be separated forever from human community.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Resurrection\n\nJob lived at a time when people did not know for certain whether there would be a resurrection of the dead, so Job speculates about this in his speeches. Sometimes he is more hopeful about it, and at other times he is less hopeful about it. In your translation, reflect what he is feeling and saying. It is not necessary to adjust his words in order to make them a confident proclamation about the resurrection.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### singular and plural “you”\n\nThe words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the singular form in your translation.\n\n### “man” in a generic sense\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Job uses the word “man” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, such as “people,” “mortals,” or “humans.”
14:1	j425		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה קְצַ֥ר יָ֝מִ֗ים וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. However, Job is being deliberately terse in order to describe the human condition as pitiful, so you may wish to translate this statement with fewer words than your language would ordinarly use. Alternate translation: “Man, who is born of woman, is few of days and full of trouble”
14:1	j426		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Every child of a human mother”
14:1	j427		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	Job is using the phrase **born of woman** by association to mean that people are mortal. In other words, just as they are naturally born, they will naturally die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Mortal man”
14:1	d6in		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here and throughout the chapter the masculine term “man” has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, in all such instances you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “Mortal humans”
14:1	u162		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קְצַ֥ר יָ֝מִ֗ים וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job does not mean that in general people live for only a few **days**. He is using the term **days** to mean time in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His life is short and it is full of trouble”
14:1	pfe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job is speaking of **Man** as if he were a container that **trouble** fills. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and continually troubled”
14:2	bgr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כְּ⁠צִ֣יץ יָ֭צָא וַ⁠יִּמָּ֑ל וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח כַּ֝⁠צֵּ֗ל וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֽוֹד	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. Since Job is using two different images together, it may be helpful to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is conveying the same idea as the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “He comes forth and withers like a flower; yes, he flees like a shadow and does not stand”
14:2	w4bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח כַּ֝⁠צֵּ֗ל וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֽוֹד	1	In this context, the word **stand** means to stay in one place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he flees like a shadow; indeed, he does not remain”
14:3	tkx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אַף־עַל־זֶ֭ה פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ וְ⁠אֹ֘תִ֤⁠י תָבִ֖יא בְ⁠מִשְׁפָּ֣ט עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “And yet on such you open your eye! You bring me into judgment with you!”
14:3	inl9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַף־עַל־זֶ֭ה פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is using the phrase **open your eye** by association to mean watching. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Must you really watch such creatures”
14:3	fg87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ & תָבִ֖יא & עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the words **you** and **your** are singular here because Job is continuing to address God directly. So use the singular forms of those pronouns in your translation here and throughout this chapter if your language marks that distinction.
14:4	j428		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	For emphasis, Job is posing a question and then answering it himself. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one can bring clean from unclean!”
14:4	pls1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	Job is using the adjectives **clean** and **unclean** as nouns, probably to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Every person is unclean, so no person can bear and raise someone who is clean”
14:4	j429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	Job is speaking as if people who are sinful are literally **unclean** or dirty and as if people who are not sinful are literally **clean**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Every person is sinful, so no person can bear and raise someone who is not sinful”
14:5	jij3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֲרוּצִ֨ים ׀ יָמָ֗י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to a person in general, as in verse 2. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “a person’s days are determined”
14:5	fm5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	חֲרוּצִ֨ים ׀ יָמָ֗י⁠ו	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you have determined his days” or “you determine for how many days each person will live”
14:5	iz79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִֽסְפַּר־חֳדָשָׁ֥י⁠ו אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	The expression **is with you** describes something that the person being addressed has the power and authority to decide. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “the number of his months is up to you” or “the number of his months is something that you decide”
14:6	j430		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שְׁעֵ֣ה מֵ⁠עָלָ֣י⁠ו וְ⁠יֶחְדָּ֑ל	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “so that he may desist, look away from him”
14:6	j431		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֶחְדָּ֑ל	1	In the context of this speech by Job, the word **desist** implicitly means to stop being continually concerned that God is watching and will judge and punish the slightest infraction. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “that he may live without continually fearing your punishment”
14:6	w4rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	עַד־יִ֝רְצֶ֗ה כְּ⁠שָׂכִ֥יר יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of this comparison is that a **hireling**, that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor, has difficult work, but he knows that it is only for a short time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “until he finishes living his difficult but short life”
14:6	j432		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִ֝רְצֶ֗ה & יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a human being’s brief life as if it were literally only a **day**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he lives out his brief life”
14:7	l8i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יֵ֥שׁ לָ⁠עֵ֗ץ תִּ֫קְוָ֥ה אִֽם־יִ֭כָּרֵת וְ⁠ע֣וֹד יַחֲלִ֑יף וְ֝⁠יֹֽנַקְתּ֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א תֶחְדָּֽל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way, such as with the verb “hope.” Alternate translation: “people may hope that if a tree is cut down, it will sprout again and it will live”
14:7	ezr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִ֭כָּרֵת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone cuts it down”
14:8	cqw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠בֶ⁠עָפָ֗ר יָמ֥וּת גִּזְעֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job means implicitly that the stump of the tree he is using as an example begins to die. If the tree had died completely, it could not regenerate, as he describes in the next verse. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and its stump begins to die”
14:9	f92c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מֵ⁠רֵ֣יחַ מַ֣יִם	1	Job is speaking of the tree he is describing as if it could actually smell the **scent** of **waters**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as soon as the ground becomes moist,”
14:9	dav4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ⁠עָשָׂ֖ה קָצִ֣יר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **branch**. He actually means that the stump of the tree will send forth many branches or shoots. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and send forth many shoots”
14:9	bx2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּמוֹ־נָֽטַע	1	Job is referring implicitly to a young **plant**, which would grow rapidly. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as young plants do” or “as if it were a young plant”
14:10	j433		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠גֶ֣בֶר & אָדָ֣ם	1	In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. These masculine terms have a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “but a mortal … a human being”
14:10	j434		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יִּגְוַ֖ע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “and passes away”
14:10	wz2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אַיּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “and he is gone completely”
14:11	f32z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes at the start of the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 11–12. Within it, this sentence might say something like this: “Just as waters disappear from a lake and a river dwindles and dries up, so a man lies down and does not arise.”
14:11	dug9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יֶחֱרַ֥ב וְ⁠יָבֵֽשׁ	1	The terms **dwindles** and **dries up** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “steadily dries up”
14:12	a5nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	שָׁכַ֗ב וְֽ⁠לֹא־יָ֫ק֥וּם	1	Job is using the expression **lies down** as a mild way to refer to death, and he is using the expression **arise** to mean “come back to life.” Your language may have similar expressions that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “passes away and does not return to this life”
14:12	j435		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֣א יָקִ֑יצוּ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	Job is speaking of people who are dead as if they were asleep. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they will remain dead; they will not be brought back to life”
14:12	j436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֣א יָקִ֑יצוּ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **their** and both instances of the pronoun **they** refer to people who die. Up to this point in this speech, Job has been talking about people dying by referring to a “man.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use singular pronouns in this sentence for continuity. Alternate translation: “he will not awake, no, he will not be roused from his sleep”
14:12	h4i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and no one will rouse them from their sleep” or “and no one will rouse him from his sleep”
14:13	w12i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ֤י יִתֵּ֨ן ׀ בִּ⁠שְׁא֬וֹל תַּצְפִּנֵ֗⁠נִי תַּ֭סְתִּירֵ⁠נִי עַד־שׁ֣וּב אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ תָּ֤שִׁ֥ית לִ֖⁠י חֹ֣ק וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation (as an exclamation): “I wish that you would conceal me in Sheol, {that} you would hide me until the turning of your nose, {that} you would set a limit for me and remember me!”
14:13	j438		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־שׁ֣וּב אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is speaking as if God’s **anger** might literally **turn** and go in a different direction. Job actually means that God would stop being angry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “until you stop being angry with me”
14:13	is2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תָּ֤שִׁ֥ית לִ֖⁠י חֹ֣ק  וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that God would set a **limit** on the time that Job had to spend in Sheol before God would **remember** him (see the explanation of the term “remember” in the next note). Alternate translation: “that you would decide how long I needed to spend in Sheol before you would remember me” (2) that God would choose a particular time sometime in the future when he would **remember** Job. Alternate translation: “that you would choose a particular time when you would remember me”
14:13	km9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the expression **remember** in a particular sense. He is not suggesting that God would forget anything or that there are limits to God’s knowledge or memory. Rather, in contexts such as this, the word “remember” means to be aware that someone needs help and to help that person. (For example, [Genesis 8:1](../gen/08/01.md) says that at the height of the Great Flood, “God remembered Noah and all the living things and all the livestock that were with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.”) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and help me”
14:14	u755		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־יָמ֥וּת גֶּ֗בֶר הֲ⁠יִ֫חְיֶ֥ה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Even if a man dies, he might live again!”
14:14	he34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time of my hardship”
14:14	ws2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time when things are hard for me”
14:14	j439		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	Since Job said in [7:1](../07/01.md) that a person experiences “hardship” on earth, in this phrase he is probably referring implicitly to life on earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “For as long as I live on this earth”
14:14	a2dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲיַחֵ֑ל עַד־בּ֝֗וֹא חֲלִיפָתִֽ⁠י	1	Since Job suggests at the beginning of this verse that people could live again after they die, and since he describes his present life on earth as **hardship**, the implication seems to be that by **my change**, he means his death, which presumably would lead to a better life. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I will wait patiently to die and then live a better life” or “I will hope expectantly that after I die I will live a better life”
14:15	d3u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	תִּ֭קְרָא וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ לְֽ⁠מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ תִכְסֹֽף	1	In this verse, Job is describing what would happen under the condition he described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, to indicate this you could add a connecting word at the start of this verse. You could also use the conditional tense rather than the future tense if that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Then you would call, and I would answer you. You would desire the work of your hands”
14:15	tbe8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תִּ֭קְרָא וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	Here Job is using words that are very similar to the ones that he used in [13:22](../13/22.md) to challenge God to argue his case with him. But now he means that he and God would converse in a friendly way. To help your readers appreciate this use of language, it would be helpful to translate the terms here the same way you translated them in [13:22](../13/22.md).
14:15	j440		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and I would gladly answer you”
14:15	j3fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְֽ⁠מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of creating Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the person whom you created”
14:16	q9vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַ֭תָּה צְעָדַ֣⁠י תִּסְפּ֑וֹר לֹֽא־תִ֝שְׁמ֗וֹר עַל־חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God literally will **number** or count the **steps** he is taking. He is speaking of living as if it were walking along a path. Job alludes to what he said in [13:27](../13/27.md), that God was watching his paths and marking places where he had to step. Job could mean here: (1) that once God was no longer angry with him, God would caringly observe all that he did to ensure that he was all right, but God would no longer be looking to see whether he was doing wrong. Alternate translation: “then you would caringly observe all that I did, but you would no longer be looking to see whether I was doing wrong” (2) that God is currently restricting his activities, but once God was no longer angry with him, God would not watch him so closely. Alternate translation: “now you are restricting my activities to keep me from doing the slightest thing wrong, but then you would no longer watch me so closely”
14:16	bay1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹֽא־תִ֝שְׁמ֗וֹר עַל־חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using his **sin** to mean all of him in the act of sinning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you would not watch over me to see whether I am doing wrong”
14:17	zvn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	חָתֻ֣ם בִּ⁠צְר֣וֹר פִּשְׁעִ֑⁠י	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You would seal my transgression in a bag”
14:17	cby4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָתֻ֣ם בִּ⁠צְר֣וֹר פִּשְׁעִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **seal** his **transgression** in a **bag**. He means that God would forgive his transgression and no longer regard it, as if it were hidden from view and inaccessible. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You would completely forgive my transgression”
14:17	qe5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ֝⁠תִּטְפֹּ֗ל עַל־עֲוֺנִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **plaster over** his **iniquity**. Once again he means that God would forgive him and no longer regard his iniquity, as if it were hidden from view. Job is using the same terminology as in [13:4](../13/04.md), where he said that his friends were plastering him with a lie. There he meant that while he was righteous, his friends were making it appear that he was sinful. Here he means that God would make him appear righteous because God would have forgiven all of his sin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you would make me appear righteous”
14:18	j441		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes in the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 18–19. It might say something like this: “However, just a falling mountain crumbles and a rock moves from its place, just as waters wear down stones and its flooding washes away the dust of the earth, so you destroy the hope of man”
14:18	j442		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ֭⁠אוּלָם	1	Job is using the word translated **However** to indicate a strong contrast between the possibility of renewed life and reconciliation with God after death, which he was discussing in verses 14–17, and what seems to him to be the actual human condition, which he will describe in the rest of this chapter. In your translation, indicate this strong contrast in a way that is natural in your language.
14:18	hga3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַר־נוֹפֵ֣ל יִבּ֑וֹל	1	Job is speaking as if a mountain might literally be **falling**. He means that the mountain is becoming lower in elevation because it is eroding. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “an eroding mountain crumbles”
14:18	h2q3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠צ֗וּר יֶעְתַּ֥ק מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is not referring to a specific **rock**. He means rocks in general. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and rocks move from their places”
14:18	j443		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠צ֗וּר יֶעְתַּ֥ק מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The meaning of this phrase may be similar to the meaning of the phrases “his place will not know him again” in [7:10](../07/10.md) and “one destroys it from its place” in [8:18](../08/18.md). The emphasis may be not on the rock moving but on its no longer being in its **place**. Alternate translation: “and yes, even large rocks disappear”
14:19	nc2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 תִּשְׁטֹֽף־ סְפִיחֶ֥י⁠הָ עֲפַר־אָ֑רֶץ 	1	The pronoun **its** refers to the **earth**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the flooding of the earth washes away its dust” or “when the earth floods, that washes away its dust”
14:20	q4my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּתְקְפֵ֣⁠הוּ לָ֭⁠נֶצַח	1	Job is speaking as if each person were in a lifelong struggle with God and as if God were able to **overpower** or defeat each person throughout his life. Job likely means that people struggle to live, but God is able to enforce his decree that each person must ultimately die after living for a certain time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You make people’s bodies wear out throughout their lives”
14:20	uah1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַֽ⁠יַּהֲלֹ֑ךְ	1	Job is using the expression **goes away** to mean “dies.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he passes away”
14:20	p3dh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מְשַׁנֶּ֥ה פָ֝נָ֗י⁠ו	1	The expression **changing his face** describes a person’s face becoming wrinkled as that person ages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “making his face wrinkled”
14:20	j444		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מְשַׁנֶּ֥ה פָ֝נָ֗י⁠ו	1	Job may be using one part of the aging process, the **changing** of the **face** to become wrinkled, to mean the entire process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causing him to age”
14:20	lq7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠תְּשַׁלְּחֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Job is implicitly describing how God will **send** a person **away** from the community of living people to the abode of the dead. Job will describe this isolation in more detail in the next two verses. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you send him away from the community of living people to the abode of the dead”
14:21	m7cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָ֭נָי⁠ו	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “His children”
14:22	j445		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אַךְ־בְּ֭שָׂר⁠וֹ עָלָ֣י⁠ו יִכְאָ֑ב וְ֝⁠נַפְשׁ֗⁠וֹ עָלָ֥י⁠ו תֶּאֱבָֽל	1	Job is using parts of a person, his **flesh** and his **soul**, to mean all of a person in the act of grieving and mourning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He alone grieves for himself, yes, he alone mourns for himself”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the beginning of a question that continues into the next verse, but if you translate it as a statement or as an exclamation, it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “A wise person does not answer with knowledge of wind or fill his belly with the east wind!”
15:2	j446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הֶֽ⁠חָכָ֗ם יַעֲנֶ֥ה דַֽעַת־ר֑וּחַ וִֽ⁠ימַלֵּ֖א קָדִ֣ים בִּטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz is talking about Job in the third person, even though he is speaking to him directly. He is saying that Job himself must not be a wise person, since he has been talking in this way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “I can tell that you are not a wise person, because you have answered with knowledge of wind, yes, you have filled your belly with the east wind!”
15:2	j447		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הֶֽ⁠חָכָ֗ם יַעֲנֶ֥ה	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Will the wise person answer”
15:2	hd46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דַֽעַת־ר֑וּחַ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job’s **knowledge** consisted literally of **wind**. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. Eliphaz could mean: (1) that Job is talking a lot, making a loud sound, but not saying anything of substance, just as the wind blows loudly but is only air. Alternate translation: “with such bluster” (2) that what Job is saying is insubstantial, as if it were the air that the wind was blowing around. Alternate translation: “with such empty statements”
15:2	h768		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וִֽ⁠ימַלֵּ֖א קָדִ֣ים בִּטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job has literally filled his **belly** with the **east wind**. In this location, the wind from the east brought hot air from the desert. Eliphaz is using this image to portray Job as taking deep breaths so that he can speak at length and then breathing out hot air as he speaks. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No, a wise man would not be so full of hot air”
15:3	mka2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הוֹכֵ֣חַ בְּ֭⁠דָבָר לֹ֣א יִסְכּ֑וֹן וּ֝⁠מִלִּ֗ים לֹא־יוֹעִ֥יל בָּֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the continuation of a question that began in the previous verse, but it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “No, a wise person does not reason with a word that does not benefit or with words that do not have profit in them!”
15:3	j448		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הוֹכֵ֣חַ בְּ֭⁠דָבָר לֹ֣א יִסְכּ֑וֹן וּ֝⁠מִלִּ֗ים לֹא־יוֹעִ֥יל בָּֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is using the terms **word** and **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “reasoning by saying things that do not benefit and by making statements that do not have profit in them”
15:4	k1xg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַ֭תָּה תָּפֵ֣ר יִרְאָ֑ה	1	For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **destroy**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “you are completely destroying fear”

15:22	lh1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חָֽרֶב	1	Eliphaz is using one kind of deadly weapon, the **sword**, by association to mean violent death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “violent death”
15:23	j480		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	 נֹ֘דֵ֤ד ה֣וּא לַ⁠לֶּ֣חֶם אַיֵּ֑ה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “He is wandering for bread, asking where it is” or “He is wandering for bread, wondering where he will find it”
15:23	k4qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לַ⁠לֶּ֣חֶם	1	Eliphaz is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for food”
15:23	ul3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יֽוֹם־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Eliphaz is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a time of darkness”
15:23	j481		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֽוֹם־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if this wicked person knows that a time is coming when there will literally be **darkness** during the day. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a time of great trouble”
15:23	j482		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נָכ֖וֹן בְּ⁠יָד֣⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that God has prepared for him is at hand”
15:23	gu8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נָכ֖וֹן בְּ⁠יָד֣⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz is using the expression **at hand** to mean “nearby,” and he means near in time rather than near in place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is prepared and just about to happen”
15:24	e7mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְֽ֭בַעֲתֻ⁠הוּ צַ֣ר וּ⁠מְצוּקָ֑ה	1	Eliphaz is speaking of **Distress** and **anguish** as if they were living things that could **terrify** a wicked person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels distress and anguish”
15:24	vur7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יְֽ֭בַעֲתֻ⁠הוּ צַ֣ר וּ⁠מְצוּקָ֑ה	1	The terms **Distress** and **anguish** mean similar things. Eliphaz is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Great distress terrifies him” or “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels great distress”
15:24	tg34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תִּ֝תְקְפֵ֗⁠הוּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to **Distress and anguish**. Eliphaz is speaking of these two similar things as if they were one thing. Your language may permit you to do that in your translation. Alternatively, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “they overpower him”
15:25	uuk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נָטָ֣ה אֶל־אֵ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ	1	When Eliphaz says that the wicked person has **stretched out his hand**, he means specifically that he has **stretched out** a **hand** that is holding a sword or some other weapon. In other words, this expression means to fight against someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he has fought against God”
15:26	sx7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָר֣וּץ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠צַוָּ֑אר בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if a wicked person would literally attack God in this way. He is actually making a comparison to describe the arrogant confidence with which a wicked person defies God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison rather than as a literal statement. Alternate translation: “He opposes God as if he were a warrior arrogantly attacking God, confident that his thick shield would protect him”
15:26	j483		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָר֣וּץ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **He** refers to the wicked person, while the pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The wicked person rushes against God”
15:26	j484		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠צַוָּ֑אר	1	This expression refers to the attitude of someone who is holding his neck straight and his head high, displaying arrogant confidence with his posture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “arrogantly”
15:26	b87u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	The word “boss” describes the outwardly rounded part of a shield. A warrior would face this part of the shield against an enemy, holding the shield by a handle inside the boss. If a shield had a thick boss, that would protect the warrior against blows from swords and spears, and it would also allow a warrior to use the shield to knock an opponent down and pin him to the ground. If your readers would not be familiar with what **bosses** of **shields** are, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “confident that he can use his thick shield to protect himself and attack his opponent”
15:26	db71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י	1	Eliphaz speaks in this verse of the **thickness* of the shield that the wicked person would use against God, but in the next verse he indicates that the wicked person is actually “fat” and so not in shape physically for combat. So while Eliphaz seems to suggest here that the wicked person is a formidable foe, he actually means the opposite of what he is saying, as the next verse reveals. To help your readers recognize this, if your language has a word that can mean both “thick” and “fat,” it would be appropriate to use that word here in your translation.
15:26	j485		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	By using the plural forms **bosses** and **shields**, Eliphaz seems to be portraying the wicked person as if he were an army or as if he were commanding an army. It may be more natural in your language to use singular forms. Alternate translation: “the boss of his shield”
15:27	uc39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כִּֽי־כִסָּ֣ה פָנָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠חֶלְבּ֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ פִּימָ֣ה עֲלֵי־כָֽסֶל	1	Eliphaz is using two parts of the wicked person, his **face** and his **flanks**, to indicate that his whole body is obese. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “though he is very fat”
15:27	j486		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־כִסָּ֣ה פָנָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠חֶלְבּ֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ פִּימָ֣ה עֲלֵי־כָֽסֶל	1	The implication is that the wicked person has a **face** that is **fat** and **flanks** that have **blubber** because he overeats and lives indolently. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “he is very fat because he eats too much and lives a lazy life”
15:28	ki37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּשְׁכּ֤וֹן	1	Eliphaz is using the word **And** to describe what happens to the wicked after he unsuccessfully opposes God. In the previous verse, Eliphaz was describing the former prosperity of the wicked person. In this verse, he is describing what happens to the wicked person after he loses his prosperity. The implication may be that the wicked person needs to live in abandoned places not only because he is poor but also because he is an outcast, that is, because others have rejected him. Alternate translation: “Then he becomes poor and outcast, and so”
15:29	r891		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־יָק֣וּם חֵיל֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the term **stand** in [14:2](../14/02.md). Alternate translation: “and his wealth will not remain”

15:29	j487		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִנְלָֽ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **their** refers to wicked people. Since Eliphaz speaks of a wicked person in the singular in the first part of this verse, it may be more natural in your language to use the singular here as well. Alternate translation: “his possessions”
15:30	jpq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹֽא־יָס֨וּר ׀ מִנִּי־חֹ֗שֶׁךְ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [15:22](../15/22.md). Alternate translation: “His troubles will never end”
15:30	pm4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֹֽ֭נַקְתּ⁠וֹ תְּיַבֵּ֣שׁ שַׁלְהָ֑בֶת	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if the wicked person were literally a plant or bush whose **stalks** a **flame** could **dry up** or burn up. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will certainly perish”
15:30	a9ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠יָס֗וּר בְּ⁠ר֣וּחַ פִּֽי⁠ו	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if a hot wind that dried up plants were actually **breath** from God’s **mouth**. (The same image appears elsewhere in the Bible, for example, in [Isaiah 40:7](../isa/40/07.md), “The grass withers, the flower wilts, for the breath of Yahweh blows on it.”) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, God will destroy him”
15:30	j489		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	פִּֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God’s mouth”
15:30	rxv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠יָס֗וּר	1	Eliphaz is using the word **depart** to mean “die.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “and he will pass away” or “and he will die”
15:31	lr37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַל־יַאֲמֵ֣ן ב⁠שו & נִתְעָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **emptiness** and **recompense**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “Let him not trust in things that have no value… for in return he will receive things that have no value”
15:32	j490		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּֽ⁠לֹא־י֭וֹמ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **his day**, he means the day for the wicked to die. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “When it is not his day to die” or “Before the time would have come for him to die”
15:32	j491		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּמָּלֵ֑א	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “this will happen”
15:32	s26k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠כִפָּת֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רַעֲנָֽנָה	1	Eliphaz is continuing the image from the previous verse of the wicked person being like a plant or bush. He is speaking of this plant or bush being alive by association with the way that its branches would be **green** inside if it were alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he will die”
15:33	beb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יַחְמֹ֣ס כַּ⁠גֶּ֣פֶן בִּסְר֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠יַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ כַּ֝⁠זַּ֗יִת נִצָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of these comparisons is that the wicked person will not be able to succeed in his endeavors. They will all end in failure, just as a **grapevine** may not be able to nourish its grapes and so they will fall off while they are still **unripe**, and just as an **olive tree** might lose its **blossoms** due to cold weather in the spring and not bear any fruit that year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “His endeavors will fail, as if he were a grapevine that lost its grapes because it could not nourish them or an olive tree that bore no fruit because it shed its blossoms due to cold weather in the spring”
15:33	g676		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יַחְמֹ֣ס כַּ⁠גֶּ֣פֶן בִּסְר֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠יַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ כַּ֝⁠זַּ֗יִת נִצָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz speaks as if the grapevine itself would **shake off** its grapes and as if the olive tree itself would **cast off** its blossoms. He means that the grapes will drop from the vine and the blossoms will fall off the tree. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will be like a grapevine whose grapes drop off and an olive tree whose blossoms fall off”
15:34	rr5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֣ף	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “godless people”
15:34	j492		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּלְמ֑וּד	1	This could mean: (1) that godless people literally will have no children or that they will have no children who survive them. Alternate translation: “will have no children who survive them” (2) that godless people will produce nothing of enduring value, as if they had no descendants. Alternate translation: “will produce nothing of enduring value”
15:34	v3q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if **fire** would literally devour or eat up these **tents**.

He means that they will be destroyed by one means or another. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the tents of people who engage in bribery will be destroyed”
15:34	j494		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is using one possession of wicked people, the **tents** in which they live, to mean all of their possessions and their standing in the community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression in [8:22](../08/22.md). Alternate translation: “and those who practice bribery will be without status or means”
15:35	u7sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָרֹ֣ה עָ֭מָל וְ⁠יָ֣לֹד אָ֑וֶן וּ֝⁠בִטְנָ֗⁠ם תָּכִ֥ין מִרְמָֽה	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if wicked people were literally women who had **trouble**, **iniquity**, and **deceit** as their children. He means that wicked people produce these things in their lives. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They think of bad things to do and they do wicked things, yes, they intentionally deceive others”
16:intro	j3zc				0	# Job 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s second speech. In verses 1–6, Job complains that his friends have not helped him with their advice. In verses 7–22, Job describes how he feels God has made him suffer. Job briefly addresses God directly in verses 7 and 8.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “witness,” “advocate,” and “intercessor”\n\nIn verses 19–21, Job describes the need for someone to plead his case to God in heaven. This is likely the same figure whom Job calls his “redeemer” in [19:25](../19/25.md). Although Job does not seem to be giving a prophecy knowingly about the Messiah, the role that he describes closely parallels the way that Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. He says that such a person would testify that he had not done wrong (be his “witness”), take his side (be his “advocate”), and plead with God not to punish him (be his “intercessor”). In your translation, use words that describe someone in your culture who does these things for another person. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/intercede]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nVariation between singular and plural “you”\n\nIn verses 1–8, Job sometimes uses the singular form of “you” to address either Eliphaz or God and he sometimes uses the plural form of “you” to address all three of his friends together. Notes identify which form he is using in each instance so that you can use the appropriate form in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you.”
16:2	j497		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	כֻּלְּ⁠כֶֽם	1	As the context suggests, the word **you** is plural here because Job is using it to refer to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:2	t7wj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מְנַחֲמֵ֖י עָמָ֣ל	1	Job is not using this possessive form to say that his friends are providing comfort to **trouble**. He is using the form to say that in their attempts to be his **comforters**, they are causing him further trouble. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “troublesome counselors”
16:3	p7ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠קֵ֥ץ לְ⁠דִבְרֵי־ר֑וּחַ א֥וֹ מַה־יַּ֝מְרִֽיצְ⁠ךָ֗ כִּ֣י תַעֲנֶֽה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “I wish that you would stop speaking these words of wind! I do not think anything compels you to answer.”
16:3	g4tp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠דִבְרֵי־ר֑וּחַ	1	Job is answering Eliphaz with his own words. See how you translated the similar expression in [15:2](../15/02.md). Alternate translation: “to insubstantial words” or “to such bluster”
16:3	j498		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תַעֲנֶֽה	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is using it to refer only to Eliphaz, who has just spoken to him. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:4	j499		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ל֤וּ־יֵ֪שׁ נַפְשְׁ⁠כֶ֡ם תַּ֤חַת נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself and his friends, their **souls**, to mean all of them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if you were in my place”
16:4	j500		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	כָּ⁠כֶ֪ם & נַפְשְׁ⁠כֶ֡ם & עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֣ם & עֲ֝לֵי⁠כֶ֗ם	1	The word **you** is plural in each of these instances because Job is using it to refer to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:4	mg21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַחְבִּ֣ירָה& בְּ⁠מִלִּ֑ים	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean the things that he would say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I would say one thing after another”
16:4	bv7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠אָנִ֥יעָה עֲ֝לֵי⁠כֶ֗ם בְּמ֣וֹ רֹאשִֽׁ⁠י	1	To **shake** the **head** at someone is a symbolic action indicating disapproval. This action may have the same meaning in your culture. If not, your culture may have a comparable gesture that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and I would point my finger at you”
16:5	j501		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אֲאַמִּצְ⁠כֶ֥ם בְּמוֹ־פִ֑⁠י וְ⁠נִ֖יד שְׂפָתַ֣⁠י יַחְשֹֽׂךְ	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. He does not feel that his friends actually have been strengthening him or relieving him. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means for emphasis, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “I would say things such as you have been saying, thinking that I was strengthening and comforting you, even though saying such things would actually make you feel worse, as you have been making me feel worse”
16:5	i21i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֲאַמִּצְ⁠כֶ֥ם	1	The word **you** is plural here because Job is using it to refer to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:5	dvh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּמוֹ־פִ֑⁠י וְ⁠נִ֖יד שְׂפָתַ֣⁠י	1	Job is using the terms **mouth** and **lips** by association to mean speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by what I said, and the things that I spoke”
16:6	vjz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לֹא־יֵחָשֵׂ֣ךְ כְּאֵבִ֑⁠י	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that does not relieve my pain”
16:6	s8sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־מִ⁠נִּ֥י יַהֲלֹֽךְ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “that does not make the pain go away”
16:7	t7qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֶלְאָ֑⁠נִי	1	The pronoun **he** most likely refers to God, since the following pronoun **you** seems clearly to address God. Job seems to be referring to God in the third person in order to make a transition from speaking to his friends, and he then seems to be addressing God directly in the second person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you, God, have exhausted me”
16:7	mrz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	הֲ֝שִׁמּ֗וֹתָ	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is using it to refer to God. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:8	pz4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	 וַֽ֭⁠תִּקְמְטֵ⁠נִי לְ⁠עֵ֣ד הָיָ֑ה וַ⁠יָּ֥קָם בִּ֥⁠י כַ֝חֲשִׁ֗⁠י בְּ⁠פָנַ֥⁠י יַעֲנֶֽה	1	Job is speaking as if his **shriveled** condition, his **leanness**, were a living thing that was serving as a **witness** and testifying against him. He means that people consider him to be guilty of sin because they believe that God is punishing him with a sickness that has made him lose weight. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and because you have afflicted me with a sickness that has made me emaciated, people consider that to be evidence that I have sinned”
16:8	z1f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וַֽ֭⁠תִּקְמְטֵ⁠נִי	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is using it to refer to God. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:8	wiw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠פָנַ֥⁠י	1	Here the word **face** could mean: (1) Job himself, using one part of him to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “against me” (2) Job’s reputation as a righteous person, in a specific sense of the word **face**. Alternate translation: “against my good reputation”
16:9	a6fe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	טָרַ֨ף ׀ וַֽ⁠יִּשְׂטְמֵ֗⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally a wild animal that had **attacked** and **torn** him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as a comparison. Alternate translation: “he has been like a wild animal, tearing and attacking me”
16:9	crc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	טָרַ֨ף ׀ וַֽ⁠יִּשְׂטְמֵ֗⁠נִי	1	Since a wild animal would attack its prey before tearing it, it might be more natural to reverse the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “he has attacked me and he has torn me”
16:9	j503		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	חָרַ֣ק עָלַ֣⁠י בְּ⁠שִׁנָּ֑י⁠ו	1	This action expresses strong anger. If there is a similar gesture in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also indicate the meaning of this gesture. Alternate translation: “he is so angry at me that he grinds his teeth together”
16:9	c555		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִלְט֖וֹשׁ עֵינָ֣י⁠ו לִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God, whom he believes is acting towards him as an **enemy**, were literally sharpening his **eyes**, the way one would sharpen a sword in order to use it dangerously as a weapon. Job means that God is focusing his eyes intently on him to recognize ways to attack him further and to ensure that he, Job, does not escape. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “focuses his eyes intently on me”
16:10	i21w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	פָּעֲר֬וּ עָלַ֨⁠י ׀ בְּ⁠פִי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	Opening the mouth wide at someone was a symbolic action that expressed ridicule. If there is a similar gesture in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also indicate the meaning of this gesture. Alternate translation: “They open their mouths wide at me in order to ridicule me”
16:10	j504		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בְּ⁠פִי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	Since Job is speaking of many people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “with their mouths”
16:11	mm84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יְדֵ֖י	1	Here, **hands** represents the power and control that people have over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the power of”
16:11	j505		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
16:11	zm7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִרְטֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally throwing him **into the hands of the wicked**. He means that God is abandoning him to whatever it is that wicked people would want to do to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he abandons me”
16:12	t8kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יְפַרְפְּרֵ֗⁠נִי וְ⁠אָחַ֣ז בְּ֭⁠עָרְפִּ⁠י וַֽ⁠יְפַצְפְּצֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God has literally **shattered** him, breaking him into many parts, and **seized** his neck and **shaken** him **to pieces**. He means that God has destroyed everything important in his life—his family, his health, and his possessions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison, as the UST does, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he has destroyed my family, my health, and my possessions”
16:12	nt7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יְקִימֵ֥⁠נִי ל֝֗⁠וֹ לְ⁠מַטָּרָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God has literally **set** him **up as a target**. (He continues this image in the first line of the next verse.) He means that it seems as if God has harmed him very intentionally. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison, as the UST does, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, it seems as if he has harmed me very intentionally”
16:13	kx4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָ֘סֹ֤בּוּ עָלַ֨⁠י ׀ רַבָּ֗י⁠ו	1	Job is speaking as if **archers** whom God commands have literally **surrounded** him. He means that God has caused him to experience many different troubles. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, as long as you also used plain language in the last sentence of the previous verse. Alternate translation: “he has caused me to experience many troubles”
16:13	j507		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְפַלַּ֣ח כִּ֭לְיוֹתַ⁠י וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל יִשְׁפֹּ֥ךְ לָ֝⁠אָ֗רֶץ מְרֵרָֽתִ⁠י	1	Job means implicitly that these archers are seeking mercilessly to kill him by shooting their arrows into his vital organs. (By saying that God **pours** his **bile** on the **ground**, Job means that God’s archers have pierced his liver as well as his **kidneys**, since the liver produces bile and that fluid would spill out of the body if the liver were pierced.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “They are seeking mercilessly to kill me by shooting their arrows into my vital organs”
16:13	e7bp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְפַלַּ֣ח כִּ֭לְיוֹתַ⁠י וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל יִשְׁפֹּ֥ךְ לָ֝⁠אָ֗רֶץ מְרֵרָֽתִ⁠י	1	Job does not mean that arrows have literally pierced his **kidneys** and liver. He is continuing the image of the archers to indicate that it feels to him as if God is mercilessly trying to kill him in a way that he could not possibly survive. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It feels to me as if God is mercilessly trying to kill me in a way that I could not possibly survive”
16:13	j506		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְפַלַּ֣ח & וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל & יִשְׁפֹּ֥ךְ	1	The pronouns **He** and **he** refer to God. Job means that God is doing these things through the symbolic **archers** that he describes in the previous sentence. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use plural pronouns to show that this is a continuation of the image of the archers. Alternate translation: “They pierce my kidneys and do not spare; they pour my bile on the ground”
16:14	lx7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִפְרְצֵ֣⁠נִי פֶ֭רֶץ עַל־פְּנֵי־פָ֑רֶץ	1	Job is speaking as if he were a defensive wall around a city and God was smashing openings or breaches in that wall. He means that the continual sufferings that he is experiencing are making him less and less able to be resilient. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He causes me continual sufferings that are making me less and less resilient”
16:14	j508		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פֶ֭רֶץ עַל־פְּנֵי־פָ֑רֶץ	1	This expression could mean: (1) that God is smashing openings in many different places in this wall (which represents Job). Alternate translation, if you choose to represent the image in your translation: “smashing openings in many different places in my wall” (2) that after succeeding in smashing an opening in this wall, God smashes repeatedly in the same place to make that opening bigger. Alternate translation: “ever enlarging the opening in my wall”
16:14	r9md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָרֻ֖ץ עָלַ֣⁠י כְּ⁠גִבּֽוֹר	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally running against him the way a **warrior** would run to attack an enemy soldier. Job is answering Eliphaz with his own words. In [15:26](../15/26.md), Eliphaz used the same image to describe how wicked people oppose God. If you used the image or represented it as a comparison in your translation in that verse, you may wish to translate the corresponding image here in the same way. If you used plain language there, you could use similar language here. Alternate translation: “he opposes me very forcefully”
16:15	cnt2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שַׂ֣ק תָּ֭פַרְתִּי עֲלֵ֣י גִלְדִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he had literally **sewn** sackcloth onto his **skin**. He could mean: (1) that he is continually in mourning, as if he wore sackcloth (a sign of mourning) so frequently that it seemed to be **sewn** onto his skin. Alternate translation: “I am continually in mourning” (2) that he actually has been wearing sackcloth (although the narrative at the beginning of the book does not say so) and it has stuck to his skin because of his boils, as if it were sewn to his skin. Alternate translation: “The sackcloth I have been wearing in grief has stuck to my skin”
16:15	hil8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עֹלַ֖לְתִּי בֶ⁠עָפָ֣ר קַרְנִֽ⁠י	1	People in the biblical culture used the **horn** of an animal to represent strength and honor. When they did, they would speak of humans as if they had horns like animals. For example, [Psalm 112:9](../psa/112/09.md) says of the person who fears Yahweh, “His horn rises high in honor.” Job is using the image in the opposite way to say that he is suffering disgrace. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I am suffering great disgrace”
16:16	l1id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עַ֖ל עַפְעַפַּ֣⁠י צַלְמָֽוֶת	1	Job is describing the fact that he has not been sleeping well, by association with the way that dark circles form around the eyes of someone who lacks sleep. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and I have dark circles around my eyes from lack of sleep”
16:17	cs74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹא־חָמָ֣ס בְּ⁠כַפָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the potential act of committing **violence**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have not committed any violence”
16:17	j509		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זַכָּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if his prayer were literally **pure**, that is, as if it were a physical substance that had nothing else mixed in. He means that when he prays, he means just what he says and he has no other motives other than sincerely speaking with God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is sincere”
16:18	xf2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	אֶ֭רֶץ אַל־תְּכַסִּ֣י דָמִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking to something that he knows cannot hear him, the **Earth**. He is doing that to show in a strong way how he feels about what has been happening to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I hope that when I die, my blood will remain visible on the earth”
16:18	aj18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶ֭רֶץ אַל־תְּכַסִּ֣י דָמִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally going to be murdered and as if his **blood** were going to fall to the ground and soak into the earth unless something prevented that. He means that he is like the victim of a deadly crime in that he deserves justice but there is a risk that he will not receive it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I want to receive justice for what is happening to me”
16:18	bg2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	וְֽ⁠אַל־יְהִ֥י מָ֝ק֗וֹם לְ⁠זַעֲקָתִֽ⁠י	1	It is likely that Job is continuing to address the **Earth** in this part of the verse. Once again he is doing that in order to show in a strong way how he feels about what has been happening to him. Job is speaking as if the earth could hear him and as if it could make sure that none of its locations would provide a **place** for anyone to hide Job’s **cry** so that it was not answered. The context makes clear that this is a cry for justice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly Alternate translation: “and I hope that my cry for justice is answered and not hidden”
16:19	z7js		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַ⁠שָּׁמַ֣יִם עֵדִ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠שָׂהֲדִ֗⁠י בַּ⁠מְּרוֹמִֽים	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter to decide how to translate the terms **witness** and **advocate**, which both describe the same person, someone whom Job expects will intercede for him in heaven. Alternate translation: “the person who has taken my side is pleading my case to God in heaven”
16:19	ietk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בַּ⁠מְּרוֹמִֽים	1	Job is using the term **heights** to mean heaven, which is high above the earth. The plural form probably identifies these **heights** as the supreme example of their class. That is, while being on top of a mountain gives someone a commanding position, ruling from heaven gives God the supremely commanding position. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is in highest heaven” or “is in heaven, where he rules supremely”
16:20	b5wz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	מְלִיצַ֥⁠י רֵעָ֑⁠י	1	This could mean: (1) that Job has a single individual in mind here, the one he called his “witness” and “advocate” in the previous verse. While the terms **intercessors** and **friends** are plural, it seems Job could be using plural forms to indicate an indefinite individual. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “There is a certain intercessor who is my friend” (2) that Job is saying that by contrast with the way this “witness” and “advocate” will take his side, his friends have been scoffing at him. The word translated **intercessors** can also mean “scoffers” (although Job uses it again in [33:23](../33/23.md) to mean “intercessor”). Alternate translation: “My friends are scoffing at me”
16:20	v43g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֶל־אֱ֝ל֗וֹהַ דָּלְפָ֥ה עֵינִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of weeping. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am pleading tearfully to God for mercy”
16:21	izh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לְ⁠גֶ֣בֶר	1	When he refers to a **man** in the first part of this verse, Job seems to be speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “for me”
16:21	kk12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּֽ⁠בֶן־אָדָ֥ם לְ⁠רֵעֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and a son of man argues for his neighbor”
16:21	j510		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וּֽ⁠בֶן־אָדָ֥ם לְ⁠רֵעֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to say that the phrase it introduces is just as true as the previous phrase. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “just as a son of man argues for his neighbor”
16:21	j511		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וּֽ⁠בֶן־אָדָ֥ם לְ⁠רֵעֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Although the terms **son** and **man** are masculine, the phrase **a son of man** has a generic sense and means “a human being.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “just as one human being argues on behalf of another human being”
16:22	j512		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שְׁנ֣וֹת מִסְפָּ֣ר יֶאֱתָ֑יוּ	1	Job is using the expression **years of number** to mean “a few years.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a few years will go by”
16:22	z81v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠אֹ֖רַח לֹא־אָשׁ֣וּב אֶהֱלֹֽךְ	1	When Job says that he will **go** on a **path** and **not return**, he means that he will die. This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “and I will pass away” or “and then I will die”
17:intro	rs6g				0	# Job 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the conclusion of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s second speech. Job expresses his disappointment with his friends’ advice, he asks Yahweh to help him, and he wishes that he had good things to hope for.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.
17:1	j513		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	רוּחִ֣⁠י חֻ֭בָּלָה יָמַ֥⁠י נִזְעָ֗כוּ	1	Job is making an overstatement when he says that his **spirit** has already been **destroyed** and his **days** have already been **extinguished**. He means that this is nearly the case. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My spirit is nearly destroyed, my days are nearly extinguished”
17:1	j514		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	רוּחִ֣⁠י חֻ֭בָּלָה יָמַ֥⁠י נִזְעָ֗כוּ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “My troubles have nearly destroyed my spirit and extinguished my days”
17:1	c8r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	רוּחִ֣⁠י	1	This could mean: (1) Job’s life. Job would be using one part of himself, his **spirit**, to mean all of him. Alternate translation: “My life” (2) Job’s strength and morale. Alternate translation: “My strength” or “My morale”
17:1	yjx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָמַ֥⁠י נִזְעָ֗כוּ	1	Job is using the term **days** to mean a specific period of time, his lifetime. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life is extinguished”
17:1	j515		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָמַ֥⁠י נִזְעָ֗כוּ	1	Job is speaking as if his life were literally a flame that something had **extinguished** or snuffed out. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life is almost over”
17:1	j516		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	קְבָרִ֥ים לִֽ⁠י	1	While the term **graves** is plural, it seems unlikely that Job means he will be buried in more than one grave. (1) Job could be using the plural form to indicate an indefinite thing. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “there is a grave ready for me somewhere” (2) Job could be speaking of a graveyard or cemetery by association with the way that such a place contains many **graves**. Alternate translation: “the graveyard is ready for me”
17:1	awv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	קְבָרִ֥ים לִֽ⁠י	1	Job is saying that **graves** are ready for him to mean that he will die soon. This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “soon I will die”
17:2	jf81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־לֹ֣א הֲ֭תֻלִים עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “There are mockers with me, are there not?”
17:2	z26q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־לֹ֣א הֲ֭תֻלִים עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Surely there are mockers with me!”
17:2	j517		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אִם־לֹ֣א הֲ֭תֻלִים עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	By **mockers**, Job most likely means his friends. He would be speaking of them in the third person even though they are present. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “All three of you have been mocking me!”
17:2	wp1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וּ֝⁠בְ⁠הַמְּרוֹתָ֗⁠ם תָּלַ֥ן עֵינִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, using the second person: “Yes, all I can see is your provocations”
17:2	wr6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠בְ⁠הַמְּרוֹתָ֗⁠ם תָּלַ֥ן עֵינִֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **provocations**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Yes, all I can see is you provoking me”
17:2	j518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠בְ⁠הַמְּרוֹתָ֗⁠ם תָּלַ֥ן עֵינִֽ⁠י	1	The implication is that Job’s friends have only been provoking him, not comforting him, because otherwise he would be able to recognize their comfort. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You have only been provoking me, not comforting me”
17:3	j519		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שִֽׂימָ⁠ה־נָּ֭א עָרְבֵ֣⁠נִי עִמָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	The word **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative **set** and in the imperative **be surety for** are singular because they refer to God. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
17:3	fwk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שִֽׂימָ⁠ה־נָּ֭א עָרְבֵ֣⁠נִי עִמָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **set down**, that is, surrender to a court, something of value in order to guarantee Job’s appearance in court and good conduct. Job is similarly speaking as if God would literally **be surety** for him, that is, personally guarantee his appearance and conduct. Job speaks this way even though he says at the same time that God himself would be trying his case (that is the meaning of **with you**). Your culture may have a similar custom that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “Please put up a bond for me even as you try my case”
17:3	l8dv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי ה֝֗וּא לְ⁠יָדִ֥⁠י יִתָּקֵֽעַ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one else will strike himself to my hand”
17:3	j520		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מִֽי ה֝֗וּא לְ⁠יָדִ֥⁠י יִתָּקֵֽעַ	1	Job is speaking of one person striking his hand against a second person’s hand as a symbolic action in order to show that he was committing himself to serve as a guarantor for that second person. Your culture may have a similar practice that you could use in your translation, and you can also explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “No one else will shake hands with me to pledge that he will be my guarantor”
17:4	j521		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said in the previous verse that he believed no one else would be a guarantor for him. Alternate translation: “My friends will not be my guarantors because”
17:4	fbr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ֭בָּ⁠ם צָפַ֣נְתָּ מִּ⁠שָּׂ֑כֶל	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **hidden** the **hearts** of his friends in a place where their hearts would not come in contact with **understanding**. Within the context of this image, Job is using the heart to represent the mind. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you have kept their minds from understanding”
17:4	wj87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֣א תְרֹמֵֽם	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **exalt** his friends or lift them up to a height. He means that God would honor them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will not honor them”
17:4	y4ne		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֣א תְרֹמֵֽם	1	Job means implicitly that since God has kept his friends from understanding that he is innocent, God will not **exalt** or honor his friends by giving a guilty verdict against him, thereby vindicating what the friends have been saying. That would be allowing error to triumph. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you will not vindicate what they have been erroneously saying by giving a guilty verdict against me”
17:5	kb8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְ֭⁠חֵלֶק יַגִּ֣יד רֵעִ֑ים וְ⁠עֵינֵ֖י בָנָ֣י⁠ו תִּכְלֶֽנָה	1	Job is using one thing that God does to maintain justice, punish those who commit perjury for a bribe, to represent all that God does to maintain justice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “After all, you maintain justice by punishing people who corrupt court proceedings”
17:5	i5ps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֖י בָנָ֣י⁠ו תִּכְלֶֽנָה	1	Job is speaking of how the **eyes** of people who are dying **fail** (no longer see) in order to describe those people dying. This is a poetic way of speaking about death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “his sons will certainly die”
17:5	j522		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָנָ֣י⁠ו	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that includes both sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “his children”
17:6	j523		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְֽ֭⁠הִצִּגַ⁠נִי	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God. After briefly speaking directly to God in verses 3 and 4, Job now speaks of God once again in the third person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “But God has made me”
17:6	kzr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ⁠מְשֹׁ֣ל עַמִּ֑ים	1	Job is using the word **saying** to mean that the **peoples** are citing him by name as an outstanding example of someone who seemed to be prospering because he was righteous but who came to ruin because he was actually wicked. Your language may have an expression for this practice of citing people by name as examples that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “a byword for the peoples”
17:6	me7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠תֹ֖פֶת לְ⁠פָנִ֣ים אֶֽהְיֶֽה	1	People were **spitting** in Job’s **face** as a symbolic action to show their contempt for him as a wicked person, which he appeared to them to be.

17:7	my86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠צֵּ֣ל	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **shadow** is insubstantial, so Job’s **members**, that is, the parts of his body, have become very thin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “have become as thin as a shadow”
17:8	g1f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	יְשָׁרִ֣ים & וְ֝⁠נָקִ֗י & חָנֵ֥ף	1	Job is using the adjectives **upright**, **innocent**, and **godless** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Upright people … and innocent people … godless people”

When Job says that the **righteous** will **hold** his way, he means that that person will continue to walk along that path. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And … will continue to live as God desires”

17:9	lx6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יֹסִ֥יף אֹֽמֶץ	1	When Job says that innocent people **will add strength**, he means by this expression that they will continually grow stronger. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will grow stronger and stronger”
17:10	e43i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	כֻּלָּ֣⁠ם	1	Job is speaking about his friends in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “all of you”
17:10	e7nv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	תָּ֭שֻׁבוּ וּ⁠בֹ֣אוּ	1	This phrase may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **return** tells in what way Job wants his friends to **come**. He wants them to try speaking with him “again.” If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “come again”
17:10	j525		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָ⁠כֶ֣ם חָכָֽם	1	Job is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person.

17:11	nba8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָמַ֣⁠י עָ֭בְרוּ	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, his lifetime. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My life is almost over”
17:11	j526		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	זִמֹּתַ֣⁠י נִתְּק֑וּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I will not be able to fulfill my plans”
17:11	f9nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מ֖וֹרָשֵׁ֣י לְבָבִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking of his **heart** as if it were a living thing that could have **desires**.

17:12	m4j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָשִׂ֑ימוּ	1	The pronoun **They** refers to Job’s friends. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “My friends change”
17:12	j527		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יָשִׂ֑ימוּ	1	Job is speaking about his friends in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “You, my friends, change” or “You change”
17:12	j528		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	א֝֗וֹר קָר֥וֹב מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Many interpreters believe that in this sentence, Job is summarizing what his friends have been telling him. You may wish to represent the sentence in your translation as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “You say, ‘Light is near from the face of darkness’”
17:12	fif1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	א֝֗וֹר קָר֥וֹב מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of something, by association with the way that people can see the face of a person who is present. Alternate translation: “Light is near from the presence of darkness”
17:12	j529		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	א֝֗וֹר קָר֥וֹב מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Job may be using a proverb, a short, popular saying about something that is generally true in life, to summarize what his friends have been telling him. Or his friends may have been quoting this proverb themselves in their advice to Job. Your language may have a similar saying that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “It’s always darkest before the dawn”

17:14	j531		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לַ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת קָ֭רָאתִי אָ֣בִ⁠י אָ֑תָּה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “if I tell the pit that it is my father” or “if I call the pit my father”
17:14	uwb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת קָ֭רָאתִי אָ֣בִ⁠י אָ֑תָּה	1	If Job said this, he would be saying that **the pit** was his home, by association with the way that a person lives in the home of his **father**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I call to the pit, ‘You {are} my home’”
17:14	j532		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	לַ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת קָ֭רָאתִי אָ֣בִ⁠י אָ֑תָּה	1	If Job did speak this way to **the pit**, that is, to the realm of the dead, he would be speaking to something that he knew could not hear and understand him in order to make an emphatic statement. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I said that the pit was certainly going to be my home”
17:14	j533		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִמִּ֥⁠י וַ֝⁠אֲחֹתִ֗⁠י לָֽ⁠רִמָּֽה	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “or if I call to the worm and say, ‘You are my mother,’ or, ‘You are my sister’”
17:14	e6lb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אִמִּ֥⁠י וַ֝⁠אֲחֹתִ֗⁠י לָֽ⁠רִמָּֽה	1	If Job said this to a **worm**, such as would be found in a grave, he would be saying that the grave was going to be his home, by association with the way that a person shares a home with his **mother** and **sister**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or if I call to the worm, ‘I am going to share the grave with you’” or “or if I call to the worm, ‘I am going to be in a grave, just as you are’”
17:14	j534		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	אִמִּ֥⁠י וַ֝⁠אֲחֹתִ֗⁠י לָֽ⁠רִמָּֽה	1	If Job did speak this way to a **worm**, he would be speaking to something that he knew could not hear and understand him in order to make an emphatic statement. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I said that I was certainly going to be in a grave”
17:14	j535		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לָֽ⁠רִמָּֽה	1	Job is not referring to a specific **worm**. He means any worm. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to a worm”
17:14	nrr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לָֽ⁠רִמָּֽה	1	A **worm** is a small, legless creature that burrows through the ground, passing the soil through its digestive system in order to extract the nutrients that the soil contains. Worms also pass whatever else they find underground through their digestive systems, including dead bodies. If your readers would not be familiar with what a worm is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable creature in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “to a small burrowing creature”
17:15	zb7d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ֭⁠אַיֵּה אֵפ֣וֹ תִקְוָתִ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠תִקְוָתִ֗⁠י מִ֣י יְשׁוּרֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “then I would not have any real hope! No, I would not have any hope that anyone could see!”
17:15	j536		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ֭⁠אַיֵּה אֵפ֣וֹ תִקְוָתִ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠תִקְוָתִ֗⁠י מִ֣י יְשׁוּרֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “then I would not really have anything to hope for! No, I would not have anything to hope for that anyone could see!”
17:16	h77p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	בַּדֵּ֣י שְׁאֹ֣ל תֵּרַ֑דְנָה אִם־יַ֖חַד עַל־עָפָ֣ר נָֽחַת	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Then they would descend to the bars of Sheol! Then our rest would be together in the dust!”
17:16	j537		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	תֵּרַ֑דְנָה	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the hope that Job described in the previous verse. Job may be using a plural term to speak of the hope that he said would not be and the hope that he said no one would see, even though this is basically the same hope. If it would be more natural in your language, you could use a singular pronoun in your translation. Alternate translation: “Will it descend” or, as a statement, “Then it would descend”
17:16	yx83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּדֵּ֣י שְׁאֹ֣ל	1	Job is using the term **bars** to mean “gates,” by association with the way that bars keep a gate locked. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the gates of Sheol”
17:16	j538		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּדֵּ֣י שְׁאֹ֣ל	1	Job means implicitly that if his hope went down to the **bars** or gates of Sheol, it would be admitted there. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to Sheol and be admitted there”
17:16	z16e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	אִם־יַ֖חַד עַל־עָפָ֣ר נָֽחַת	1	When Job speaks of having **rest** in the **dust**, he means having died. This is a poetic way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Will we die together” or “Will my hope die with me”
17:16	ajw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אִם־יַ֖חַד עַל־עָפָ֣ר נָֽחַת	1	Job is speaking of his hope as if it were a living thing that could have **rest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do I have nothing more to hope for in this life”
18:intro	qk5f				0	# Job 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Bildad speaks to him for a second time. As Eliphaz did in his second speech to Job in chapter 15, Bildad speaks more strongly to Job in this speech than he did in his first speech. Using much of the same language that Job used in chapters 16 and 17, Bildad defends himself and the other two friends and warns Job that God will punish him severely if he continues to be wicked (as Bildad believes him to be).\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.
18:2	b4en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַד־אָ֤נָה ׀ תְּשִׂימ֣וּ⁠ן קִנְצֵ֣י לְ⁠מִלִּ֑ין	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should make an end of words right now!” or “It is not helpful for you to keep saying such things!”
18:2	jpp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַד־אָ֤נָה ׀ תְּשִׂימ֣וּ⁠ן קִנְצֵ֣י לְ⁠מִלִּ֑ין	1	Bildad is using the term **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Bildad is answering Job by using the same language that Job used in [16:3](../16/03.md). See how you translated the expression “an end to words” there; **ends of words** here is a slight variation. Alternate translation: “For how long will you keep talking”
18:2	j539		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	תְּשִׂימ֣וּ⁠ן & תָּ֝בִ֗ינוּ	1	The pronoun **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative **Consider** are plural. Bildad may be using these plural forms because he is answering Job in his own words and Job addressed “all of you” (meaning his three friends) when he asked in 16:3](../16/03.md), “Is there an end to words of wind?” Bildad could be portraying Job as representative of a group of people who think and speak as he does. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” it may be more natural to use singular forms in your translation.
18:3	b16n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַ֭דּוּעַ נֶחְשַׁ֣בְנוּ כַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֑ה נִ֝טְמִ֗ינוּ בְּ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “We should not be regarded as beasts, stupid in your eyes!”
18:3	v7r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מַ֭דּוּעַ נֶחְשַׁ֣בְנוּ כַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Why do you regard us as beasts”
18:3	j540		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֑ה	1	Bildad is using this comparison to say that just as **beasts** have no understanding, so Job regards his friends as having no understanding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “as beasts that have no understanding”
18:3	yk9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Bildad is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from your perspective”
18:3	pdy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בְּ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	The word **your** is plural here, like the word “you” in the previous verse. Since Bildad is addressing Job, it may be more natural to use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
18:4	zm4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	טֹֽרֵ֥ף נַפְשׁ֗⁠וֹ בְּ⁠אַ֫פּ֥⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking about Job in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “You who tear yourself in your nose”
18:4	j542		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	טֹֽרֵ֥ף נַפְשׁ֗⁠וֹ בְּ⁠אַ֫פּ֥⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [16:9](../16/09.md), Job spoke as if God were literally a wild animal that had **torn** him in his anger. Bildad is saying that it is actually Job who is tearing himself apart in his own anger. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “It is you who are tearing yourself apart in your anger”
18:4	ug9i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ֭⁠לְמַעַנְ⁠ךָ תֵּעָ֣זַב אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠יֶעְתַּק־צ֝֗וּר מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The earth will not be forsaken for your sake, and the rock will not move from its place!”
18:4	r5lg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תֵּעָ֣זַב אָ֑רֶץ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “will people forsake the earth” or “will people stop living on the earth”
18:4	zyh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֶעְתַּק־צ֝֗וּר מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [14:18–19](../14/19.md), Job said to God, “you destroy the hope of man,” and he compared that to the way “a rock moves from its place.” This could be a reference to an earthquake or a landslide. Bildad is implying that Job is being overly grandiose by comparing his individual situation with great natural events. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It is not as if your individual situation is a great earthquake!”
18:5	e2fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	א֣וֹר רְשָׁעִ֣ים יִדְעָ֑ךְ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִ֝גַּ֗הּ שְׁבִ֣יב אִשּֽׁ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking of the happiness and prosperity of a wicked person as if those things were literally a **light** or **flame**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “any happiness or prosperity that wicked people enjoy will not last for very long”
18:5	d868		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people” or, since Bildad uses the singular **his** later in the verse, “a wicked person”
18:6	uj2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	א֭וֹר חָשַׁ֣ךְ בְּ⁠אָהֳל֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠נֵר֗⁠וֹ עָלָ֥י⁠ו יִדְעָֽךְ	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of the happiness and prosperity of a wicked person as if those things were literally a **light** or **lamp**. He is also continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [17:12](../17/12.md), Job said that his friends were telling him that light must be near because it was presently so dark in his life. Bildad is saying here in response that wicked people may be in the light, but soon it will become dark for them. To help make this clear to your readers, it may be helpful to use the same language here that you used in [17:12](../17/12.md). Alternate translation: “Even though a wicked person may have light, darkness is near” or “Even though a wicked person may experience prosperity, soon he will have trouble instead”
18:7	fxl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יֵֽ֭צְרוּ צַעֲדֵ֣י אוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using one sign of weakness, a shortening stride, to indicate weakness in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will become weak”
18:7	j543		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	צַעֲדֵ֣י אוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using this possessive form to speak of **steps** that are characterized by **strength**. It may be more natural for you to express this meaning using a form other than a possessive. Alternate translation: “His vigorous stride”
18:7	bgk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְֽ⁠תַשְׁלִיכֵ֥⁠הוּ עֲצָתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking of a **plan** that a wicked person might make as if it were a living thing that could **cast him down**, that is, throw him or make him fall onto the ground. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his schemes will only harm him in the end”
18:8	t3iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֻׁלַּ֣ח בְּ⁠רֶ֣שֶׁת בְּ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו וְ⁠עַל־שְׂ֝בָכָ֗ה יִתְהַלָּֽךְ	1	Bildad is speaking as if a wicked person would literally be caught in a **net** or **pitfall**. He means that such a person will experience troubles that will keep him from fulfilling his plans. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will experience troubles that will keep him from fulfilling his plans”
18:8	fl11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	שֻׁלַּ֣ח בְּ⁠רֶ֣שֶׁת בְּ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	Bildad is speaking of the **feet** of a wicked person as if they were a living thing that could **cast** him **into a net**. The implication seems to be that if the feet of the wicked person, rather than his eyes and his mind, are determining where he is going, he will walk into dangers unawares. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will walk unawares into a net”
18:8	wa1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שְׂ֝בָכָ֗ה	1	A **pitfall** is a type of trap for animals. To make it, people dig a pit in the ground and cover it with netting. They then put plant materials all over the netting to make it appear that the ground above the pit is just ordinary ground. If your readers would not be familiar with what a pitfall is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a concealed trap”
18:9	t6fv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֹאחֵ֣ז בְּ⁠עָקֵ֣ב פָּ֑ח יַחֲזֵ֖ק עָלָ֣י⁠ו צַמִּֽים	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of a wicked person as if he would literally be caught in a **snare** or **trap**. If you decided in the previous verse to express the meaning of this image rather than retain it in your translation, you could restate the meaning here. Alternate translation: “Yes, a wicked person will not be able to succeed; he will fail because of all the trouble that he causes for himself”
18:9	jr8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	יֹאחֵ֣ז בְּ⁠עָקֵ֣ב פָּ֑ח	1	A **snare** was a device that people in this culture used to catch birds. It consisted of a loose loop of cord. A hunter would put seeds or other bait inside the loop. When a bird came inside the loop to eat the bait, the hunter would pull on the cord and catch the bird by its feet. A snare might also have a mechanism that a bird would trigger automatically by stepping inside the loop. Bildad is speaking as if this would happen to a wicked person, so that he would be caught **by the heel**. If your readers would not be familiar with what a snare is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “He will step into a device that will seize his foot”
18:9	j544		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	צַמִּֽים	1	By **trap**, Bildad means some other device for catching birds or animals. Interpreters are unsure exactly what this device is. The word Bildad uses suggests the idea of braiding, and so this could be a net of some kind. Alternate translation: “a net”
18:10	u5yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	טָמ֣וּן בָּ⁠אָ֣רֶץ חַבְל֑⁠וֹ וּ֝⁠מַלְכֻּדְתּ֗⁠וֹ עֲלֵ֣י נָתִֽיב	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of a wicked person as if he would literally be caught by a **rope** or **trap**. If you decided in the previous two verses to express the meaning of this image rather than retain it in your translation, you could restate the meaning in another way here.
18:10	j545		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	חַבְל֑⁠וֹ וּ֝⁠מַלְכֻּדְתּ֗⁠וֹ עֲלֵ֣י	1	In these possessive forms, **His** and **his** are the objects rather than the subjects of **rope** and **trap**. That is, Bildad is not speaking of a rope and trap that the wicked person owns but of a rope and trap that will catch the wicked person. Alternate translation: “The rope that will catch him … and the trap that will catch him is hidden”
18:10	q4wx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	טָמ֣וּן בָּ⁠אָ֣רֶץ חַבְל֑⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The ground is concealing the rope that will catch him”
18:10	xp42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חַבְל֑⁠וֹ	1	By **rope**, Bildad means some further device for catching birds or animals. He seems to mean some larger device for catching animals that would work the same way as a “snare” that catches birds. A hunter might hide a loop of rope **in the ground** and pull on the rope to catch an animal once it stepped inside the loop. Alternate translation: “a loop of rope to catch him”
18:10	f193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּ֝⁠מַלְכֻּדְתּ֗⁠וֹ עֲלֵ֣י נָתִֽיב	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and a trap is hidden for him on the path”
18:10	j546		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וּ֝⁠מַלְכֻּדְתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	It is unclear whether Bildad is talking about a specific type of **trap** here. He may be using a general term for any device that would catch a bird or animal. If your language has such a general term, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation.
18:11	ln1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וֶ⁠הֱפִיצֻ֥⁠הוּ לְ⁠רַגְלָֽי⁠ו	1	Bildad is speaking of these **Terrors** as if they were a living thing that could **chase** a wicked person the way a dog or wolf would, nipping at his **feet** to disable him so that he could not run away to safety. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he will not be able to escape from these troubles”
18:12	v7el		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְהִי־רָעֵ֥ב אֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking of the **strength** of a wicked person as if it were a living thing that could become **hungry**. He means that a wicked person’s strength becomes weakened as if by hunger. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is weakened as if by hunger”
18:12	j547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗יד נָכ֥וֹן	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who has done the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “and God has prepared disaster”
18:12	zbs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠צַלְעֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking as if **disaster** were literally at the **side** of a wicked person. He means that it will strike him as soon as there is opportunity. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to strike him as soon as there is opportunity”
18:13	u5is		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יֹ֭אכַל בַּדֵּ֣י עוֹר֑⁠וֹ יֹאכַ֥ל בַּ֝דָּ֗י⁠ו בְּכ֣וֹר מָֽוֶת	1	The pronoun **It** refers to **the firstborn of death** later in the verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put the noun phrase in the first part of the verse and the pronoun in the second part of the verse. Alternate translation: “The firstborn of death devours parts of his skin; it devours his parts”
18:13	mrr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּכ֣וֹר מָֽוֶת	1	The expression **the firstborn of death** means the strongest kind of death or a terrible kind of death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a deadly disease”
18:13	j548		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בַּ֝דָּ֗י⁠ו	1	Since the pronoun **his** in this possessive form refers to the wicked person as a whole, it is likely that the word **parts** describes his arms and his legs. Alternate translation: “his arms and his legs”
18:14	j549		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִנָּתֵ֣ק & וְ֝⁠תַצְעִדֵ֗⁠הוּ	1	If terror is indeed the agent that Bildad says pulls the wicked person from his tent, then Bildad is speaking of terror as if it were a living thing that could do this. He actually means that the disasters that cause a wicked person to feel terror also deprive him of safety and security. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The disasters that cause him to feel terror take him away … and they march him”
18:14	m1gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִנָּתֵ֣ק	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, from the context it appears that this may be terror itself, since terror seems to be personified in the second part of the verse. Alternate translation: “Terror pulls him”
18:14	r3dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ֝⁠תַצְעִדֵ֗⁠הוּ לְ⁠מֶ֣לֶךְ בַּלָּהֽוֹת	1	The pronoun **one** probably refers to terror. The pronoun is feminine, as is the word “terror,” and Hebrew speakers sometimes used feminine pronouns to represent feminine subjects they had not yet named but which they had in mind. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and terror marches him to its king”
18:14	atl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠תַצְעִדֵ֗⁠הוּ לְ⁠מֶ֣לֶךְ בַּלָּהֽוֹת	1	If the pronoun **one** does refer to terror, then Bildad is speaking of terror as if it were a living thing, a soldier, who could march a captured enemy to his **king** as a prisoner. Once again Bildad would be using terror to mean the disasters that cause a wicked person to feel terror. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the disasters that cause him to feel terror bring him to the king of terrors”
18:14	j550		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠תַצְעִדֵ֗⁠הוּ לְ⁠מֶ֣לֶךְ בַּלָּהֽוֹת	1	Like the expression “the firstborn of death” in the previous verse, the expression **the king of terrors** here is a superlative. It means the worst terror there is, specifically, death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the disasters that cause him to feel terror ultimately cause him to die”
18:15	j551		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תִּשְׁכּ֣וֹן בְּ֭⁠אָהֳל⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **One** is feminine in this verse, as in the previous verse, and so it may refer once again to terror. (However, interpreters have a range of understandings of what this verse means.) Alternate translation: “Terror will dwell in his tent”
18:15	n4sy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠בְּלִי־ל֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad means implicitly that the **tent** will no longer belong to the wicked person, probably because he will be dead (a prisoner of the “king of terrors,” death, as the previous verse describes). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “which will be abandoned because he is dead”
18:15	fpm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יְזֹרֶ֖ה עַל־נָוֵ֣⁠הוּ גָפְרִֽית	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God scatters sulfur upon his home” or “God destroys his home by raining burning sulfur on it”
18:16	uul5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ֭⁠תַּחַת שָֽׁרָשָׁ֣י⁠ו יִבָ֑שׁוּ וּ֝⁠מִ⁠מַּ֗עַל יִמַּ֥ל קְצִירֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking as if the wicked person were literally a tree that dies from lack of moisture. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He fails in every aspect of life and finally he dies”
18:16	u1by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	יִמַּ֥ל קְצִירֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is not referring to a specific **branch**. He means every branch on the tree that he is using to symbolize the wicked person. If you retain the image in your translation, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. Alternate translation: “his branches wither”
18:17	m6xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	זִֽכְר⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using this possessive form to mean other people’s **memory** of the wicked person, not the wicked person’s memory of things. Alternate translation: “The memory of him”
18:17	j552		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִנִּי־אָ֑רֶץ	1	Bildad is using the term **earth** by association to mean the people who live on the earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from among the people who live on the earth”
18:17	y9j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שֵׁ֥ם	1	Here, **name** represents a person’s fame and reputation. Alternate translation: “reputation”
18:17	fs6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־פְּנֵי־חֽוּץ	1	Bildad is speaking as if the surface of the land or ground were literally its **face**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “upon the surface of the land”
18:18	er2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יֶ֭הְדְּפֻ⁠הוּ מֵ⁠א֣וֹר אֶל־חֹ֑שֶׁךְ	1	The pronoun **They** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be more natural in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “He will be driven from light into darkness”
18:18	w8ix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֶ֭הְדְּפֻ⁠הוּ מֵ⁠א֣וֹר אֶל־חֹ֑שֶׁךְ	1	Bildad is using the term **light** to represent life and the term **darkness** to represent death. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will be driven from among the living into the abode of the dead”
18:18	dr9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וּֽ⁠מִ⁠תֵּבֵ֥ל יְנִדֻּֽ⁠הוּ	1	The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “yes, he will be chased from the world”
18:20	wn9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	עַל־י֭וֹמ⁠וֹ נָשַׁ֣מּוּ אַחֲרֹנִ֑ים וְ֝⁠קַדְמֹנִ֗ים אָ֣חֲזוּ שָֽׂעַר	1	Bildad is using two groups of people to mean all people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. This could mean: (1) people who live after God punishes the wicked person and people who were alive beforehand and recognized that God would punish the wicked person. Alternate translation: “The way God punishes him will make a great impression on everyone who ever hears of him” (2) people who live to the west of the wicked person and people who live to the east of the wicked person. Alternate translation: “The way God punishes him will make a great impression on the people who live all around him”
18:20	j553		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אַחֲרֹנִ֑ים וְ֝⁠קַדְמֹנִ֗ים	1	If Bildad is speaking of people who live **after** and **before** God punishes the wicked person, then he is using those adjectives as nouns to mean certain groups of people. The ULT adds the word **ones** in each case to suggest this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Those who live after him … and those who see what is going to happen to him”
18:20	r4pt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	י֭וֹמ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using the term **day** to mean what happens to the wicked person at a particular time, the time when God punishes him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what happens to him when God punishes him”
18:20	j554		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָ֣חֲזוּ שָֽׂעַר	1	Bildad is speaking as if **horror** were literally an object that people could **seize**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will become horrified”
18:21	da3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַךְ־אֵ֭לֶּה מִשְׁכְּנ֣וֹת עַוָּ֑ל וְ֝⁠זֶ֗ה מְק֣וֹם לֹא־יָדַֽע־אֵֽל	1	Bildad is speaking as if all the misfortunes he has described were literally the **dwellings** of wicked people, the **place** where they live. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this is what will happen to the wicked, yes, this is the fate of one who does not know God”
18:21	j555		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עַוָּ֑ל	1	Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
19:intro	vq57				0	# Job 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is Job’s response to Bildad’s second speech. It is structured as a chiasm. (See the discussion of that poetic form in the General Introduction to Job.)\n- Verses 1–7: Job rebukes his friends for not being sympathetic to him.\n- Verses 8–1: Job uses images to describe how God has made him suffer.\n- Verses 13–19: Job describes how his family and friends have abandoned him.\n- Verses 20–21: Job uses images to describe how God has made him suffer.\n- Verse 22: Job rebukes his friends for not being sympathetic to him.\n- Verses 23–24: Job wishes that people would hear his defense and he foresees that God will vindicate him.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Job’s Faith\n\nIn verses 25–27, Job shows the great depth of his faith in God even after suffering so much. Job believes that even if God is treating him unfairly now, God will ultimately do the right thing. Job does not understand that God is actually not treating him unfairly. But the faith and confidence that he nevertheless has in God are remarkable. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
19:2	xxa9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַד־אָ֭נָה תּוֹגְי֣וּ⁠ן נַפְשִׁ֑⁠י וּֽ⁠תְדַכְּאוּ⁠נַ֥נִי בְ⁠מִלִּֽים	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have afflicted my soul and crushed me with words for long enough!”
19:2	j556		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תּוֹגְי֣וּ⁠ן & וּֽ⁠תְדַכְּאוּ⁠נַ֥נִי	1	The word **you** is plural here and through verse 5 because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
19:2	j557		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נַפְשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “me”
19:2	r3lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠תְדַכְּאוּ⁠נַ֥נִי בְ⁠מִלִּֽים	1	Job is speaking as if his friends could literally **crush** him with their **words**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and discourage me deeply with your words”
19:2	j558		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠מִלִּֽים	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what his friends have been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by what you have been saying”
19:3	k4th		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עֶ֣שֶׂר פְּ֭עָמִים	1	The expression **ten times** means “many times,” not literally ten times, no more and no less. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “many times”
19:3	uy8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-sentences	לֹֽא־תֵ֝בֹ֗שׁוּ תַּהְכְּרוּ־לִֽ⁠י	1	In this sentence structure, the verb **mistreat** is dependent on the verb **ashamed**. It may be more natural in your language to use a different sentence structure. Alternate translation: “you are not ashamed to mistreat me”
19:4	bfn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִ֝תִּ֗⁠י תָּלִ֥ין מְשׁוּגָתִֽ⁠י	1	Interpreters are not certain what Job means by this statement. He could mean: (1) that any sin he might have committed would be his own private concern. This would be consistent with his rebuke of his friends for reproaching him publicly as a sinner. Alternate translation: “that would be my own private concern” (2) that he would be the only one who would know for sure whether he had sinned. Alternate translation: “that would be for me to determine”
19:5	z7gm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָלַ֣⁠י תַּגְדִּ֑ילוּ וְ⁠תוֹכִ֥יחוּ עָ֝לַ֗⁠י חֶרְפָּתִּֽ⁠י	1	See how you translated the similar use of the term **exalt** in [17:4](../17/04.md). Alternate translation: “you want to prove that you are right and I am wrong by appealing to the way that I am suffering”
19:6	gb9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מְצוּד֗⁠וֹ עָלַ֥⁠י הִקִּֽיף	1	Job is speaking as if a **net** that God had set as a trap had literally **closed around** him. Job is answering Bildad in his own words, but Job is making the net a symbol of the unjust punishment of the innocent rather than of the just punishment of the wicked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he has unfairly punished me even though I am innocent”
19:7	zyg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶצְעַ֣ק חָ֭מָס	1	The expression **Violence!** refers generally to mistreatment, including but not limited to actual violence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I cry, ‘Someone is mistreating me’”
19:7	j559		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֶצְעַ֣ק חָ֭מָס	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I protest that someone is mistreating me”
19:7	j560		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֣א אֵעָנֶ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “but no one answers me”
19:7	i4w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין מִשְׁפָּֽט	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “but no one ensures that I am treated justly”
19:8	dpr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָרְחִ֣⁠י גָ֭דַר וְ⁠לֹ֣א אֶעֱב֑וֹר	1	Job is speaking of his life as if it were a **way** or path that he was walking along, and he is speaking as if God had built a wall to block that path so that he could not continue on it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar image in [3:23](../03/23.md). Alternate translation: “God has kept me from being able to overcome my troubles and resume my regular life”
19:8	ly9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַ֥ל נְ֝תִיבוֹתַ֗⁠י חֹ֣שֶׁךְ יָשִֽׂים	1	In a parallel image, Job is speaking of his activities as if they were **paths** on which he was walking, and he is speaking as if God had made it so dark on those paths that he could not walk on them because he could not see where he was going. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, God has prevented me from knowing the right things to do”
19:9	hjr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כְּ֭בוֹדִ⁠י מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י הִפְשִׁ֑יט	1	Job is speaking as if the **glory** or honor that he formerly had were literally an article of clothing that God had **stripped** from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He has taken away the honor that I formerly had”
19:9	rf7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ֝⁠יָּ֗סַר עֲטֶ֣רֶת רֹאשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he had formerly been wearing an actual **crown**, a symbol of ruling authority, and that God had **removed** that crown from his **head**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he has deprived me of the authority I once had”
19:9	j561		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	עֲטֶ֣רֶת רֹאשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Job is using this possessive form to speak symbolically of a crown that he once wore on his head. In the context, the phrase **the crown of my head** does not mean the very top of Job’s head. Alternate translation: “the crown that I once wore on my head”
19:10	tiq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִתְּצֵ֣⁠נִי סָ֭בִיב	1	Job is speaking as he were literally a building and God had **broken** him **down** completely. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He has destroyed everything in my life”
19:10	r4pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וָ⁠אֵלַ֑ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if he has literally **gone away** or left the area where he was formerly living. See how you translated the similar expression in [14:20](../14/20.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Job is speaking of what he expects to happen imminently as if it had already happened. Alternate translation: “and I am about to die”
19:10	jd8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וַ⁠יַּסַּ֥ע כָּ֝⁠עֵ֗ץ תִּקְוָתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using this comparison to say that just as a tree will not grow again once it has been completely uprooted, so he believes that God has taken away his hope forever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he has taken away my hope forever, just as an uprooted tree will never grow back”
19:10	v64y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יַּסַּ֥ע כָּ֝⁠עֵ֗ץ תִּקְוָתִֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and he has kept me from ever hoping again, just as an uprooted tree will never grow back”
19:11	p3my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּ֣חַר עָלַ֣⁠י אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **kindled** his anger or set it on fire. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And he has allowed himself to become very angry with me”
19:12	wkz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יַ֤חַד ׀ יָ֘בֹ֤אוּ גְדוּדָ֗י⁠ו וַ⁠יָּסֹ֣לּוּ עָלַ֣⁠י דַּרְכָּ֑⁠ם וַ⁠יַּחֲנ֖וּ סָבִ֣יב לְ⁠אָהֳלִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a city and God had sent **troops** to lay siege to that city, building **ramps** by which they could get over its walls. Job is likely speaking of the troubles he is experiencing as if they were soldiers whom God had sent to attack him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God has made me experience many kinds of troubles, and they are causing me more and more distress”
19:12	fg89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּחֲנ֖וּ סָבִ֣יב לְ⁠אָהֳלִֽ⁠י	1	Job continues the military image but changes it slightly when he speaks as if he were literally a **tent** around which an enemy army had encamped. Job may be picturing himself as one of a number of soldiers who are all staying in tents but whose camp an enemy army has surrounded. Or Job may be using the word **tent** simply to mean the place where he lives, that is, his life. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, I am experiencing troubles in many different aspects of my life”
19:13	zk2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַ֭חַ⁠י מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י הִרְחִ֑יק	1	Job is speaking as if God had removed his **brothers** to a distance from him. Job is actually speaking of the diminished quality of the relationship he now has with them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He has caused my brothers to withdraw from me”
19:13	j563		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַ֭חַ⁠י	1	Job is probably using the word **brothers** to mean close relatives, both male and female, who may not literally be his siblings. Your language may use that word or an equivalent term in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “my close relatives”
19:13	iv61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠יֹדְעַ֗⁠י אַךְ־זָ֥רוּ מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי	1	Job is speaking as if his **acquaintances** had literally **turned away** from him, that is, turned to face in another direction so that they could not see him or turned and walked away from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my acquaintances now act as if they do not even know me”
19:14	l2e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠מְיֻדָּעַ֥⁠י שְׁכֵחֽוּ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if his **familiar friends** had literally **forgotten** him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “act as if they never knew me”
19:15	kz75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	גָּ֘רֵ֤י בֵיתִ֣⁠י	1	Job is using this possessive form to refer to people who have stayed in his **house** as **Guests**. Alternate translation: “People who once stayed in my house as guests”
19:15	y376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from their perspective” or “as far as they are concerned”
19:16	x8ak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠עַבְדִּ֣⁠י קָ֭רָאתִי וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲנֶ֑ה	1	In this context, the word **call** implicitly means “summon” and the word **answer** implicitly means “obey.” You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I summon my servant, but he does not obey and come to me”
19:16	j564		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לְ⁠עַבְדִּ֣⁠י	1	Job is not referring to a specific **servant**. He means all of his servants. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “to my servants“
19:16	hds8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּמוֹ־פִ֝֗⁠י אֶתְחַנֶּן־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he has to say with his mouth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have to speak pleadingly to him”
19:17	dgg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ר֭וּחִֽ⁠י זָ֣רָה לְ⁠אִשְׁתִּ֑⁠י	1	This could mean: (1) that Job is using one part of himself, his **breath**, to mean all of himself. In verses 13–19, Job is talking about how all of his friends and relatives now treat him as if they did not know him. In verses 13 and 15, Job uses words related to the word that the ULT translates as **strange** in this verse. Alternate translation: “I am like a stranger to my wife” (2) that Job is referring literally to his **breath** and saying that because of his sickness, it smells bad and is offensive to his wife. Alternate translation: “Because of my sickness, my breath smells bad and is offensive to my wife”
19:17	ufr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ֝⁠חַנֹּתִ֗י לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י בִטְנִֽ⁠י	1	Job is the possessive form **of my womb** to mean the womb of his wife. He is speaking of the children that they had together. Alternate translation: “even though we had children together and I treated them kindly”
19:18	fp7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אָ֝ק֗וּמָה וַ⁠יְדַבְּרוּ־בִֽ⁠י	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that when Job stands up to speak, younger people who should listen respectfully (see [32:6–7](../32/06.md)) contradict him instead. Alternate translation: “when I stand up to speak, younger people disrespectfully contradict me” (2) that when Job tries to stand up, struggling because of his sickness, children make fun of him. Alternate translation: “when I struggle to stand up, they make fun of me”
19:19	uf7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מְתֵ֣י סוֹדִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe the **friends** with whom he took **counsel**, that is, the friends with whom he shared his private thoughts and whose advice he asked. Alternate translation: “the friends in whom I confided”
19:19	t7hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נֶהְפְּכוּ־בִֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “have turned against me”
19:20	j565		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְּ⁠עוֹרִ֣⁠י וּ֭⁠בִ⁠בְשָׂרִ⁠י דָּבְקָ֣ה עַצְמִ֑⁠י	1	Job is not referring to a specific **bone**. He means all of his bones. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh”
19:20	lt45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בְּ⁠עוֹרִ֣⁠י וּ֭⁠בִ⁠בְשָׂרִ⁠י דָּבְקָ֣ה עַצְמִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking of this representative **bone** as if it were living thing that could **cling** to his **skin** and **flesh**. He means that his bones are right next to his skin and flesh, that is, all of the muscle in between has wasted away. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am just skin and bones”
19:20	ud4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וָ֝⁠אֶתְמַלְּטָ֗⁠ה בְּ⁠ע֣וֹר שִׁנָּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he had barely **escaped** from some disaster, and he is describing what he was able to escape with. Interpreters have different ideas about what he is describing, but they generally agree that it means something insignificant. Alternate translation: “and there is practically nothing left of me”
19:21	ux63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	חָנֻּ֬⁠נִי חָנֻּ֣⁠נִי	1	Job is repeating the verb **Pity** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Please have pity on me”
19:21	tbg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַד־אֱ֝ל֗וֹהַּ נָ֣גְעָה בִּֽ⁠י	1	Here the **hand of God** represents the power and activity of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God is powerfully afflicting me”
19:22	g28h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֭⁠מָּה תִּרְדְּפֻ֣⁠נִי כְמוֹ־אֵ֑ל וּ֝⁠מִ⁠בְּשָׂרִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תִשְׂבָּֽעוּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You should not pursue me as God would! You should be satisfied with my flesh!”
19:22	c296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	לָ֭⁠מָּה תִּרְדְּפֻ֣⁠נִי כְמוֹ־אֵ֑ל	1	The point of this comparison is that just as God would **pursue** someone relentlessly to make sure that sin was punished appropriately, so Job’s friends have been relentlessly insisting that he has sinned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Why do you insist relentlessly that I have sinned” or, as a statement, “You should not insist relentlessly that I have sinned”
19:22	y17f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠בְּשָׂרִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תִשְׂבָּֽעוּ	1	Job is likely alluding to a popular expression. In this culture, if someone accused another person maliciously, people said that he was “eating the pieces” of that person. Job is suggesting that his friends are ”eating“ him in this sense (that is, accusing him maliciously) and they are not yet **satisfied** with the amount of his **flesh** that they have ”eaten.“ If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And will you never stop accusing me maliciously” or, as a statement, “Yes, you should stop accusing me so maliciously”
19:23	r9n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן אֵ֭פוֹ וְ⁠יִכָּתְב֣וּ⁠ן מִלָּ֑⁠י מִֽי־יִתֵּ֖ן בַּ⁠סֵּ֣פֶר וְ⁠יֻחָֽקוּ	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: “I wish that my words would now be written down! I wish that they would be inscribed on a scroll!”
19:23	j566		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן אֵ֭פוֹ וְ⁠יִכָּתְב֣וּ⁠ן מִלָּ֑⁠י מִֽי־יִתֵּ֖ן בַּ⁠סֵּ֣פֶר וְ⁠יֻחָֽקוּ	1	In context, Job is suggesting that this is actually unlikely, even though he wishes that it could happen. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “It is unfortunate that my words cannot be written down. It is unfortunate that they cannot be inscribed on a scroll”
19:23	j567		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יִכָּתְב֣וּ⁠ן מִלָּ֑⁠י	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone will write down my words”
19:23	llm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what he has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I have been saying”
19:23	ti7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בַּ⁠סֵּ֣פֶר וְ⁠יֻחָֽקוּ	1	Job is speaking as if he wanted his **words** literally to be **inscribed** or engraved on a **scroll**. He could mean: (1) that he wants someone to record them meticulously on a scroll. Alternate translation: “they will be recorded on a scroll” (2) that he wants someone to engrave them onto a copper sheet. Alternate translation: “they will be inscribed on a copper sheet”
19:23	j568		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יֻחָֽקוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone will inscribe them”
19:24	gz9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠עֵט־בַּרְזֶ֥ל	1	A **stylus** was an iron tool that people in this culture used to engrave writing onto hard surfaces. They would strike the stylus with another tool such as a hammer in order to remove tiny pieces of the surface a little at a time in order to create letters. For better visibility, they would sometimes then fill these letters with lead, which is a soft metal that they could pound into shape. If your readers would not be familiar with what a stylus is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “With a small iron tool cutting tool”
19:25	j569		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י יָ֭דַעְתִּי	1	Job is using the word translated **But** to draw a contrast between what he has just suggested is unlikely, that his claims of innocence will be recorded for posterity, and something that he is very confident about, that his **redeemer** will ultimately vindicate him as innocent. In your translation, you may wish to introduce this verse in a way that will indicate this contrast more explicitly. Alternate translation: “But even though it is unlikely that my claims of innocence will be recorded for posterity, I still know that”
19:25	j570		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י יָ֭דַעְתִּי	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “But I know very well {that}”
19:25	j571		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גֹּ֣אֲלִ⁠י חָ֑י	1	Job means implicitly that even though he expects to die, his **redeemer** will still be alive to vindicate him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “even though I expect to die soon, my redeemer will still be alive”
19:25	q57z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	גֹּ֣אֲלִ⁠י	1	A **redeemer** was a close relative who would take responsibility to do whatever was necessary to help another family member who was threatened or in need. Your language and culture may have a name for a person who fulfills this role, and you could use that name in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the close relative who will vindicate me”
19:25	j573		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	גֹּ֣אֲלִ⁠י	1	As Job indicates in the next verse, he believes that God will be his **redeemer**. This is similar to the way that Job speaks in [16:19](../16/19.md) of having an “advocate” in heaven and to the way that he asks God in [17:3](../17/03.md) to be his “surety.” Since Job speaks of God in the next verse, you do not need to explain in this verse that God is the **redeemer** whom Job is expecting. It may even be that Job wishes to generate some suspense and attention by not naming the redeemer right away, and it would be good to give your readers that same experience.
19:25	j574		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ֝⁠אַחֲר֗וֹן	1	Job is using the adjective **last** as a noun to mean a certain time. This could mean: (1) a “later” time, after Job has died. Alternate translation: “after I have died” (2) that Job is the “last” time, the time at the end of the world. Alternate translation: “and that at the end of the world”
19:25	yy3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	יָקֽוּם	1	In this culture, people stood up when they were about to speak. This was a symbolic action by which they indicated that they had something important to say. Standing up commanded the attention of the people they wanted to listen to them. In this context, the important thing that the redeemer had to say would be that Job was innocent. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “he will stand and speak in my defense”
19:25	j575		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־עָפָ֥ר	1	Job is using the term **dust** by association to mean the earth, on whose surface there is dust. This may also be a poetic allusion to the fact that Job would be dead and at “rest” in the “dust,” as he said in [17:16](../17/16.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “upon the earth”
19:26	j576		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אַחַ֣ר ע֭וֹרִֽ⁠י נִקְּפוּ־זֹ֑את	1	The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “and that after my skin has been stricken off”
19:26	t5gt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אַחַ֣ר ע֭וֹרִֽ⁠י נִקְּפוּ־זֹ֑את	1	Job is speaking as if someone or something might literally **strike** the **skin** off his bones. He could mean: (1) that his body will decay so that only the bones are left. Alternate translation: “and that even after my body decays so that only the bones are left” (2) that worms, such as he mentioned in [17:14](../17/14.md), will eat the skin off his bones. Alternate translation: “and that even after worms eat the skin off my bones”
19:26	j577		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠בְּשָׂרִ֗⁠י	1	Job could be saying that he will **behold God**: (1) from the vantage point of his flesh, that is, from within his body. This would be an implicit expression of faith and confidence in the resurrection of the body. Alternate translation: “yet from my resurrected body” (2) apart from his flesh, that is, as a spirit after death. Alternate translation: “yet as a spirit after death”
19:26	p2pl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶֽחֱזֶ֥ה אֱלֽוֹהַּ	1	As the General Notes to chapter 13 discuss, in this culture, a subject would be able to look a sovereign in the face if the sovereign favored that subject. Job seems to be alluding here to that cultural norm. The implication is that God will no longer consider him guilty but acknowledge that he was innocent all along. Job indicates in the previous verse that God will also acknowledge his innocence publicly to everyone on earth. Alternate translation: “I will be able to look God in the face because he will affirm that I am innocent”
19:27	j578		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֲנִ֨י ׀ אֶֽחֱזֶה־לִּ֗⁠י וְ⁠עֵינַ֣⁠י רָא֣וּ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “I myself will see very clearly”
19:27	j579		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִ֨י ׀ אֶֽחֱזֶה	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **will behold**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly behold”
19:27	m1wt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עֵינַ֣⁠י רָא֣וּ	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eyes**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and see with my own eyes”
19:27	k566		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠לֹא־זָ֑ר	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. In this context, the word **stranger** means “someone else.” But it is also an allusion to what Job said in verse 15, that people who knew him now regard him as a “stranger.” Alternate translation: “and it will not be someone else who beholds him”
19:27	c3pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כָּל֖וּ כִלְיֹתַ֣⁠י בְּ⁠חֵקִֽ⁠י	1	Here, the **kidneys** represents the emotions. Job is saying that he is overcome with emotion at the thought of seeing God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am overcome with emotion at this thought”
19:28	np8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כִּ֣י תֹ֭אמְרוּ מַה־נִּרְדָּף־ל֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠שֹׁ֥רֶשׁ דָּ֝בָ֗ר נִמְצָא־בִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “If you say that you are still going to persecute me because you believe that the root of the matter is found in me”
19:28	j580		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תֹ֭אמְרוּ	1	The word **you** is plural here because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
19:28	ddd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שֹׁ֥רֶשׁ דָּ֝בָ֗ר	1	Job is saying that his friends might speak as if his situation were literally a plant that had a **root**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “For the cause of the problem”
19:28	j581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בִֽ⁠י	1	Job seems to begin this hypothetical saying of the three friends as a direct quotation but finish it as an indirect quotation, saying **in me** rather than “in him.” It may be more natural in your language to finish the quotation as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “in him”
19:29	j582		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חֶ֗רֶב	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of someone or something by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “of the presence of the sword”
19:29	tw35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חֶ֗רֶב	1	Job is using one kind of severe punishment, execution by a **sword**, to mean severe punishment in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that God may punish you severely”
19:29	t8gg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	חֵ֭מָה עֲוֺנ֣וֹת חָ֑רֶב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wrath**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when God becomes angry at people for being wicked, God punishes them severely”
19:29	n1i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ש⁠דין	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “that God punishes wickedness justly”
20:intro	p78g				0	# Job 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the second speech of Job’s friend Zophar. In this chapter, Zophar speaks more strongly to Job than he did the first time spoke to him.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Zophar answering Job with his own words\n\nIn [7:8](../07/08.md), as Job was appealing to God, he said, “The eye of the one seeing me will not regard me; your eyes will be on me, but I will not exist.” Zophar says in [20:9](../20/09.md) about the wicked person, “The eye that saw him will not continue.” Job said in [7:10](../01/01.md) of himself as a mortal person, “He will not return again to his house, and his place will not know him again.” Zophar says of the wicked person in [20:9](../01/01.md), “his place will no longer observe him.” In both instances Zophar is suggesting that Job himself is a wicked person, using Job’s own words.\n\nSimilarly, Zophar says in [20:27](../20/27.md) of the wicked person that “the heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will raise itself up against him” as a witness. In [16:18](../16/18.md), Job called upon the earth to see that he received justice, and in [16:19](../16/19.md), Job said that he had an advocate in the heavens. So Zophar is likely answering Job once again in his own words, implying that Job himself is a wicked person of the type that he has been describing in his speech.\n\nTo help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate what Zophar says in these instances similarly to the way you translated what Job said earlier.\n\n### Indelicate images that Zophar uses\n\nAs noted above, Zophar speaks strongly to Job in this speech. He uses a couple of images drawn from bodily functions that people in your culture might consider indelicate to include in a Bible translation. If so, you could use comparable images. Zophar says in [20:7](../20/07.md) of the wicked person, “he will perish forever like his dung.” You could refer to something else that disappears completely, saying, for example, “he will perish forever like the dust that the wind blows away.” Zophar says of the wicked person in [20:15](../20/15.md), “He swallows wealth, but he will vomit it.” You might say instead something such as, “Though he may become rich, he will lose all his money.”
20:2	j583		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	לָ֭⁠כֵן	1	Zophar is using the word **Therefore** to introduce the reason he is about to give for why he is speaking to Job again. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “This is why”
20:2	eef1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	שְׂעִפַּ֣⁠י יְשִׁיב֑וּ⁠נִי	1	Zophar is speaking of his **thoughts** as if they were a living thing that could **turn** him **back**, that is, make him turn around and return to Job as if he had left him. He means that he wants to speak to Job again and share what he is thinking in response to what Job has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I need to speak to you again and tell you what I am thinking”
20:2	wy6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וּ֝⁠בַ⁠עֲב֗וּר ח֣וּשִׁ⁠י בִֽ⁠י	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “because I feel such urgency”
20:3	m5c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מוּסַ֣ר כְּלִמָּתִ֣⁠י	1	Zophar is using this possessive form to describe a **rebuke** that he feels has brought **dishonor** to him. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “a rebuke that dishonors me”
20:3	pk2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ מִֽ⁠בִּינָתִ֥⁠י יַעֲנֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Zophar is speaking as if there were a **spirit** in his **understanding** that could **answer** him, that is, show him how to respond to Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but I have had a good idea that enables me to understand how I should respond”
20:4	um5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠זֹ֣את יָ֭דַעְתָּ מִנִּי־עַ֑ד מִנִּ֤י שִׂ֖ים אָדָ֣ם עֲלֵי־אָֽרֶץ	1	Zophar is using the question form for emphasis. (The question continues into the next verse.) If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Surely you are aware of this from long ago, from the placing of man upon the earth”
20:4	j584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	הֲ⁠זֹ֣את יָ֭דַעְתָּ מִנִּי־עַ֑ד מִנִּ֤י שִׂ֖ים אָדָ֣ם עֲלֵי־אָֽרֶץ	1	Zophar is speaking as if Job himself should have known **from long ago** what he is about to say. He means that Job is one member of the human community that has known this for as long as it has existed.

This could mean: (1) that Zophar is alluding to the images in verses 12 and 13 of a wicked person savoring wickedness as if it were something he held under his tongue or against the roof of his mouth. Zophar would be saying that the delicacy that the wicked person savors or sucks turns out to be poison, meaning something that will kill him. Alternate translation: “In the end, the wickedness that he savors will kill him” (2) that an asp will bite the wicked person and he will absorb its **poison** as if he had sucked it in.

20:26	w47r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תְּ֭אָכְלֵ⁠הוּ אֵ֣שׁ לֹֽא־נֻפָּ֑ח	1	The implication is that no human being will have **blown** on this **fire** to kindle it; God will send the fire. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “A fire that God sends will devour him” or “God will send fire that will devour him”
20:26	qsw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תְּ֭אָכְלֵ⁠הוּ אֵ֣שׁ לֹֽא־נֻפָּ֑ח	1	Zophar is speaking as if **fire** were literally going to **devour** or eat up this wicked person. Within the context of the image, he means that the fire will burn him up, and the image of fire itself represents God destroying the wicked person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God will destroy him”
20:26	j614		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֵ֖רַע שָׂרִ֣יד בְּ⁠אָהֳלֽ⁠וֹ	1	Zophar is continuing to speak as if **fire** were literally going to **consume** this wicked person and his possessions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, God will completely destroy everything in his tent, leaving nothing”
20:26	j615		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יֵ֖רַע שָׂרִ֣יד בְּ⁠אָהֳלֽ⁠וֹ	1	Zophar is using one possession of this wicked person, the **tent** in which he lives, to mean all of his possessions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, God will completely destroy all of his possessions, leaving nothing”
20:27	v1vg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְגַלּ֣וּ שָׁמַ֣יִם עֲוֺנ֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠אֶ֗רֶץ מִתְקוֹמָ֘מָ֥ה לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Zophar is speaking as if the **heavens** and the **earth** were living things that could testify against this wicked person. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “If the sky could speak, it would testify that it had observed his iniquity; if the earth could speak, it would raise itself up against him”
20:27	j616		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠אֶ֗רֶץ מִתְקוֹמָ֘מָ֥ה לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Zophar means that the earth would **raise itself up**, that is, stand up, against this wicked person in order to bring charges against him or to serve as a witness in a legal proceeding. In this culture, in order to begin a case against someone, a person would stand up among those who had gathered in the public square. Someone who had evidence to bring in such a proceeding would similarly stand up. Either way, the earth, Zophar says, would testify that the wicked person was guilty. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and the earth will stand and bring charges against him” or “and the earth will stand and be a witness against him”
20:28	j617		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִ֭גֶל יְב֣וּל בֵּית֑⁠וֹ	1	Zophar is speaking of the **wealth** that the wicked person has in his **house** as if it were a living thing that could **depart**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will lose the wealth that is in his house”
20:28	j618		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נִ֝גָּר֗וֹת	1	Zophar is speaking as if the wicked person’s **wealth** were a liquid that could literally be **flowing away**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “vanishing” or “being destroyed”
20:28	j620		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠י֣וֹם אַפּֽ⁠וֹ	1	While God would punish the wicked person on a specific **day**, Zophar is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at the time when God angrily punishes him”
20:29	j621		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זֶ֤ה ׀ חֵֽלֶק־אָדָ֣ם רָ֭שָׁע מֵ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים וְ⁠נַחֲלַ֖ת אִמְר֣⁠וֹ מֵ⁠אֵֽל	1	Zophar is speaking as if God were literally giving a **wicked man** a **portion**, probably meaning a portion of family property, and a **heritage**, similarly meaning an inheritance. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is the punishment that the wicked man deserves, and God will punish him in that way”
20:29	j622		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָדָ֣ם רָ֭שָׁע	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “the wicked person”
20:29	j623		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אָדָ֣ם רָ֭שָׁע	1	Zophar is not referring to a specific **wicked man** or person. He means wicked people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
20:29	j624		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠נַחֲלַ֖ת אִמְר֣⁠וֹ מֵ⁠אֵֽל	1	Zophar is using this possessive form to describe a symbolic **heritage** or inheritance that God has appointed to a wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and his appointed heritage from God” or “and the heritage that God has appointed to him”
21:intro	k6tx				0	# Job 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is Job’s response to Zophar’s second speech.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Punishment for the sins of one’s parents or ancestors\nIn the culture in which the book of Job was composed, people commonly believed that God might punish someone for the sins of their parents or ancestors. Job says in verse 19 of this chapter that this is what his three friends believe. However, while people’s sins may have consequences for their children and descendants, God does not punish people directly for their parents’ or ancestors’ sins. Be sure that this is clear in your translation.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The adjective “wicked” as a noun\n\nIn verses 7, 16, 17, and 28, Job uses the adjective “wicked” as a noun to mean wicked people in general. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase such as “wicked people.”
21:2	ztr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שָׁ֭מוֹעַ & תַּנְח֥וּמֹֽתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **hear** are plural because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
21:2	l3vp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שִׁמְע֣וּ שָׁ֭מוֹעַ מִלָּתִ֑⁠י	1	Job is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully to my words”
21:2	j625		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלָּתִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I am about to say”
21:2	j626		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	תַּנְח֥וּמֹֽתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe not the **consolation** that his friends will have but the **consolation** that he wants them to offer him. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the consolation that you offer to me”
21:3	x7gy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שָׂ֭אוּ⁠נִי & תַלְעִֽיג	1	The implied “you” in the imperative **Tolerate** is plural because Job is addressing his three friends, but the pronoun **you** later in the verse is singular because Job is responding directly to Zophar. Use the corresponding forms in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you.”
21:3	j627		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֲדַבֵּ֑ר	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **speak**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and I will take my turn and speak”
21:3	w3a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	תַלְעִֽיג	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “you will probably continue to mock me, even though you should not do so”
21:4	d6w5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “my complaint is not to a man!”
21:4	j628		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job does not mean specifically a male human. He is using the term to mean a mortal as opposed to God. Alternate translation: “my complaint is not to a mortal!”
21:4	j629		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “my complaint is to God!”
21:4	j630		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אִם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. (Some languages may be able to say simply “And if not” to follow up on a question that expects a negative answer.) Alternate translation: “And if my complaint is not to a mortal but to God”
21:4	j631		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַ֝דּ֗וּעַ לֹא־תִקְצַ֥ר רוּחִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “then my breath may certainly be short!”
21:4	j632		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַ֝דּ֗וּעַ לֹא־תִקְצַ֥ר רוּחִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using his **breath** being **short** (that is, the fact that he is breathing quickly) by association to mean him being upset. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “why may I not be upset” or, as a statement, “then I may certainly be upset!”
21:5	j633		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	פְּנוּ & וְ⁠שִׂ֖ימוּ	1	The implied “you” in the imperatives **Look** and **lay** is plural because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
21:5	j634		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠שִׂ֖ימוּ יָ֣ד עַל־פֶּֽה	1	Since Job is speaking to three people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural forms of **hand** and **mouth**. Alternate translation: “and lay your hands upon your mouths”
21:5	lu7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠שִׂ֖ימוּ יָ֣ד עַל־פֶּֽה	1	Covering the **mouth** with the **hand** prevents a person from speaking. Job is suggesting that his three friends perform this symbolic action to indicate that his situation is so tragic and distressing that nothing can be said about it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and lay your hands upon your mouths to show that my situation is so tragic and distressing that nothing can be said about it”
21:6	j635		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זָכַ֥רְתִּי	1	Job is referring implicitly to when he remembers or is mindful of his sufferings. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I think about my sufferings”
21:6	j636		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִבְהָ֑לְתִּי	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “then that terrifies me”
21:6	f8uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠אָחַ֥ז בְּ֝שָׂרִ֗⁠י פַּלָּצֽוּת	1	Job is speaking of **trembling** as if it were a living thing that could seize his **flesh**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my flesh trembles”
21:6	suz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אָחַ֥ז בְּ֝שָׂרִ֗⁠י פַּלָּצֽוּת	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean his whole body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my whole body trembles”
21:7	i446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַדּ֣וּעַ רְשָׁעִ֣ים יִחְי֑וּ עָ֝תְק֗וּ גַּם־גָּ֥בְרוּ חָֽיִל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The wicked should not live, grow old, and become mighty in power!”
21:7	j637		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here, as in several other places in the chapter, Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
21:8	w7je		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	זַרְעָ֤⁠ם נָכ֣וֹן	1	Here, **seed** means “children.” Alternate translation: “Their children are established”
21:8	j638		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	זַרְעָ֤⁠ם נָכ֣וֹן	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Their children grow up”
21:8	j639		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֣ם	1	Here the word **faces** represents the presence of people by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “in their presence” or “in their homes”
21:8	n4np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠צֶאֱצָאֵי⁠הֶ֗ם לְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and their descendants in their sight” or “and their descendants where they can see them”
21:8	j640		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ֝⁠צֶאֱצָאֵי⁠הֶ֗ם לְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and their descendants grow up where they can see them”
21:9	j641		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בָּתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם שָׁל֣וֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. In this instance, Job is using an abstract noun with the sense of an adjective. Alternate translation: “Their houses are peaceful”
21:9	e8z5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בָּתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם	1	Job could be using the term **houses** by association to mean the households of wicked people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Their households”
21:9	u9sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹ֤א שֵׁ֖בֶט אֱל֣וֹהַּ עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is using the term **rod** by association to mean punishment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as in UST: “and God does not punish them”
21:10	za7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	שׁוֹר֣⁠וֹ עִ֭בַּר וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַגְעִ֑ל תְּפַלֵּ֥ט פָּ֝רָת֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א תְשַׁכֵּֽל	1	Although Job uses singular pronouns in this verse, he is not referring to a specific wicked person. He is still speaking of wicked people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express his meaning by using plural pronouns. Alternate translation: “Their bulls breed and they do not fail; their cows calve and they do not miscarry”
21:11	f9ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יְשַׁלְּח֣וּ כַ֭⁠צֹּאן עֲוִילֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The point of this comparison is that just as shepherds send their flocks out to pasture, so the wicked people whom Job is describing send their young children out to play in the fields around their homes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “They send their young children out to play in the fields around their homes as if they were a flock of sheep going out to pasture”
21:11	j642		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְשַׁלְּח֣וּ & עֲוִילֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The implication is that wicked people can **send** their **babes** (young children) out to play because they are safe, as Job says in verse 9. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Because they are so safe, they can allow their young children to play outside”
21:11	j643		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠יַלְדֵי⁠הֶ֗ם יְרַקֵּדֽוּ⁠ן	1	The implication is that the **children** of wicked people **dance** because they are happy and carefree. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and their children dance because they are happy and carefree”
21:12	j644		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִ֭שְׂאוּ כְּ⁠תֹ֣ף וְ⁠כִנּ֑וֹר	1	The implication is that the children **lift up** these musical instruments in order to play them. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “They play the tambourine and the harp” or “They play tambourines and harps”
21:12	elg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִ֭שְׂאוּ & וְ֝⁠יִשְׂמְח֗וּ	1	In this verse, the pronouns **They** and **they** refer to the children of wicked people, not to wicked people themselves. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Their children lift up … and those children rejoice”
21:12	w5nf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	כְּ⁠תֹ֣ף וְ⁠כִנּ֑וֹר & עוּגָֽב	1	Job is not referring to a specific **tambourine** or **harp** or **flute**. He means those musical instruments in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “tambourines and harps … flutes”
21:13	s7tf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יְמֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Job is using the term **days** to mean a specific period of time, the lifetime of wicked people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “their lifetime”
21:13	bx7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠בְ⁠רֶ֗גַע	1	The implication is that wicked people do not die a painful, lingering death. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “quickly and painlessly”
21:14	j645		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ לָ֭⁠אֵל ס֣וּר מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ וְ⁠דַ֥עַת דְּ֝רָכֶ֗י⁠ךָ לֹ֣א חָפָֽצְנוּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “They tell God to turn away from them because they do not desire knowledge of his ways”
21:14	j646		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ס֣וּר מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The wicked people are speaking as if they wanted God literally to **turn away** from them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do not be concerned with us”
21:14	j647		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠דַ֥עַת דְּ֝רָכֶ֗י⁠ךָ לֹ֣א חָפָֽצְנוּ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for we do not want to know your ways”
21:14	fm9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דְּ֝רָכֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	The wicked people are speaking of how God wants people to live as if that were a series of **ways** or paths that God wanted people to walk along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “how you want people to live”
21:15	j648		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מַה־שַׁדַּ֥י כִּֽי־נַֽעַבְדֶ֑⁠נּוּ וּ⁠מַה־נּ֝וֹעִ֗יל כִּ֣י נִפְגַּע־בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could continue to translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “They ask who the Almighty is, that they should serve him, and how they would profit, that they should pray to him”
21:15	j649		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מַה־שַׁדַּ֥י כִּֽי־נַֽעַבְדֶ֑⁠נּוּ וּ⁠מַה־נּ֝וֹעִ֗יל כִּ֣י נִפְגַּע־בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is continuing to quote what wicked people say. The wicked people may no longer be speaking “to God,” as in the previous verse, but speaking about God. Alternatively, they may be speaking to God but using the third person. You might choose to translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “Who are you, the Almighty, that we should serve you? And how will we profit, that we should pray to you?”
21:15	k5g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־שַׁדַּ֥י כִּֽי־נַֽעַבְדֶ֑⁠נּוּ וּ⁠מַה־נּ֝וֹעִ֗יל כִּ֣י נִפְגַּע־בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	The wicked people are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “The Almighty is not important, so we do not have to serve him! It would not benefit us, so we do not have to pray to him!”
21:16	ke4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	הֵ֤ן לֹ֣א בְ⁠יָדָ֣⁠ם טוּבָ֑⁠ם עֲצַ֥ת רְ֝שָׁעִ֗ים רָ֣חֲקָה מֶֽ⁠נִּי	1	Job is making two statements in this verse that express strong feelings. In the previous verse, he described how wicked people say that they do not need to pray to God because that would not benefit them. In his first statement here, he insists in response that any benefit or **prosperity** that the wicked enjoy is something that God has generously given to them even though they do not deserve it. In his second statement, Job reacts strongly against the **counsel** or advice that he said wicked people give themselves, that they should not serve the Almighty or pray to him. The ULT places exclamation marks at the end of these sentences to show that they communicate strong emotion. In your translation, use your own language’s way of showing that.
21:16	t984		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹ֣א בְ⁠יָדָ֣⁠ם	1	Job is using the word **hand** to represent the power and control that people have over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is not of their own making” or “is not something that they have gained by themselves”
21:16	j650		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עֲצַ֥ת רְ֝שָׁעִ֗ים רָ֣חֲקָה מֶֽ⁠נִּי	1	Job is speaking as if he wanted the **counsel of the wicked** literally to be **far** away from him.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “The lamp of the wicked does not often go out! No, their calamity does not come upon them often! God does not distribute pains to them in his anger!”
21:17	c9nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּ⁠מָּ֤ה ׀ נֵר־רְשָׁ֘עִ֤ים יִדְעָ֗ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if wicked people literally had a **lamp** that might **go out** or stop burning. He is using this image to represent them dying. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How often do the wicked die”
21:17	g7cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יָבֹ֣א עָלֵ֣י⁠מוֹ אֵידָ֑⁠ם	1	Job is speaking as if **calamity** were literally an object that **comes upon** people.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this in plain language. Alternate translation: “How often does God destroy them quickly and completely in punishment for their sins” or, as a statement, “God does not often destroy them quickly and completely in punishment for their sins”
21:18	j652		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵי־ר֑וּחַ	1	Here the phrase **to the face of** means “in the presence of,” by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present.

21:19	ev9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱל֗וֹהַּ יִצְפֹּן־לְ⁠בָנָ֥י⁠ו אוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	This saying speaks of **guilt** as something that can be stored for later use. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God remembers what he is guilty of doing and punishes his sons for it”
21:19	j653		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לְ⁠בָנָ֥י⁠ו	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that includes both male and female children.

21:21	j656		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֤י	1	Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said in the previous two verses that God should punish wicked people themselves rather than their children.

21:21	j657		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠בֵית֣⁠וֹ	1	Job is most likely using the term **house** by association to mean the household or family of a wicked person. The popular saying that he quoted in verse 19 suggested that God would punish a wicked person by making his children suffer, but Job is saying here that after a wicked person dies, he will not care about that.

Alternate translation: “No one can teach knowledge to God, since he judges the ones being high!”
21:22	x9p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רָמִ֥ים	1	Job is probably using the term **high** by association to mean angels, who are high in heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “even the angels”
21:23	j658		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	זֶ֗ה	1	The pronoun **This** does not refer to a specific person. Job is using it to describe one kind of person and to introduce a contrast with a different kind of person, whom he describes as “That one” in verse 25.

21:23	krv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠עֶ֣צֶם תֻּמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	In this expression, the word **bone** indicates the essence of something. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “at the height of his perfection”

21:23	j661		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כֻּ֝לּ֗⁠וֹ שַׁלְאֲנַ֥ן וְ⁠שָׁלֵֽיו	1	The terms **tranquil** and **secure** mean similar things. Job may be using the two terms together for emphasis. However, there is a slight difference between them. The word **tranquil** refers more to a person not having to worry about threats, while the word **secure** refers more to a person being wealthy. You could express both words with a single phrase that would communicate emphasis, or you could use two words to bring out the different shades of meaning. Alternate translation: “he is very comfortable” or “he is so wealthy that he does not worry”
21:24	mli3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֲ֭טִינָי⁠ו מָלְא֣וּ חָלָ֑ב	1	Interpreters are not entirely sure of the meaning of the word translated as **pails**. One likely interpretation is that it describes pails that people would use to collect milk from their cattle. If that is the meaning, then Job is using one aspect of this person’s prosperity, the fact that his cattle give milk abundantly, to indicate that the person is prosperous in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His cattle give milk abundantly” or “He is very prosperous”
21:24	uug7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וּ⁠מֹ֖חַ עַצְמוֹתָ֣י⁠ו יְשֻׁקֶּֽה	1	Job is using one aspect of this person’s health, the fact that the **marrow of his bones** is healthy, to indicate that the person is healthy in general.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he has not experienced the good”
21:25	xpm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠לֹֽא־אָ֝כַ֗ל בַּ⁠טּוֹבָֽה	1	Job is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing.

Alternate translation: “and he has not experienced good things” or “and he has not enjoyed good things”
21:26	fc95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יַ֭חַד עַל־עָפָ֣ר יִשְׁכָּ֑בוּ	1	Job is using the phrase **lie down … in the dust** to mean “die.” This is a poetic way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “They both die and are buried”
21:26	j663		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠רִמָּ֗ה תְּכַסֶּ֥ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is not referring to a specific **worm**. He means worms in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “and worms cover them both”
21:26	tyf2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠רִמָּ֗ה תְּכַסֶּ֥ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The implication of worms covering the bodies of these dead people is that the worms are eating their bodies. For clarity, you could indicate that in your. Alternate translation: “and worms eat their bodies”
21:27	veu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָ֭דַעְתִּי מַחְשְׁבֽוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֑ם וּ֝⁠מְזִמּ֗וֹת	1	Job implicitly means that he knows his friends are thinking of him when they speak of a wicked person.

Alternate translation: “I know that when you speak of a wicked person, you are speaking of me, and I know the notions”
21:27	j664		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מַחְשְׁבֽוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֑ם & תַּחְמֹֽסוּ	1	The words **your** and **you** are plural here because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. The words “you” and “your” are plural in the rest of the chapter as well, specifically in verses 29 and 34.
21:27	jy5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מְזִמּ֗וֹת עָלַ֥⁠י תַּחְמֹֽסוּ	1	Job is speaking as if his friends would literally **wrest**, or yank violently out of place, **notions** or ideas to use against him.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as exclamations: “The tyrant no longer lives among us! The wicked no longer live among us!”

21:28	j668		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אַיֵּ֥ה בֵית־נָדִ֑יב	1	Job is not referring to a specific **tyrant**. He means tyrants in general.

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Since Job is speaking of more than one person, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of “tent.” Alternate translation: “Where are the tents in which wicked people lived?” or “Wicked people no longer live among us!” or “God punishes wicked people by killing them!”
21:28	j669		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֹ֤הֶל ׀ מִשְׁכְּנ֬וֹת רְשָׁעִֽים	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **habitation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the tent in which the wicked lived”

You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You must have asked travelers of the way, and they must have told you what really happens to wicked people!”
21:29	j671		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ע֣וֹבְרֵי דָ֑רֶךְ	1	Job is not referring to a specific **way**, that is, to a specific road or route. He means roads in general.

21:29	j672		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ֝⁠אֹתֹתָ֗⁠ם לֹ֣א תְנַכֵּֽרוּ	1	This is the beginning of a sentence in which Job is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “You should acknowledge their signs”
21:29	j673		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠אֹתֹתָ֗⁠ם	1	Job is using the word **signs** in a specific sense. He means proofs or tokens that something is true. He is probably referring to stories that travelers tell of wicked people whom they have seen or heard about. These stories, in Job’s opinion, would offer evidence that he is right and his friends are wrong about what happens to wicked people. (Job describes the content of these stories in the next verse.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or … the truth of the stories they tell about wicked people”

If in the previous verse you said something such as “You should acknowledge their signs,” you may be able to translate this much as it appears in the ULT, treating it as the continuation of a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “that the wicked is spared in the day of calamity, that in the day of wrath they are brought forth.”
21:30	wy2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יֵחָ֣שֶׂךְ רָ֑ע	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God spares the wicked”

21:30	j677		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יוּבָֽלוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The idea is that wicked people are **brought forth** from, that is, taken out of, the group of people whom God is punishing. Alternate translation: “God brings them forth” or “God does not punish them”

21:31	ri98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his manner of life”

21:32	j678		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ֭⁠הוּא לִ⁠קְבָר֣וֹת יוּבָ֑ל	1	The word that the ULT translates as **brought forth** here is the same word that it translates as “brought forth” in verse 30. Job is saying that a wicked person is not only spared from God’s punishment, he is buried with honor in a great procession (which Job describes further in the next verse). Your language may similarly have a term that you could use in both contexts to show the contrast that Job is drawing here between what a wicked person deserves and what he gets.

Alternate translation: “his honorable burial site”
21:33	eqt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רִגְבֵ֫י נָ֥חַל	1	Job is using the phrase **The clods of the torrent** by association to mean the burial mound that the wicked person’s mourners build up over his grave. He is using the word **torrent** to mean the course that a torrent or stream flows through, from which people could take **clods** of dirt to build a mound. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His burial mound”
21:33	j681		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מָֽתְקוּ־ל֗⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if the wicked person, even after death, could literally taste his burial mound and find it to be **sweet**. Job means that the wicked person would enjoy being honored with a burial mound. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will honor him”
21:33	p9wd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־אָדָ֣ם	1	Job says **every** here as a generalization for emphasis. He means that a procession consisting of a large number of people will follow the wicked person’s body to its grave. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “a long procession”
21:33	j682		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ֝⁠לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	In this context, the phrase **to his face** means “in front of him” or “ahead of him.” It is a further reference to the funeral procession for the wicked person. Alternate translation: “and ahead of him”
21:33	j683		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	אֵ֣ין מִסְפָּֽר	1	As a generalization for emphasis, Job is saying that a number of people too great to count will walk in front of the wicked person’s body to lead it in an honorary procession to his grave. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “people in great numbers are also walking”
21:34	j6yy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ֭⁠אֵיךְ תְּנַחֲמ֣וּ⁠נִי הָ֑בֶל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are comforting me in vain!”
21:34	aa8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ֝⁠תְשֽׁוּבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֗ם נִשְׁאַר־מָֽעַל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Job is saying that once he disregards everything that seems to be present in his friends’ **answers** but is not actually present, falsehood is the only thing that will remain. Alternate translation: “And your answers are nothing but falsehood”
21:34	j684		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠תְשֽׁוּבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֗ם נִשְׁאַר־מָֽעַל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **falsehood**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “And what you are saying in answer to me is entirely false”
22:intro	m13v				0	# Job 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the third and last speech of Job’s friend Eliphaz. What he says in this speech is stronger than what he says in his previous two speeches. He insists that Job must have done wrong, and he suggests several specific evil things that Job may have done.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Eliphaz answering Job with his own words\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Eliphaz answers Job with his own words. That is, Eliphaz uses the same expressions that Job did earlier, but with different meaning and implications. To help your readers appreciate this, you may wish to translate Eliphaz’s expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier. Notes will suggest ways to do this.
22:2	r9kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠לְ⁠אֵ֥ל יִסְכָּן־גָּ֑בֶר	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “A man cannot be useful to God!”
22:2	j685		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	גָּ֑בֶר	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
22:3	h3pe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠חֵ֣פֶץ לְ֭⁠שַׁדַּי כִּ֣י תִצְדָּ֑ק וְ⁠אִם־בֶּ֝֗צַע כִּֽי־תַתֵּ֥ם דְּרָכֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “It is not pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous! It is not gain to him that you perfect your ways!”
22:3	j686		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־בֶּ֝֗צַע כִּֽי־תַתֵּ֥ם דְּרָכֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Eliphaz is using the word **if** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “it is not gain to him that you perfect your ways, is it”
22:3	j687		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דְּרָכֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Job is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a series of **ways** or paths that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your manner of life”
22:4	s9qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲֽ֭⁠מִ⁠יִּרְאָ֣תְ⁠ךָ יֹכִיחֶ֑⁠ךָ יָב֥וֹא עִ֝מְּ⁠ךָ֗ בַּ⁠מִּשְׁפָּֽט	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “God is certainly not rebuking you and entering into judgment with you because of your reverent respect for him!”
22:4	g1nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲֽ֭⁠מִ⁠יִּרְאָ֣תְ⁠ךָ	1	By **fear**, Eliphaz implicitly means the fear of God, that is, reverent respect for God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “For your reverent respect for him”
22:5	zd3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֣א רָעָֽתְ⁠ךָ֣ רַבָּ֑ה	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Your wickedness is great!”
22:5	j688		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠אֵֽין־קֵ֝֗ץ לַ⁠עֲוֺנֹתֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Eliphaz says **no end** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “And you are guilty of very many iniquities”
22:6	z1dn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is not saying that Job has definitely done the wrongs that he describes in this verse and the next three verses. He is using the word **For** to encourage Job to consider what he might have done wrong, since God seems to be punishing him for something. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Perhaps” or “Consider whether”
22:6	hip2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תַחְבֹּ֣ל אַחֶ֣י⁠ךָ חִנָּ֑ם	1	By **without cause**, Eliphaz probably means that Job did not need to take a garment in pledge as security for the kind of small loan that a laborer in this culture would require. Job was a wealthy man, Eliphaz notes in verse 8, and he could afford a relatively small loss, while the outer garment the laborer would have to give in pledge (described in the second half of the verse) probably represented his most valuable possession. Eliphaz may also be suggesting that the laborer was trustworthy and Job could have and should have trusted him to repay the loan without demanding security. Your culture may have terms and customs relating to loans and pledges that you could use in your translation to bring out the implicit meaning here. Alternate translation: “you have forced your brother to give you his outer garment as security for a loan, even though you did not need to do that”
22:6	j689		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַחֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	Eliphaz is using the term **brother** figuratively to mean a fellow human being. He is suggesting that Job should feel an affinity for any fellow human. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your fellow human being”
22:6	qq5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בִגְדֵ֖י עֲרוּמִּ֣ים תַּפְשִֽׁיט	1	The word translated **naked** can describe people who have little clothing, and that seems to be the meaning here. It would not make sense to speak of the **clothing** of people who were **naked** in the sense of having no clothing. The idea seems to be that by taking in pledge an outer garment that a laborer would also use as a blanket at night, Job was leaving that person without enough clothing to stay warm. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “indeed, you have left that person without enough clothing to stay warm”
22:7	j690		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עָיֵ֣ף & וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠רָעֵ֗ב	1	Eliphaz is using the adjectives **weary** and **hungry** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “weary people … and from hungry people”
22:7	q9nb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לָֽחֶם	1	Eliphaz is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “food”
22:8	j691		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠אִ֣ישׁ זְ֭רוֹעַ ל֣⁠וֹ הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ וּ⁠נְשׂ֥וּא פָ֝נִ֗ים יֵ֣שֶׁב בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	Eliphaz could mean: (1) that Job himself was this **man of arm**. In that case he would be speaking of Job in the third person, even though he was speaking directly to Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “even though, as a man of arm, the earth was to you, and you dwelt upon it as someone lifted of face” (2) that Job showed favoritism to powerful and honored people. Alternate translation: “but you decided in favor of the man of arm and the lifted of face, so that the earth was to them and they dwelt upon it”
22:8	dj3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִ֣ישׁ זְ֭רוֹעַ ל֣⁠וֹ הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	The expression **the man of arm** means a powerful person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but the powerful person, the earth was to him” or “but as a powerful person, the earth was to you”
22:8	gry9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ל֣⁠וֹ הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if this **man of arm** possessed the entire **earth**. He likely means that this person (possibly Job) owned much land. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “he owned much land”
22:8	ti2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠נְשׂ֥וּא פָ֝נִ֗ים יֵ֣שֶׁב	1	The expression **lifted of face** means to be favored or honored. (See the discussion of the phrase “lift his face” in the General Notes to chapter 13.) Alternate translation: “and honored people dwelt” or “and you as an honored person dwelt”
22:8	u5gg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠נְשׂ֥וּא פָ֝נִ֗ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and people who received honors”
22:9	kyr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠זְרֹע֖וֹת יְתֹמִ֣ים יְדֻכָּֽא	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and you have broken the arms of the fatherless”
22:9	j692		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וּ⁠זְרֹע֖וֹת יְתֹמִ֣ים יְדֻכָּֽא	1	Job is using the adjective **fatherless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent word or phrase. Alternate translation: “and you have broken the arms of orphans”
22:9	pdd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠זְרֹע֖וֹת יְתֹמִ֣ים יְדֻכָּֽא	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job had literally **broken** the **arms** of **fatherless** people. He means that Job has not helped orphans but has treated them in a way that has made them even weaker and more destitute. (As in the previous verse, the arm is a symbol of power.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you have taken advantage of orphans” or “and you have exploited orphans”
22:10	wdg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	סְבִיבוֹתֶ֣י⁠ךָ פַחִ֑ים	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if **snares** or traps were literally surrounding Job. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are having many different kinds of trouble”
22:10	j693		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וִֽ֝⁠יבַהֶלְ⁠ךָ פַּ֣חַד פִּתְאֹֽם	1	Eliphaz is using the term **fear** by association to mean things that cause fear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and fearful things suddenly terrify you”
22:11	j694		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אוֹ־חֹ֥שֶׁךְ לֹֽא־תִרְאֶ֑ה	1	Eliphaz is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And that is why you are in darkness and cannot see”
22:11	kz5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אוֹ־חֹ֥שֶׁךְ לֹֽא־תִרְאֶ֑ה	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job were literally in **darkness** and could not **see** anything. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And that is why your troubles are so great that you do not know what to do about them”
22:11	a6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְֽ⁠שִׁפְעַת־מַ֥יִם תְּכַסֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job were literally engulfed in deep **waters**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, that is why you feel completely overwhelmed”
22:12	st8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲֽ⁠לֹא־אֱ֭לוֹהַּ גֹּ֣בַהּ שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “God is in the height of the heavens!”
22:12	n1zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	גֹּ֣בַהּ שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	Eliphaz is using this possessive form to describe the highest part of the **heavens**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “in the highest heaven” or “in heaven, above the sky”
22:12	rtk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠רְאֵ֤ה רֹ֖אשׁ כּוֹכָבִ֣ים כִּי־רָֽמּוּ	1	In this context, the word **head** means “height.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And behold how high the stars are”
22:12	j695		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠רְאֵ֤ה רֹ֖אשׁ כּוֹכָבִ֣ים כִּי־רָֽמּוּ	1	The implication is that since God is above the stars, and the stars are very high up, the highest things that people can see, then God must be supremely high. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God is even above the stars, even though those are the highest things that we can see”
22:13	j696		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְֽ֭⁠אָמַרְתָּ מַה־יָּ֣דַֽע אֵ֑ל הַ⁠בְעַ֖ד עֲרָפֶ֣ל יִשְׁפּֽוֹט	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But you say that God does not know what is happening here on earth and that he cannot judge through thick darkness”
22:13	y6zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־יָּ֣דַֽע אֵ֑ל הַ⁠בְעַ֖ד עֲרָפֶ֣ל יִשְׁפּֽוֹט	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “God does not know what is happening here on earth! He cannot judge through thick darkness!”
22:13	j697		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠בְעַ֖ד עֲרָפֶ֣ל יִשְׁפּֽוֹט	1	As is clear from the next verse, Eliphaz is using the expression **thick darkness** by association to mean dark clouds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as a statement: “He cannot see through dark clouds in order to know how to judge people!”
22:14	j698		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	עָבִ֣ים סֵֽתֶר־ל֭⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִרְאֶ֑ה וְ⁠ח֥וּג שָׁ֝מַ֗יִם יִתְהַלָּֽךְ	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation as an indirect quotation, you can continue to do that in this verse. In many languages it will not be necessary to change the wording from that of a direct quotation.
22:14	j699		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִרְאֶ֑ה	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that by saying this, Job means that God does not **see** what is happening on earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and he does not see what is happening on earth”
22:14	x5ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠ח֥וּג שָׁ֝מַ֗יִם יִתְהַלָּֽךְ	1	The implication is that because the **dome of the heavens** is above the clouds, the clouds block God’s view of the earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “indeed, he walks around on the dome of the heavens, where the clouds block his view of the earth”
22:15	cvp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠אֹ֣רַח עוֹלָ֣ם תִּשְׁמֹ֑ר אֲשֶׁ֖ר דָּרְכ֣וּ מְתֵי־אָֽוֶן	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis.

22:15	j700		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠אֹ֣רַח עוֹלָ֣ם תִּשְׁמֹ֑ר אֲשֶׁ֖ר דָּרְכ֣וּ מְתֵי־אָֽוֶן	1	Eliphaz is speaking of how people live as if that were a **way** or path that people were walking along. When Eliphaz asks whether Job will **keep** that way or stay on that path, he is asking whether Job really wants to live that way himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Will you live as men of iniquity have customarily lived” or, as a statement, “You should not live as men of iniquity have customarily lived”
22:15	j701		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מְתֵי־אָֽוֶן	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **iniquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
22:16	j702		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲשֶֽׁר־קֻמְּט֥וּ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if these “men of iniquity” were literally **carried off** as if they were a bundle of sticks that someone had collected. He means that they died. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who died”
22:16	j703		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲשֶֽׁר־קֻמְּט֥וּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom death carried off”
22:16	j704		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹא־עֵ֑ת	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that these wicked men died before it was their **time** to die.

22:16	j705		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נָ֝הָ֗ר יוּצַ֥ק יְסוֹדָֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “a torrent washed away their foundations”

The suggestion in the image is that the men died unexpectedly and violently. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, they died unexpectedly and violently”
22:17	j706		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	הָ⁠אֹמְרִ֣ים לָ֭⁠אֵל ס֣וּר מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ וּ⁠מַה־יִּפְעַ֖ל שַׁדַּ֣י לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “the ones who told God to turn away from them and asked what the Almighty would do to them”
22:17	j707		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ס֣וּר מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Eliphaz depicts these wicked people as speaking as if they wanted God literally to **turn away** from them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the same expression in [21:14](../21/14.md). Alternate translation: “Do not be concerned with us”
22:17	j708		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וּ⁠מַה־יִּפְעַ֖ל שַׁדַּ֣י לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	The wicked people are speaking about themselves in the third person.

22:18	jh2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֤וּא מִלֵּ֣א בָתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם ט֑וֹב	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God. Eliphaz is echoing what Job said about wicked people in [21:16](../21/16.md), “their prosperity is not in their hand,” that is, their prosperity is not of their own making. Eliphaz is saying, as Job did, that any **good** the wicked enjoy is something that God has generously given to them even though they do not deserve it. Eliphaz is agreeing with Job on that point, although he is making it in support of a different conclusion, that in the end, God actually does punish the wicked in this life. Alternate translation: “Yet God filled their houses with good”
22:18	nr68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠ה֤וּא מִלֵּ֣א בָתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם ט֑וֹב	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Yet he filled their houses with good things”
22:18	j710		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠ה֤וּא מִלֵּ֣א בָתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם ט֑וֹב	1	Eliphaz says **filled** here as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “Yet he generously gave them many good things”
22:18	l57x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠עֲצַ֥ת רְ֝שָׁעִ֗ים רָ֣חֲקָה מֶֽ⁠נִּי	1	Eliphaz is echoing what Job said in [21:16](../21/16.md). He is speaking as if he wanted the **counsel of the wicked** literally to be **far** away from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression in [21:16](../21/16.md). Alternate translation: “so I want nothing to do with the counsel of the wicked”
22:19	ku9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִרְא֣וּ צַדִּיקִ֣ים	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that the righteous **see** what happens to wicked people. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The righteous see what happens to wicked people”
22:19	q2jl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	צַדִּיקִ֣ים & וְ֝⁠נָקִ֗י	1	Eliphaz is using the adjectives **righteous** and **innocent** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Righteous people … and innocent people”

It may be more natural in your language to make the pronoun agree in number. Since Eliphaz speaks of wicked people in the plural in these verses, you may find it appropriate to do that by saying “enemies.” Alternate translation: “If our enemies are not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions”
22:20	j711		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	אִם־לֹ֣א נִכְחַ֣ד קִימָ֑⁠נוּ וְ֝⁠יִתְרָ֗⁠ם אָ֣כְלָה אֵֽשׁ	1	Eliphaz is quoting what righteous and innocent people say about wicked people whom God destroys. If that would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “They say, ‘If our enemies are not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions!’”
22:20	j712		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אִם־לֹ֣א נִכְחַ֣ד קִימָ֑⁠נוּ וְ֝⁠יִתְרָ֗⁠ם אָ֣כְלָה אֵֽשׁ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “They say that their enemies have been cut off and that fire has devoured their possessions”
22:20	j713		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־לֹ֣א נִכְחַ֣ד קִימָ֑⁠נוּ	1	The righteous and innocent people are using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Our enemies have been cut off, have they not”
22:20	j714		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־לֹ֣א נִכְחַ֣ד קִימָ֑⁠נוּ	1	The righteous and innocent people are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Our enemies have been cut off!”
22:20	jwg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אִם־לֹ֣א נִכְחַ֣ד קִימָ֑⁠נוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has cut off our enemies!”
22:20	j715		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־לֹ֣א נִכְחַ֣ד קִימָ֑⁠נוּ	1	To make a different point, that God actually judges wicked people in this life, Eliphaz is echoing what Job said in [21:21](../21/21..md). There Job spoke of a wicked person dying as if he were literally being **cut off**, like a branch from a tree. See how you translated the similar expression there. Alternate translation: “God has ended the lives of our enemies!”
22:20	j716		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠יִתְרָ֗⁠ם אָ֣כְלָה אֵֽשׁ	1	Eliphaz depicts innocent and righteous people as speaking as if **fire** had destroyed the **possessions** of wicked people. Eliphaz depicts them as speaking as if the fire had literally **devoured** or eaten the possessions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And they have lost their possessions” or “And other people will now get their possessions”
22:21	aj2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַסְכֶּן־נָ֣א עִמּ֑⁠וֹ וּ⁠שְׁלם	1	Eliphaz is echoing his own words at the beginning of this speech and Job’s words in his preceding speech. In verse 2, Eliphaz insisted that a person cannot be “useful to God,” that is, a person can do nothing to win God’s favor or to put God under obligation. Here Eliphaz uses a different form of the same verb to encourage Job to **Reconcile** with God. A person, he says, can at least cultivate a good relationship with God. Job said in [21:19](../21/19.md) that he wished God would “repay” wicked people, that is, punish them. Eliphaz uses the same verb here to encourage Job to be **at peace** with God, with the suggestion that to that end, Job should do whatever is necessary to make up for any wrong things he has done. Your language may have terms that you could use here and in [21:19](../21/19.md) and [22:2](../22/02.md) in order to show these connections.
22:21	z6jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠שְׁלם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and have a peaceful relationship with him”

22:23	j720		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּבָּנֶ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will build you up”

He means that Job should not depend on gold as a source of security. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

Here Eliphaz responds that Job will no longer need to do that. See how you translated the similar expression in [10:15](../10/15.md). Alternate translation: “and you will no longer need to look down, away from God, in shame” or “and you will be confident that God accepts you”
22:27	j726		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִשְׁמָעֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	In this context, the word **hear** means to grant a request. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he will grant your request”

The implication is that God would grant such mercies to Job and so he would have occasion to **pay** such **vows**. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you will have occasion to thank God publicly for mercies that he has granted to you”

23:intro	fb42				0	# Job 23 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s third and final speech. Job’s response continues in the next chapter.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Legal proceeding\n\nIn this chapter, Job speaks of making a legal case to prove his innocence to God. As a note to [9:3](../09/03.md) explains, in this culture, people typically presented such cases to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party in a dispute would question the other party in the presence of the leaders, and the leaders would then discuss the case and decide which party was guilty and which party was innocent. However, the Bible indicates that judges would also travel around from place to place and hear cases. For example, [1 Samuel 7:16–17](../1sa/07/16.md) says that Samuel “went around to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah and judged Israel in all those places.” Job is envisioning God serving as this kind of judge and hearing his case. In your translation, express his language in such a way that readers who are familiar with the legal process in your own culture will recognize what Job is saying.\n\n## Translation issues in This chapter\n\n### “he,” “him,” and “his”\n\nThe pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” refer to God throughout this chapter. The UST models how a translation may say “God” regularly in order to make this clear.\n\n### “my hand” or “his hand” (23:2)\n\nIn verse 2, Hebrew manuscripts read “my hand.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible into other languages say “his hand,” and some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the readingof the ULT.
23:2	fi9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גַּם־הַ֭⁠יּוֹם	1	Job is using this expression to emphasize to his friends that their arguments have not changed his situation at all.

He is speaking of looking everywhere for the “place” where God lives, as he described in verse 3. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 8–9. It might say something like this: “Behold, I could go everywhere in creation, and I might see evidence of God at work, but I would not find him personally”

23:10	v4c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	בְּ֝חָנַ֗⁠נִי כַּ⁠זָּהָ֥ב אֵצֵֽא	1	The point of this comparison is that just as genuine **gold** is shown to be pure when it is **tested**, so God giving Job a hearing would show that he is innocent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he tests me, this will show that I am innocent, just as testing gold shows its purity”

23:13	j742		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠ה֣וּא בְ֭⁠אֶחָד	1	Job is leaving out a word that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. The context suggests that Job means that God **is of one** opinion, that is, he has decided one thing definitively. If it would be clearer in your language, you can supply the missing word. Your language may have a natural expression that would suit this context. Alternate translation: “But he is of one mind”

23:14	g641		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	חֻקִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe what God has decreed for him, not a **decree** that he has made himself.

23:17	j744		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he is terrified of God, as he described in the previous two verses.

24:intro	e2gb				0	# Job 24 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the continuation of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s third and final speech. Job’s response began in the previous chapter.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### God’s judgment of wicked people\n\nIn verses 1–17, Job protests that God does not judge wicked people. He lists many oppressive things that wicked people do to vulnerable, innocent people, and he complains that God acts as if there were nothing wrong with those things. But in verses 18–24, Job then describes how God actually does judge wicked people. There is an explanation for this apparent contradiction. In the speech as a whole, Job is saying that he knows God will judge wicked people in the end, but it is very distressing to him that God does not judge and punish them now in order to keep them from continuing to oppress vulnerable people. In your translation, you can use language that shows that Job firmly believes what he says in both parts of the chapter, since it is actually consistent for him to say both that God seemingly does not judge wicked people now and that God ultimately will judge wicked people in the end. This is not a contradiction, it is a paradox, and the Bible speaks of it in other passages as well. For example, [Ecclesiastes 8:11](../08/11.md) says that because God does not immediately punish people who do wrong, people feel that they can get away with doing wrong. But Ecclesiastes goes on to say in the next verse that even if a sinner might do a hundred evil things and live a long time, it is still better to obey God.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Changing referents of “they”\n\nJob uses the word “they” throughout this chapter to mean both wicked people and the poor people whom they exploit. He does not often indicate when he changing the referent of the word. Notes indicate the referent in each verse. In your translation, to be helpful to your readers, you may wish to specify “wicked people” or “poor people” each time the referent changes.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Times should be set by the Almighty! The ones knowing him ought to see his days!”
24:1	ej3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מַדּ֗וּעַ מִ֭⁠שַּׁדַּי לֹא־נִצְפְּנ֣וּ עִתִּ֑ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Why does the Almighty not set times” or, as an exclamation, “The Almighty should set times!”
24:1	mg7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עִתִּ֑ים	1	Job implicitly means **times** for judgment.

24:1	j749		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝יֹדְעָ֗יו לֹא־חָ֥זוּ יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	In this context, to **see** means to experience. See how you translated the similar expression in [7:7](../07/07.md). Alternate translation: “And why do the ones knowing him not experience his days?”
24:1	j750		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	Job implicitly means **days** on which God would judge wicked people. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “days on which God judges wicked people”

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. The pronoun **they** in the second part of the verse also refers to wicked people, and that is also the reference in the next two verses. Alternate translation: “Wicked people remove boundary markers”
24:2	pse5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גְּבֻל֥וֹת יַשִּׂ֑יגוּ	1	Job implicitly means that wicked people steal land from others by removing the **boundary markers** that indicate property lines and arguing that their property extends farther into their neighbor’s land than it actually does. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “They steal land from others by removing boundary markers”
24:2	mn98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	עֵ֥דֶר גָּ֝זְל֗וּ וַ⁠יִּרְעֽוּ	1	Job is not referring to a specific **flock**. He means flocks in general that wicked people steal from vulnerable people such as widows and orphans, whom he names specifically in the next verse. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “they seize flocks and pasture them”
24:2	j751		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּרְעֽוּ	1	Job implicitly means that wicked people steal flocks from others and **pasture** them with their own flocks as if they had owned them all along. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and put others’ animals in with their own as if those animals belonged to them”
24:3	fml5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	חֲמ֣וֹר יְתוֹמִ֣ים יִנְהָ֑גוּ יַ֝חְבְּל֗וּ שׁ֣וֹר אַלְמָנָֽה	1	Job is not referring to a specific **donkey**, **fatherless** person, **ox**, or **widow**. He means those animals and people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “Wicked people lead away donkeys that belong to fatherless people; they take in pledge oxen that belong to widows”
24:3	y9i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	יְתוֹמִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **fatherless** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “children whose fathers have died” or “orphans”
24:3	m884		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יַ֝חְבְּל֗וּ	1	See the note to [22:6](../22/06.md) about the cultural practice of taking possessions **in pledge**. See how you translated the similar expression there.
24:4	lzi7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יַטּ֣וּ אֶבְיוֹנִ֣ים מִ⁠דָּ֑רֶךְ	1	This could mean: (1) that needy people avoid walking on the main road or **way** in order to avoid wicked people who would exploit them. In that sense, it is as if the wicked people are actively forcing the needy people off the road. Alternate translation: “Needy people stay off the main roads in order to avoid wicked people” (2) that wicked people push needy people aside on the road so that they can go ahead of them. Alternate translation: “Wicked people push needy people aside on the road so that they can go ahead of them”
24:4	j752		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֶבְיוֹנִ֣ים & עֲנִיֵּי	1	Job is using the adjectives **needy** and **poor** as nouns to mean certain groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “needy people … the poor people of”
24:4	r5d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יַ֥חַד חֻ֝בְּא֗וּ עֲנִיֵּי־אָֽרֶץ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Wicked people are the implied agent. Job is not saying simply that poor people hide themselves to avoid the wicked; he is saying that wicked people force poor people to hide themselves to escape oppression. Alternate translation: “all the poor people of the land have to hide in order to avoid the wicked people who would oppress them”
24:5	m813		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	פְּרָאִ֨ים ׀ בַּֽ⁠מִּדְבָּ֗ר יָצְא֣וּ בְּ֭⁠פָעֳלָ⁠ם	1	The point of this comparison is that the need to escape from oppressive wicked people forces poor people to go far away from human community, **like wild donkeys in the wilderness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “like wild donkeys in the wilderness, far away from human community,”
24:5	d79k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָצְא֣וּ	1	Here and through verse 8, the pronoun **they** refers to poor people. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “poor people go out”
24:5	yaj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ל֥⁠וֹ לֶ֝֗חֶם לַ⁠נְּעָרִֽים	1	The pronoun **him** does not refer to a specific poor person. Job means poor people in general.

24:5	j753		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ל֥⁠וֹ לֶ֝֗חֶם לַ⁠נְּעָרִֽים	1	Job is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general.

If that is the meaning, it may be helpful to mention the wicked person in the first part of the verse instead. Alternate translation: “Poor people gather fodder for their animals from what the wicked person has left in his field, and they glean in his vineyard” (2) an individual poor person. Alternate translation: “Each of these poor people gathers his fodder in the field, and they all glean the vineyard of the wicked”

It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “and the vineyards of wicked people”
24:7	u7w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָר֣וֹם	1	As in [22:6](../22/06.md), the word **naked** here does not mean without any clothing. Rather, as the context indicates, it means without sufficient clothing, in this case **without** an outer **garment** that would also serve as a blanket. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “exposed”
24:7	j756		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠בְּלִ֣י לְב֑וּשׁ	1	The poor people whom Job is talking about may be **without a garment** because: (1) wicked people have taken their outer garments in pledge and not returned them, as Eliphaz describes in [22:6](../22/06.md). This would suit the context, in which Job is describing how wicked people oppress poor people. Alternate translation: “without a garment because wicked people have taken their garments in pledge and not returned them” (2) they are too poor to afford outer garments. Alternate translation: “without outer garments because they have become too poor to afford them”

24:10	eps1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָר֣וֹם הִ֭לְּכוּ בְּלִ֣י לְב֑וּשׁ	1	As in [22:6](../22/06.md), the word **naked** here does not mean without any clothing. Job is describing the result of what he said at the end of the previous verse, that wicked people “bind a pledge” upon the poor, that is, they take their outer garments as security for loans. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Because wicked people take their outer garments in pledge, poor people go about exposed to the elements, not having sufficient clothing”
24:10	j758		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וּ֝⁠רְעֵבִ֗ים נָ֣שְׂאוּ עֹֽמֶר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **sheaf**. He means sheaves in general.

But those poor people still go **hungry**, even with all that food around them, because the wicked people do not pay or feed their workers adequately. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and they are hungry, even though they work as harvesters, because the wicked people who own the fields they are harvesting do not pay or feed them adequately”
24:11	fp3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בֵּין־שׁוּרֹתָ֥⁠ם יַצְהִ֑ירוּ יְקָבִ֥ים דָּ֝רְכ֗וּ וַ⁠יִּצְמָֽאוּ	1	In this verse, the pronoun **they** refers to poor people and the pronoun **their** refers to wicked people.

24:11	rks1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יַצְהִ֑ירוּ	1	Job is referring to the way that workers would **press oil** from olives, which were a staple food in this culture.

24:11	a1m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְקָבִ֥ים דָּ֝רְכ֗וּ וַ⁠יִּצְמָֽאוּ	1	Job is commenting here on the injustice of wicked people having poor people **tread their winepresses** but then not giving them any of the wine to drink. (In this culture, the water was often unsafe to drink. People drank wine to quench their thirst, and, because the wine had a low alcohol content, they could do that without getting drunk. Job is not saying that the wicked people should have given the poor people wine so that they could get drunk, only that they should have given them wine to quench their thirst.) See how you expressed the implicit meaning in the previous verse, where Job described how poor people carried grain but went hungry. Alternate translation: “they are thirsty, even though they work treading winepresses, because the wicked people who own the presses do not give them any of the wine to quench their thirst”
24:12	j759		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	מְתִ֨ים	1	Here the masculine term **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “men and women”
24:12	j760		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠נֶֽפֶשׁ־חֲלָלִ֥ים תְּשַׁוֵּ֑עַ	1	Job is using the adjective **wounded** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and the souls of wounded people cry out”
24:12	j761		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠נֶֽפֶשׁ־חֲלָלִ֥ים תְּשַׁוֵּ֑עַ	1	Job is using one part of a **wounded** person, his **soul**, to mean all of him in the act of crying out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and wounded people cry out”
24:12	j762		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נֶֽפֶשׁ־חֲלָלִ֥ים תְּשַׁוֵּ֑עַ	1	Job implicitly means that these people are crying out to God for justice. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and wounded people cry out to God for justice”
24:12	j763		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וֶ֝⁠אֱל֗וֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׂ֥ים תִּפְלָֽה	1	Job implicitly means that God seems to feel that there is nothing wrong with what the wicked people are doing, and so God does not punish them in response to the poor people’s cries for justice. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but God does not punish the wicked people who have caused their suffering”
24:13	m581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֵ֤מָּה & לֹֽא־הִכִּ֥ירוּ & וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָ֝שְׁב֗וּ	1	The pronoun **They** at the start of the verse and the two instances of the pronoun **they** later in the verse refer to the wicked people whom Job has been describing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “These wicked people … these wicked people … and they do not stay”
24:13	dl4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	א֥וֹר	1	Job is speaking as if **light** were an authority and these wicked people were **rebelling** against it. Job is using light to represent what God has revealed to humans about how they should live. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “against God’s moral revelation”
24:13	djk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹֽא־הִכִּ֥ירוּ דְרָכָ֑י⁠ו וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָ֝שְׁב֗וּ בִּ⁠נְתִיבֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	Job is speaking as if **light** maintained certain **ways** and **paths** that people should walk along. He means that God’s revelation shows people how they should conduct their lives. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they do not regard the manner of life that God has shown people they should follow; no, they live in a different way”
24:13	j764		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־הִכִּ֥ירוּ דְרָכָ֑י⁠ו	1	Here the word **regard** means “look at” with the implication of looking with approval. Alternate translation: “they do not admire its ways”
24:13	j765		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָ֝שְׁב֗וּ בִּ⁠נְתִיבֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “and they leave its paths”
24:14	j766		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לָ⁠א֡וֹר	1	This expression describes the time of day when it is just beginning to get **light**. There is enough light for the **murderer** to see, but not enough light for him to be identified. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “In the morning twilight,”
24:14	j767		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	יָ֘ק֤וּם רוֹצֵ֗חַ יִֽקְטָל & יְהִ֣י כַ⁠גַּנָּֽב	1	Job is not referring to a specific **murderer**. He means murderers in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “murderers arise; they kill … they are like thieves”
24:14	j768		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עָנִ֥י וְ⁠אֶבְי֑וֹן	1	Job is using the adjectives **poor** and **needy** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “poor people and needy people”
24:14	u116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	עָנִ֥י וְ⁠אֶבְי֑וֹן	1	The terms **poor** and **needy** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “desperately poor people”
24:14	d2ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וּ֝⁠בַ⁠לַּ֗יְלָה יְהִ֣י כַ⁠גַּנָּֽב	1	The point of this comparison is that the **murderer** escapes apprehension because he commits his crime in dim light and at a time when people are sleeping. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he is like a thief in the night, whom no one sees commit his crime”
24:15	mza9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עֵ֤ין נֹאֵ֨ף	1	Job is using one part of an **adulterer**, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of watching. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the adulterer”
24:15	jp3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	 נֹאֵ֨ף	1	Job is not referring to a specific **adulterer**. He is describing the behavior that is characteristic of any adulterer. It may be more natural in your language to make **adulterer** an indefinite noun rather than a definite one. Alternate translation: “an adulterer”
24:15	ymp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ֭⁠אמֹר לֹא־תְשׁוּרֵ֣⁠נִי עָ֑יִן	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “saying to himself that no one will perceive him”
24:15	ewy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	 לֹא־תְשׁוּרֵ֣⁠נִי עָ֑יִן	1	The characteristic adulterer is using one part of someone who might **perceive** him, that person’s **eye**, to mean all of that person in the act of perceiving him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “No one will perceive me”
24:15	j769		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠סֵ֖תֶר פָּנִ֣ים יָשִֽׂים	1	Job is not speaking of a **cover** that would keep the **adulterer** from seeing. He is speaking of a disguise intended to keep people from recognizing who the adulterer is. You could express this in a way that would be familiar in your culture. Alternate translation: “and he pulls his hat down low over his face”
24:16	j770		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חָתַ֥ר & בָּ֫תִּ֥ים	1	The pronoun **One** refers to a wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Since, as the rest of the verse shows, Job is actually describing behavior that is characteristic of wicked people in general, you may wish to use a plural term. Alternate translation: “Wicked people dig into houses”
24:16	c35g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חָתַ֥ר בַּ⁠חֹ֗שֶׁךְ בָּ֫תִּ֥ים	1	In this culture, **houses** were made of clay or sun-dried brick, so thieves could gain entry to a house most easily by digging through one of its walls. If houses in your culture are made of different materials that a thief would not or could not dig through, you may wish to use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “Wicked people break into houses”
24:16	k9sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	חִתְּמוּ־לָ֗⁠מוֹ	1	This expression means ”they stay indoors.“ If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they stay indoors”
24:16	j771		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־יָ֥דְעוּ אֽוֹר	1	This expression means that wicked people are not familiar with **light**, and the reason is that they do not leave their homes when it is light. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they do not go out when it is light”
24:16	j772		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹא־יָ֥דְעוּ אֽוֹר	1	While the word **light** here is literal, since Job is using it to mean **day**, there is also a moral overtone, as in verse 13, where Job said that wicked people rebel against the light, meaning God’s revelation. If your language has a term for “light” that also has these moral connotations, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation.
24:17	j773		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֤י יַחְדָּ֨ו בֹּ֣קֶר לָ֣⁠מוֹ	1	Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said in the preceding verse that wicked people do not go out during the day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “They do not go out because for all of them, morning”
24:17	g55x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֹּ֣קֶר לָ֣⁠מוֹ צַלְמָ֑וֶת	1	Job is speaking as if **morning** were literally **deep darkness** for wicked people. He means that they dread and avoid morning just as honest people dread and avoid the night. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they dread the morning as if it were deep darkness”
24:17	j774		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לָ֣⁠מוֹ & יַ֝כִּ֗יר	1	The pronoun **them** refers to wicked people, and the pronoun **one** refers to a representative or characteristic wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “for wicked people … each one of them regards”
24:17	y5ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יַ֝כִּ֗יר	1	As in [24:13](../24/13.md), here the word **regards** means “looks at” with the implication of looking with approval. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “each one of them admires”
24:18	ay3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	קַֽל־ה֤וּא ׀ עַל־פְּנֵי־מַ֗יִם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, at this point in his speech, Job implicitly begins to draw a contrast between the present situation of wicked people and their ultimate fate. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, he is swift”
24:18	lat6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קַֽל־ה֤וּא ׀ עַל־פְּנֵי־מַ֗יִם	1	Job is speaking as if the surface of the **waters** were literally their **face**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He (is} swift on the surface of the waters”
24:18	f772		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	קַֽל־ה֤וּא ׀ עַל־פְּנֵי־מַ֗יִם	1	Job is speaking as if a wicked person were literally something light that would float on the surface of the **waters** of a brook or river and pass swiftly downstream. He means that a wicked person only flourishes for a short time and then is gone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Since Job speaks of wicked people in the plural in the next phrase, you may wish to use the plural in this phrase as well. Alternate translation: “Wicked people flourish only for a short time, then they are gone, like debris that water carries swiftly downstream”
24:18	j775		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־יִ֝פְנֶה דֶּ֣רֶךְ כְּרָמִֽים	1	This expression means that no one goes to work in the **vineyards** of wicked people. Since Job says in verse 13 that poor people do work in their vineyards, he is talking here about what will happen to wicked people in the future. Alternate translation: “their vineyards will be abandoned”
24:19	u6db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	צִיָּ֤ה גַם־חֹ֗ם יִגְזְל֥וּ מֵֽימֵי־שֶׁ֗לֶג שְׁא֣וֹל חָטָֽאוּ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Job is drawing a comparison. Alternate translation: “Just as drought and heat strip away the waters of snow, so Sheol strips away those who have sinned.”
24:19	b8g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִגְזְל֥וּ מֵֽימֵי־שֶׁ֗לֶג	1	Job is speaking as if, in the hot season, **Drought** and **heat** literally **strip away** the **waters** in his arid region that come from melting **snow** in the mountains. He means that the heat makes these waters evaporate. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “make water from melted snow evaporate”
24:20	hnl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִשְׁכָּ֘חֵ֤⁠הוּ רֶ֨חֶם ׀ מְתָ֘ק֤⁠וֹ רִמָּ֗ה ע֥וֹד לֹֽא־יִזָּכֵ֑ר	1	The pronouns **him** and **he** refers to a wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The womb will forget a wicked person, the worm will dine on that person, until he is not remembered”
24:20	dg9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׁכָּ֘חֵ֤⁠הוּ רֶ֨חֶם	1	Job is using the term **womb** by association to mean the mother who carried the wicked person in her womb and gave birth to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “As for a wicked person, even his own mother will forget him”
24:20	ja3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	מְתָ֘ק֤⁠וֹ רִמָּ֗ה	1	The term translated **dine** means to eat with enjoyment. Job is describing an ironic consequence that wicked people will experience. During their lives, as he said earlier, they had oil and wine and grain that they enjoyed but did not share with others. Now, after death, they provide a satisfying meal for the worms that eat them in their graves. Your language may have a term similar to **dine** that you could use in your translation.
24:20	auf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ע֥וֹד לֹֽא־יִזָּכֵ֑ר וַ⁠תִּשָּׁבֵ֖ר כָּ⁠עֵ֣ץ עַוְלָֽה	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “until no one remembers him and wickedness is like a tree that a windstorm has broken”
24:20	k6gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וַ⁠תִּשָּׁבֵ֖ר כָּ⁠עֵ֣ץ עַוְלָֽה	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **tree** may be **broken** (by a powerful wind, for example) so that it falls over and dies, so a wicked person will lose his possessions and status and ultimately die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and wickedness is broken, just as a windstorm knocks down a tree and it dies”
24:21	j776		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	רֹעֶ֣ה עֲ֭קָרָה	1	The pronoun **one** refers to a wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “A wicked person devours the barren”
24:21	ys4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רֹעֶ֣ה	1	Job is speaking as if a wicked person would literally devour or eat up childless women and widows. He means that the wicked person would cheat and exploit them in the ways he described earlier in this speech. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one exploiting”
24:21	j777		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עֲ֭קָרָה לֹ֣א תֵלֵ֑ד	1	Job is using the adjective **barren** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the barren woman, who has not borne”
24:21	m9u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	עֲ֭קָרָה לֹ֣א תֵלֵ֑ד	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “the childless woman”
24:21	j778		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	עֲ֭קָרָה לֹ֣א תֵלֵ֑ד	1	Job is not referring to a specific **barren** woman. He means women in general who have not had children.

24:21	i5m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠אַלְמָנָ֗ה לֹ֣א יְיֵטִֽיב	1	Job is not referring to a specific **widow**. He means widows in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “and he does not do good to widows”
24:21	j779		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ֝⁠אַלְמָנָ֗ה לֹ֣א יְיֵטִֽיב	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “and he harms the widow” or “and he harms widows”
24:22	xl8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וּ⁠מָשַׁ֣ךְ אַבִּירִ֣ים בְּ⁠כֹח֑⁠וֹ	1	In this first part of the verse, the pronouns **he** and **his** refer to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “But God drags away the mighty by his power”
24:22	ps1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מָשַׁ֣ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **drags away** people who are **mighty**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But he destroys”
24:22	j780		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אַבִּירִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “mighty people”
24:22	x59s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָ֝ק֗וּם וְֽ⁠לֹא־יַאֲמִ֥ין בַּֽ⁠חַיִּֽין	1	Interpreters are uncertain as to whom the pronoun **he** refers in the two instances in the second part of this verse. This could mean: (1) that God **arises** against mighty people, so that each one of them realizes that he is doomed. Alternate translation: “God arises against them, so that each one of them despairs of life” (2) that a wicked person **arises** or prospers for a time, but he has no assurance of a long life. Alternate translation: “a wicked person may prosper for a time, but he has no assurance of a long life”
24:23	j781		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִתֶּן־ל֣⁠וֹ לָ֭⁠בֶטַח וְ⁠יִשָּׁעֵ֑ן וְ֝⁠עֵינֵ֗י⁠הוּ עַל־דַּרְכֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The pronoun **He** in its first instance and the pronoun **his** refer to God, and the pronoun **he** in its second instance and the pronoun **him** refer to a wicked person. The pronoun **them** refers to wicked people in general. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God gives a wicked person security, and that person is supported, but God’s eyes are on the ways of wicked people”
24:23	j782		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִתֶּן־ל֣⁠וֹ לָ֭⁠בֶטַח וְ⁠יִשָּׁעֵ֑ן	1	If your language would not use the passive form **he is supported**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you would need to say who does the action, the context indicates that it is God. Alternate translation: “God gives him security and supports him”
24:23	j783		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	יִתֶּן־ל֣⁠וֹ לָ֭⁠בֶטַח וְ⁠יִשָּׁעֵ֑ן	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. While Job seems to say that God actively **gives** security and support to wicked people, the idea is that God actually allows these things. Alternate translation: “God may allow a wicked person to feel a sense of security”
24:23	qks3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ֝⁠עֵינֵ֗י⁠הוּ עַל־דַּרְכֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is using one part of God, his **eyes**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. Sight, in turn, represents awareness. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he watches their ways carefully” or “but he is very aware of their ways”
24:23	j784		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠עֵינֵ֗י⁠הוּ עַל־דַּרְכֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along.

24:24	j786		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ר֤וֹמּוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “They achieve greatness”
24:24	j787		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מְּעַ֨ט	1	This could mean: (1) that wicked people are exalted for a **little** while. Alternate translation: “for a short time” (2) that wicked people are exalted a **little** bit. Alternate translation: “to a limited extent”
24:24	b7v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְֽ⁠הֻמְּכ֗וּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

24:24	j797		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְֽ⁠אֵינֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	This expression means that these “mighty” people no longer exist. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then they no longer exist”
24:24	j788		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְֽ⁠הֻמְּכ֗וּ	1	Job is speaking as if wicked people were literally **brought low** or moved down to a low position. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Since this phrase repeats the meaning of **then they do not exist**, the meaning seems to be that they die. Alternate translation: “indeed, they die”
24:24	j5za		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כַּ⁠כֹּ֥ל יִקָּפְצ֑וּ⁠ן וּ⁠כְ⁠רֹ֖אשׁ שִׁבֹּ֣לֶת יִמָּֽלוּ	1	The phrase **they are gathered** could be: (1) a characteristic Hebrew expression that describes death. Alternate translation: “like all people, they are die; yes, like the tops of ears of grain, they are cut off” (2) part of the comparison to **ears of grain**. In that case, it would be appropriate to translate it literally. Alternate translation: “like all people, they are gathered and cut off like the tops of ears of grain”
24:24	ix1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠כֹּ֥ל יִקָּפְצ֑וּ⁠ן וּ⁠כְ⁠רֹ֖אשׁ שִׁבֹּ֣לֶת יִמָּֽלוּ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “And if anyone believes that what I have said is not true, then I challenge him to prove me wrong and show that what I have said is not valid”
24:25	j789		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אִם־לֹ֣א	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

24:25	j790		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלָּתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the term **word** to mean what he has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I have said”
25:intro	yz1x				0	# Job 25 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the third and final speech of Job’s friend Bildad.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The brevity of Bildad’s speech\n\nThis speech by Bildad is much shorter than his first two speeches. It is also much shorter than the three speeches that Eliphaz has given to this point in the book and the two speeches that Zophar has given. The likely explanation is that Job’s friends are running out of things to say to him. Indeed, Zophar does not give a third speech at all. The narrator says in [32:3](../32/03.md) that the three friends “found no answer” for Job’s arguments. The brevity of Bildad’s third speech and the absence of a third speech by Zophar dramatize this. Since the narrator eventually offers an explanation, it would not be necessary to put an explanation in your translation at the end of this chapter such as, “And that was all that Job’s friends had to say to him.”\n\n### God’s holiness and human sinfulness\nIn this short speech, Bildad describes God’s holiness and human sinfulness. While the points he makes are accurate, they are not convincing for Job, because he has actually been righteous. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Bildad using the words of Eliphaz\n\nAlthough Bildad speaks only briefly, he repeats significant phrases from Eliphaz’s first and second speeches. Bildad asks in verse 4, “So how will a man be righteous with God? Or how will one born of a woman be pure?” Eliphaz had asked similarly in 4:17, “Will a man be more righteous than God? If a man will be more pure than his Maker?” and in 15:14, “What is man, that he should be pure, or that one born of a woman should be righteous?” To show this, it would be helpful to use the same wording in your translation of 25:4 that you used in 4:17 and 15:14.
25:2	vb52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַמְשֵׁ֣ל וָ⁠פַ֣חַד עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Dominion and awe are with God” or “God possesses dominion and awe”
25:2	j791		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	הַמְשֵׁ֣ל וָ⁠פַ֣חַד עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **fear** tells what response God’s **Dominion** produces in those who recognize its powerful and holy character. (In this context, the word **fear** describes reverence and respect for God and awe at his greatness.) If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “Fearful dominion is with him” or “Awesome dominion is with him”
25:2	cz5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַמְשֵׁ֣ל וָ⁠פַ֣חַד עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **Dominion** and **fear**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God rules in a way that inspires great respect”
25:2	t8t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹשֶׂ֥ה שָׁ֝ל֗וֹם בִּ⁠מְרוֹמָֽי⁠ו	1	The word translated **peace** could mean: (1) harmonious order. Alternate translation: “the one who establishes harmonious order” (2) the absence of conflict. Alternate translation: “the one who rules without opposition” or “the one who rules without rebellion”
25:2	j792		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בִּ⁠מְרוֹמָֽי⁠ו	1	See how you translated the same expression in [16:19](../16/19.md). Alternate translation: “in his highest heaven” or “in heaven, where he rules supremely”
25:3	agz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יֵ֣שׁ מִ֭סְפָּר לִ⁠גְדוּדָ֑י⁠ו וְ⁠עַל־מִ֝֗י לֹא־יָק֥וּם אוֹרֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “There is no number to his troops! His light arises on everyone!”
25:3	tb5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠יֵ֣שׁ מִ֭סְפָּר לִ⁠גְדוּדָ֑י⁠ו	1	In this verse, Bildad is describing God’s greatness by saying that at night, there are too many stars in the sky to count, and by day, the sun shines all over the world. So in this context, the word **troops** implicitly refers to the stars as if they were soldiers. Alternate translation: “Is there a number to the stars?” or “There are too many stars in the sky to count!”
25:3	j793		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עַל־מִ֝֗י לֹא־יָק֥וּם אוֹרֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Bildad is using the term **light** by association to mean the sun. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And upon whom does the sun not rise?” or “And the sun shines on everyone!”
25:4	w2pf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַה־יִּצְדַּ֣ק אֱנ֣וֹשׁ עִם־אֵ֑ל וּ⁠מַה־יִּ֝זְכֶּ֗ה יְל֣וּד אִשָּֽׁה	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “A man cannot be righteous with God! One born of a woman cannot be clean!”
25:4	v4y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
25:4	kx6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יְל֣וּד אִשָּֽׁה	1	See how you translated this expression in [15:14](../15/14.md). Alternate translation: “a mortal”
25:5	un12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָ֭רֵחַ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַאֲהִ֑יל	1	Bildad implicitly means that compared with God’s holiness, the **moon** does not **shine** with the brightness of a pure, holy thing. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the moon has no holy brightness”
25:5	kt4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠עֵינָֽי⁠ו	1	Bildad is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in his perspective”
25:6	c7kh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אֱנ֣וֹשׁ רִמָּ֑ה	1	**Indeed that** is an expression that indicates that what follows is greater in degree than what a person has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How much less a man, a worm”
25:6	j794		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אֱנ֣וֹשׁ רִמָּ֑ה	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “How much less could a man, a worm, be pure”
25:6	l7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ & וּ⁠בֶן־אָ֝דָ֗ם	1	Although the terms **man** and **son** are masculine, here both words have a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a human … or a human child”
25:6	h6x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ רִמָּ֑ה	1	Bildad is speaking as if a human were literally a **worm**. He probably means that humans are lowly, just as worms are lowly, living in the dirt. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that lowly creature”
25:6	j795		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בֶן־אָ֝דָ֗ם תּוֹלֵעָֽה	1	Bildad is similarly speaking as if a human were literally a **grub**. Once again the basis of the comparison seems to be that just as grubs live in the earth, God originally formed humans from the earth. So this is a parallel poetic reference to human mortality. Rather than repeat the image, it may be more natural in your language to translate this as an explanatory phrase. Alternate translation, not preceded by a comma: “whom God formed from the earth”
26:intro	f665				0	# Job 26 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins a long response by Job first to Bildad’s last speech and then to the friends in general. Bildad had spoken briefly of the greatness of God. Job shows that he is a truly godly man who appreciates God’s greatness by describing it in this chapter at greater length and in more eloquent language. Job told the friends in 12:3 that he had just as much wisdom as they did, and he demonstrates that in this chapter.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 7–9, Job makes a series of statements about God that have a similar form. A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litany in chapter 12. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make each verse in the litany a separate sentence. For example, you could begin verse 7, “God stretches out.” Notes to verses 7–9 offer further suggestions.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Reference of “he,” “him,” and “his”\n\nThe pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” all refer to God throughout this chapter. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “God” or “God’s” at regular intervals for clarity.
26:2	lud4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	מֶה־עָזַ֥רְתָּ לְ⁠לֹא־כֹ֑חַ ה֝וֹשַׁ֗עְתָּ זְר֣וֹעַ לֹא־עֹֽז	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You have not helped the one without power! You have not saved the arm of no strength”
26:2	j798		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מֶה־עָזַ֥רְתָּ לְ⁠לֹא־כֹ֑חַ ה֝וֹשַׁ֗עְתָּ זְר֣וֹעַ לֹא־עֹֽז	1	Job is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “You have not helped me, even though I was without power! You have not saved me, even though my arm had no strength”
26:2	j799		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	עָזַ֥רְתָּ & ה֝וֹשַׁ֗עְתָּ	1	In this verse, as well as in verses 3 and 4, the word **you** is singular because Job is addressing Bildad directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
26:2	j800		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	זְר֣וֹעַ לֹא־עֹֽז	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **arm**, to mean all of him as someone who is struggling to have **strength** during difficulties. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a person of no strength” or “me, even though I had no strength”
26:3	s1r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	מַה־יָּ֭עַצְתָּ לְ⁠לֹ֣א חָכְמָ֑ה וְ֝⁠תוּשִׁיָּ֗ה לָ⁠רֹ֥ב הוֹדָֽעְתָּ	1	For emphasis, Job is continuing to say the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You have not really advised one without wisdom! You have not really made known insight in abundance”
26:3	y2kk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מַה־יָּ֭עַצְתָּ לְ⁠לֹ֣א חָכְמָ֑ה	1	Job is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “You have not really advised me, even though I was without wisdom”
26:4	n9vj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אֶת־מִ֭י הִגַּ֣דְתָּ מִלִּ֑ין וְ⁠נִשְׁמַת־מִ֝י יָצְאָ֥ה מִמֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Someone must have helped you declare those words! Someone else’s breath must have come out from you!”
26:4	j801		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־מִ֭י הִגַּ֣דְתָּ מִלִּ֑ין וְ⁠נִשְׁמַת־מִ֝י יָצְאָ֥ה מִמֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	Job is implying that God must have helped Bildad speak, although he does not really mean it (see next note). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God must have helped you declare those words! God’s own breath must have come out from you!”
26:4	j802		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אֶת־מִ֭י הִגַּ֣דְתָּ מִלִּ֑ין וְ⁠נִשְׁמַת־מִ֝י יָצְאָ֥ה מִמֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	For emphasis, Job is continuing to say the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You are merely sharing human opinions! You have no divinely granted insights!”
26:4	j803		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־מִ֭י הִגַּ֣דְתָּ מִלִּ֑ין	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what Bildad has just said by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God must have helped you say what you did!” or, showing that Job is saying the opposite of what he means, “What you said was merely your own human opinion”
26:4	j804		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠נִשְׁמַת־מִ֝י יָצְאָ֥ה מִמֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The word translated **breath** can also mean “spirit,” so this could mean: (1) that Job is making a parallel statement to the first part of the verse, using the **breath** that comes out of a person’s mouth while he is speaking to mean the act of speaking itself. Alternate translation: “And who was speaking with you as you spoke” or “And who enabled you to speak so well” or “It is certainly not as if God was helping you speak!” (2) that Job is suggesting (while meaning the opposite of what he is saying) that an angel or God’s Spirit must have inspired Bildad to say what he did. Alternate translation: “And what spirit inspired you to speak so well” or “And was it not God’s Spirit who inspired you to speak so well”
26:5	xqx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠רְפָאִ֥ים יְחוֹלָ֑לוּ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, at this point in this speech, Job begins a description of the greatness of God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “But as for the greatness of God, the Raphaites tremble”
26:5	c81a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠תַּ֥חַת מַ֝֗יִם וְ⁠שֹׁכְנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job implicitly means that the spirits of dead people **tremble** from their abode in Sheol, which he names specifically in the next verse but which he identifies by its location in this verse. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “from their abode deep below the sea, deep below the creatures that live in the sea”
26:6	j805		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עָר֣וֹם שְׁא֣וֹל נֶגְדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the pronoun **him** in this verse refers to God, as do the pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” throughout the chapter. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, here and at selected other places in the chapter. Alternate translation: “Sheol is naked before God”
26:6	c8rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עָר֣וֹם שְׁא֣וֹל נֶגְדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of **Sheol** as if it were literally not wearing any clothing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Sheol is open before God” or “God can look right into Sheol”
26:6	v85x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠אֵ֥ין כְּ֝ס֗וּת לָֽ⁠אֲבַדּֽוֹן	1	The word **Abaddon**, which means “destruction,” is another name for Sheol.
26:6	j806		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֵ֥ין כְּ֝ס֗וּת לָֽ⁠אֲבַדּֽוֹן	1	Job is speaking as if it might be possible to put an actual **covering** over **Abaddon** to keep God from seeing into it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and nothing keeps God from seeing into Abaddon”
26:7	j807		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	נֹטֶ֣ה צָפ֣וֹן עַל־תֹּ֑הוּ תֹּ֥לֶה אֶ֝֗רֶץ עַל־בְּלִי־מָֽה	1	Job is using the two major components of creation, the sky (which he calls the **north**) and the **earth**, to mean all of creation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the one having made all of creation where previously nothing was”
26:7	j808		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נֹטֶ֣ה צָפ֣וֹן עַל־תֹּ֑הוּ תֹּ֥לֶה אֶ֝֗רֶץ עַל־בְּלִי־מָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally stretched out the **north** (the sky) over **nothingness** and hung the **earth** on **nothing**. Since he speaks of the “pillars” of the heavens in verse 11, he is probably not saying directly that the sky and the earth are suspended over empty space. Instead, he is probably referring to God having created the sky and the land by bringing order to watery chaos. Job says this specifically in verses 12 and 13. Alternate translation: “the one having created the sky and the land by bringing order to watery chaos”
26:7	j809		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	נֹטֶ֣ה	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this is the beginning of a litany that extends through verse 9. See that discussion and the notes to verses 7–9 for suggestions of how to present this material in a way that may be helpful to your readers.
26:7	j810		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	נֹטֶ֣ה	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God, not to Abaddon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God is the one stretching out”
26:7	ts32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	צָפ֣וֹן	1	Job is using the term **north** by association to mean the bright constellations in the northern sky, and so by further association the stars, and by even further association the sky itself, where the stars appear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the sky”
26:8	q4f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	צֹרֵֽר־מַ֥יִם בְּ⁠עָבָ֑י⁠ו וְ⁠לֹא־נִבְקַ֖ע עָנָ֣ן תַּחְתָּֽ⁠ם	1	Job is speaking as if God literally uses **clouds** to bind or tie up the waters that eventually fall from those clouds to earth as rain. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “God makes rainclouds that contain much water”
26:8	j811		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ⁠לֹא־נִבְקַ֖ע עָנָ֣ן תַּחְתָּֽ⁠ם	1	Job is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means clouds, specifically rainclouds, in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “but those rainclouds are not torn under those waters”
26:8	sxg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹא־נִבְקַ֖ע עָנָ֣ן תַּחְתָּֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “but those waters do not tear the clouds under them” or “but the weight of those waters does not tear the clouds apart”
26:9	r35v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פְּנֵי	1	Job is speaking as if the surface of the **moon** were literally its **face**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the surface of”
26:9	j812		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	עֲנָנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means all the clouds that God would use to cover the moon. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “his clouds”
26:10	l8k5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֹֽק־חָ֭ג עַל־פְּנֵי־מָ֑יִם	1	Job is speaking as if the surface of the **waters** or oceans were literally their **face**. He is describing the horizon, which, to a land-bound observer, seems to be a limit on how far the oceans extend. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God has placed a circular limit on the surface of the oceans”
26:10	j813		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַד־תַּכְלִ֖ית א֣וֹר עִם־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Job implicitly means that the **limit** that God has placed on the extent of the oceans coincides with the bottom of the dome of the sky, which people in this culture considered to be a solid object. Beneath the dome, in which the sun, moon, and stars shone, there was light. Beyond the dome was darkness. So Job is using **the boundary of light with darkness** to refer by association to the sky. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “at the bottom of the dome of the sky”
26:11	n3vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	עַמּוּדֵ֣י שָׁמַ֣יִם יְרוֹפָ֑פוּ וְ֝⁠יִתְמְה֗וּ מִ⁠גַּעֲרָתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Many interpreters believe that here Job is speaking of high mountains as if they were the **pillars of the heavens**, since they appear to hold up the sky. Job would also be speaking as if God were literally issuing a **rebuke** to the mountains and that in response, they **tremble and marvel**. The reference may be to an earthquake, which causes mountains to shake. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God sends earthquakes that make even the high mountains shake”
26:11	f7hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	יְרוֹפָ֑פוּ וְ֝⁠יִתְמְה֗וּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **marvel**, a reference to being astonished by the power of God, tells why the pillars of the heavens **tremble**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “shake with fear”
26:12	x7ti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מָ֣חַץ רָֽהַב	1	See how you translated the name Rahab in [9:13](../09/13.md). Alternate translation: ”he defeated the sea monster that is associated with chaos“
26:13	c72v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ֭⁠רוּח⁠וֹ שָׁמַ֣יִם שִׁפְרָ֑ה	1	Job is probably speaking as if strong winds, which clear the clouds from the sky after a storm, are the **breath** of God. Even though the word translated **breath** can also mean “wind” or “Spirit,” Job is probably using a poetic image rather than a literal statement to describe the power of God. If it would be more natural in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God sends strong winds to clear the sky of clouds after a storm”
26:13	c2jc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 נָחָ֥שׁ בָּרִֽיחַ	1	The expression **the fleeing serpent** is another name for the sea monster. (In [Isaiah 27:1](../27/01.md), the sea monster is called ”the fleeing serpent“ and Leviathan.) See how you translated the name Leviathan in [3:8](../03/08.md) and the name Rahab in the previous verse. Alternate translation: ”the sea monster that is associated with chaos“
26:13	r5le		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	חֹֽלֲלָ֥ה יָ֝ד֗⁠וֹ נָחָ֥שׁ בָּרִֽיחַ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of doing combat with the chaos monster. He means that with a weapon such as a sword, God **pierced** the monster, that is, stabbed it to death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in combat, he killed the chaos monster”
26:14	j814		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	קְצ֬וֹת דְּרָכָ֗יו	1	Job is speaking of the things that God does as if they were **ways** or paths that God was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “are a small part of his actions”
26:14	k819		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מַה־שֵּׁ֣מֶץ דָּ֭בָר נִשְׁמַע־בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job may be using the term **word** in the sense of the sound of a word, in which case the term **small** would indicate a faint sound or whisper. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and how faint a whisper we hear of him”
26:14	b468		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠רַ֥עַם גְּ֝בוּרוֹתָ֗יו מִ֣י יִתְבּוֹנָֽן	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No, no one can understand the thunder of his power!”
26:14	j815		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠רַ֥עַם גְּ֝בוּרוֹתָ֗יו	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe **thunder** that is characterized by **power**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And his powerful thunder”
27:intro	mkb5				0	# Job 27 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Bildad and the other two friends.\n- Verses 1–10: Job insists that he is godly and will continue to live that way\n- Verses 11–23: Job describes how God punishes wicked people\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Reference of “he,” “him,” and “his”\n\nFrom verse 14 through to the end of the chapter, the pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” refer to the “wicked man” whom Job first mentions in verse 13. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “a wicked man” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do this at various places.
27:1	j816		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֹּ֣סֶף אִ֭יּוֹב שְׂאֵ֥ת מְשָׁל֗⁠וֹ וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	The narrator is speaking as if Job’s **discourse** or speech were an object that he could **take up** or pick up. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “As Job continued his speech, he said” or “Job continued speaking and he said”
27:2	tp23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	חַי־אֵ֭ל הֵסִ֣יר מִשְׁפָּטִ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠שַׁדַּ֗י הֵמַ֥ר נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “As God lives, who has taken away my justice; as the Almighty lives, who has made my life bitter”
27:2	vm9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	חַי־אֵ֭ל הֵסִ֣יר מִשְׁפָּטִ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠שַׁדַּ֗י הֵמַ֥ר נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Job is swearing an oath in the way that was characteristic in his culture. In your translation, you can translate this in the way that would be characteristic in your culture. Alternate translation: “I swear by God, who has turned away my justice; I swear by the Almighty, who has made my life bitter”
27:2	zm2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הֵסִ֣יר מִשְׁפָּטִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking of his **justice** as if it were an object that God had **taken away** from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who has denied justice to me”
27:3	j817		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **that** to introduce the content of the oath that he began to swear in the previous verse. In some cases, if you translated the previous verse to reflect the way people swear oaths in your culture, you may not need to include the word **that** here. If you chose to reflect the way Job swore this oath following the practices of his own culture, it may be helpful to show what he is using the word **that** to mean. Alternate translation: “I swear that”
27:3	xg5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠ר֖וּחַ אֱל֣וֹהַּ בְּ⁠אַפִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the **breath** in his **nose** by association to mean breathing, and he is using breathing by association to mean being alive. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and for as long as I draw the breath of life” or “and for as long as I am alive”
27:4	xct5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	אִם־תְּדַבֵּ֣רְנָה שְׂפָתַ֣⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה וּ֝⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֗⁠י אִם־יֶהְגֶּ֥ה רְמִיָּֽה	1	This is the conclusion of the oath that Job is swearing. In this culture, people would swear an oath by stating the first part of a condition but not the second part. (But see the General Notes to chapter 31, which explain how Job does state the second part of many conditions in the oaths that he swears in that chapter.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explicitly state the implied second part of the condition. Alternate translation: “if my lips speak wickedness, or if my tongue utters deceit, may God punish me severely!”
27:4	j818		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אִם־תְּדַבֵּ֣רְנָה שְׂפָתַ֣⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה וּ֝⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֗⁠י אִם־יֶהְגֶּ֥ה רְמִיָּֽה	1	Job is using parts of himself, his **lips** and his **tongue**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I speak wickedness or utter deceit”
27:4	vg54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִם־תְּדַבֵּ֣רְנָה שְׂפָתַ֣⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה וּ֝⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֗⁠י אִם־יֶהְגֶּ֥ה רְמִיָּֽה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **wickedness** and **deceit**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “if I say anything that is wicked or deceitful”
27:5	tp64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	חָלִ֣ילָ⁠ה לִּ⁠י֮ אִם־אַצְדִּ֪יק אֶ֫תְ⁠כֶ֥ם	1	Job is using this expression to mean that he would no more **justify** his friends (that is, agree that they are right) than he would commit a **Sacrilege**, that is, do something that he knew would be offensive to God in a religious sense. Your language may have an expression with a similar sense that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “God forbid that I justify you” or “Far be it from me to justify you”
27:5	n6mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶ֫תְ⁠כֶ֥ם	1	The word **you** is plural here because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
27:5	j819		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	אֶגְוָ֑ע	1	See how you translated the term **expire** in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “I pass away”
27:5	uy2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹא־אָסִ֖יר תֻּמָּתִ֣⁠י מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי	1	Job is speaking as if his **integrity**, meaning in this case his conviction that he has been acting properly, were a person whom he could **turn away** and make go somewhere else. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will keep insisting that I have been acting properly”
27:6	rv4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠צִדְקָתִ֣⁠י הֶ֭חֱזַקְתִּי וְ⁠לֹ֣א אַרְפֶּ֑⁠הָ	1	Job is speaking as if his **righteousness** were literally an object that he was holding onto. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am going to continue to insist that I am righteous”
27:6	ttu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לֹֽא־יֶחֱרַ֥ף לְ֝בָבִ֗⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his **heart**, which in this context represents his conscience, were a person who might **reproach** him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not have a guilty conscience”
27:6	j820		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹֽא־יֶחֱרַ֥ף לְ֝בָבִ֗⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **reproach**. Alternate translation: “I will be confident that I have acted properly”
27:6	j821		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠יָּמָֽ⁠י	1	Job is using this expression to describe his lifetime. He means the period extending from his earliest **days** of life to the present. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for as long as I live”
27:7	qkh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יְהִ֣י כְ֭⁠רָשָׁע אֹ֣יְבִ֑⁠י וּ⁠מִתְקוֹמְמִ֥⁠י כְ⁠עַוָּֽל	1	In this culture, people would make clear that they did not want something to happen to them by saying they wanted it to happen to their enemies. That showed that it was the opposite of what they wanted for themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I do not want to be anything like the wicked or the unrighteous”
27:7	j822		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	כְ֭⁠רָשָׁע & כְ⁠עַוָּֽל	1	Job is using the adjectives **wicked** and **unrighteous** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “like wicked people … like unrighteous people”
27:7	j823		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּ⁠מִתְקוֹמְמִ֥⁠י כְ⁠עַוָּֽל	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and may the one rising up against me be like the unrighteous”
27:7	cin4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מִתְקוֹמְמִ֥⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if this person were literally **rising up**, that is, standing up from a seating or lying position, in order to attack him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the one opposing me”
27:8	m193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כִּ֤י מַה־תִּקְוַ֣ת חָ֭נֵף כִּ֣י יִבְצָ֑ע כִּ֤י יֵ֖שֶׁל אֱל֣וֹהַּ נַפְשֽׁ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “For the godless has no hope when he cuts him off, when God takes away his life.”
27:8	j824		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כִּ֤י מַה־תִּקְוַ֣ת חָ֭נֵף	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “For what does the godless hope for” or, as a statement, “For the godless has nothing to hope for”
27:8	j825		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָ֭נֵף	1	Job is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a godless person”
27:8	twt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כִּ֣י יִבְצָ֑ע כִּ֤י יֵ֖שֶׁל אֱל֣וֹהַּ נַפְשֽׁ⁠וֹ	1	As the context makes clear, the pronoun **he** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers by naming God in the first part of the verse and using a pronoun in the second part of the verse. Alternate translation: “when God cuts him off, when he takes away his life”
27:8	d94d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִבְצָ֑ע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [6:9](../06/09.md). Alternate translation: “he kills him” or “God kills him”
27:9	jh1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַֽ֭⁠צַעֲקָת⁠וֹ יִשְׁמַ֥ע ׀ אֵ֑ל כִּֽי־תָב֖וֹא עָלָ֣י⁠ו צָרָֽה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “God will not hear his cry when trouble comes upon him!”
27:9	a8tx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הַֽ֭⁠צַעֲקָת⁠וֹ יִשְׁמַ֥ע ׀ אֵ֑ל	1	Job is using the term **hear** in a specific sense to mean “answer.” Alternate translation: “Will God answer his cry for help”
27:9	j826		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	כִּֽי־תָב֖וֹא עָלָ֣י⁠ו צָרָֽה	1	Job is speaking of **trouble** as if it were a living thing that could **come upon** a wicked person (for example, as an animal might pounce on its prey). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when he experiences trouble” or “when he gets into trouble”
27:10	kq3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־עַל־שַׁדַּ֥י יִתְעַנָּ֑ג יִקְרָ֖א אֱל֣וֹהַּ בְּ⁠כָל־עֵֽת	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “He will not delight himself in the Almighty! He will not call to God in every time!”
27:11	s3uq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֣ם	1	The word **you** is plural here because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
27:11	fyx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יַד־אֵ֑ל	1	Here, **hand** represents the activity of a person by association with the way that people use their hands to do things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “about the activity of God”
27:11	j827		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֥ר עִם־שַׁ֝דַּ֗י	1	Job is not using this expression to suggest that there are certain things **with** the Almighty, that is, objects that are in his presence. Rather, the expression refers to the things that pertain to the Almighty, meaning his characteristic ways of doing things. In this context, the expression refers to the way that the Almighty actually treats the wicked. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “how the Almighty does things” or “how the Almighty actually treats the wicked,”
27:11	re4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֣א אֲכַחֵֽד	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **conceal**. Alternate translation: “I will reveal”
27:12	j828		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַתֶּ֣ם כֻּלְּ⁠כֶ֣ם חֲזִיתֶ֑ם	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **yourselves**. Alternate translation: “all of you have seen this quite clearly”
27:12	j830		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַתֶּ֣ם כֻּלְּ⁠כֶ֣ם חֲזִיתֶ֑ם	1	In this context, to **see** means to “experience.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all of you have experienced this quite consistently”
27:12	pnx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לָ⁠מָּה־זֶּ֝֗ה הֶ֣בֶל תֶּהְבָּֽלוּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “therefore you should not vainly speak this vanity”
27:12	j831		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וְ⁠לָ⁠מָּה־זֶּ֝֗ה הֶ֣בֶל תֶּהְבָּֽלוּ	1	For emphasis, Job is using a construction in which a subject and its verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “why then do you speak this utter vanity” or, as a statement, “you should therefore not speak this utter vanity”
27:13	g6qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זֶ֤ה ׀ חֵֽלֶק־אָדָ֖ם רָשָׁ֥ע ׀ עִם־אֵ֑ל	1	Job is speaking as if the punishment that God assigns to a **wicked man** were literally a **portion** or share of goods that God allotted to that person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is the punishment that God assigns to a wicked man”
27:13	j832		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָדָ֖ם רָשָׁ֥ע	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a wicked person”
27:13	djh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְֽ⁠נַחֲלַ֥ת עָ֝רִיצִ֗ים מִ⁠שַּׁדַּ֥י יִקָּֽחוּ	1	Job is speaking as if the punishment that the Almighty assigns to **oppressors** were literally a **heritage** or inheritance that he leaves to them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and this is the punishment that oppressors receive from the Almighty”
27:14	f7mj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אִם־יִרְבּ֣וּ בָנָ֣י⁠ו לְמוֹ־חָ֑רֶב	1	Job is using the term **sword** by association to mean death, since in this culture people killed others with swords. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Even if a wicked person has many children, they will all die”
27:14	j833		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לָֽחֶם	1	Job is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “food”
27:15	dic8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שְׂ֭רִידָיו בַּ⁠מָּ֣וֶת יִקָּבֵ֑רוּ	1	The term **death** could mean: (1) death literally. Alternate translation: “His survivor will die and be buried” (2) a plague, in which case Job would be using a general term for death to mean one specific cause of death. There is a similar use in [Jeremiah 15:2](../15/02.md). In that case Job could also be speaking as if the plague itself had buried this **survivor**, meaning that it had caused his death. Alternate translation: “His survivor will be buried by a plague” or “A plague will kill his survivor”
27:15	mbb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׂ֭רִידָיו	1	This could mean: (1) the wicked person’s last surviving descendant. Alternate translation: “his last survivor” or “the end of his line” (2) not a specific **survivor** but his surviving descendants in general. Alternate translation: “his descendants”
27:15	p4u3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠אַלְמְנֹתָ֗י⁠ו לֹ֣א תִבְכֶּֽינָה	1	In this culture, a man might marry more than one woman, so by **widows**, Job means implicitly that this “wicked man” had more than one wife. You may find it more suitable to use a singular form in your translation. Alternate translation: “and his widow will not lament”
27:16	nm9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יִצְבֹּ֣ר כֶּ⁠עָפָ֣ר כָּ֑סֶף וְ֝⁠כַ⁠חֹ֗מֶר יָכִ֥ין מַלְבּֽוּשׁ	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **dust** is abundant and **clay mounds** contain great quantities of clay, so a wicked person might acquire **silver** in abundance and **clothing** in great quantities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “a wicked person acquires an abundant amount of silver and great quantities of clothing”
27:16	j834		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָּ֑סֶף	1	Job is using one valuable commodity, **silver**, to represent wealth in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “wealth”
27:17	bh15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠צַדִּ֣יק & נָקִ֥י	1	Job is using the adjectives **righteous** and **innocent** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “but a righteous person … an innocent person”
27:18	q8ia		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	בָּנָ֣ה כָ⁠עָ֣שׁ בֵּית֑⁠וֹ וּ֝⁠כְ⁠סֻכָּ֗ה עָשָׂ֥ה נֹצֵֽר	1	The point of these comparisons is that the **house** of a **moth**, that is, its cocoon, is very fragile, as is a **hut** that a **guard** would build in a field out of branches to watch over crops during harvest time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “The house that he builds is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon, as rickety as a hut that a guard would build out of branches”
27:18	inb4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בָּנָ֣ה כָ⁠עָ֣שׁ בֵּית֑⁠וֹ וּ֝⁠כְ⁠סֻכָּ֗ה עָשָׂ֥ה נֹצֵֽר	1	While the actual house of a wicked person might become abandoned and collapse from neglect, Job could be using the term **house** to represent the life of that person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The life that he creates for himself is as fragile as a moth’s cocoon, as rickety as a hut that a guard would build from branches”
27:18	j835		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בָּנָ֣ה כָ⁠עָ֣שׁ בֵּית֑⁠וֹ	1	A **moth** is a flying insect that is typically active at night. It begins life as a wingless larva. The larva eventually spins a silk cocoon around itself, and inside that cocoon, it changes into a flying moth. If your readers would not be familiar with what a moth is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable creature that your readers would recognize and that similarly builds a fragile structure. The UST models one way to do this.
27:19	la2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עָשִׁ֣יר יִ֭שְׁכַּב & עֵינָ֖י⁠ו פָּקַ֣ח	1	Job is speaking of going to sleep and waking up by association with things that people do when they go to sleep (lie down in bed) and wake up (open their eyes). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He goes to sleep rich … he wakes up”
27:19	b9sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	עָשִׁ֣יר יִ֭שְׁכַּב & עֵינָ֖י⁠ו פָּקַ֣ח	1	Job is making an overstatement to emphasize how quickly a wicked person loses his wealth. He is speaking as if that person would go to sleep rich and wake up with nothing, that is, as if he would lose all of his riches in a single night. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “He may be rich … only a short time passes”
27:19	i6ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יֵאָסֵ֑ף	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but he does not continue to be rich”
27:19	x5lq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֵינֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	This expression means that the wicked person no longer has any possessions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he discovers that he no longer has any possessions”
27:20	zw56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ֝֗יְלָה גְּנָבַ֥תּ⁠וּ סוּפָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if a **storm** would literally carry a wicked person away. He means that that person perishes as quickly and unexpectedly as he would if a storm carried him away. It may be more natural in your language to represent this image as a comparison. Alternate translation: “he perishes quickly and unexpectedly, as if a storm had carried him away in the night”
27:21	l4at		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִשָּׂאֵ֣⁠הוּ קָדִ֣ים וְ⁠יֵלַ֑ךְ וִֽ֝⁠ישָׂעֲרֵ֗⁠הוּ מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is continuing to speak as if a **wind** would literally pick up a wicked person and carry him away. If you decided to represent this image as a comparison in the previous verse, you can continue to do that in this verse. Alternate translation: “Yes, it is as if the east wind takes him away, blowing him right out of his home, so that he is gone”
27:21	j836		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קָדִ֣ים	1	Job lived in a place where there was desert to the **east**, so he is referring implicitly to a strong, hot wind coming from the desert. In your translation, you could refer to the direction from which the strongest and stormiest winds come in your area.
27:22	wmn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠יַשְׁלֵ֣ךְ עָ֭לָי⁠ו וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַחְמֹ֑ל	1	Job is speaking of this wind as if it were a living thing that could hurl itself upon a wicked person and not **pity** him, that is, not show him any mercy. If you decided to represent this image as a comparison in the previous two verses, you can continue to do that in this verse. Alternate translation: “It is as if a violent wind is blowing against him relentlessly”
27:22	xs2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	בָּר֥וֹחַ יִבְרָֽח	1	Job is repeating the verb “flee” in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. The specific sense here is that the wicked person is trying desperately to flee from this strong wind. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis.

In this context, Job is speaking as if the wind were expressing derision at the wicked person. If it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if people in your culture clap their hands together to express positive emotions such as approval and admiration, you could explain the significance of this action in your translation. You could also name a gesture that people in your culture use to express derision. Alternate translation: “It is as if such a wind claps its hands at him in derision” or “It is as if such a wind points its finger derisively at him”
27:23	r28v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠יִשְׁרֹ֥ק עָ֝לָ֗י⁠ו	1	In this culture, people would make a hissing sound in order to express derision. Job is speaking as if the wind were also expressing derision at the wicked person by making such a sound. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in your translation. You could also name a sound that people in your culture make in order to express derision. Alternate translation: “and makes a derisive hissing sound” or “and laughs derisively at him”
27:23	j837		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	This could mean: (1) that the wind Job is describing **hisses** at the wicked person from within the home that it has forced him to abandon. (Job says of the wind in verse 21, “it blasts him from his place.”) Alternate translation: “from within his former home, which this wind now occupies” (2) that the wind **hisses** at the wicked person now that he is out of **his place**. Alternate translation: “because he has had to abandon his home”
28:intro	i55c				0	# Job 28 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Bildad and the other two friends. In this part of his speech, Job discusses how people can obtain wisdom. Both he and his friends have stressed the importance of wisdom (for example, in 12:2, 15:8, and 26:3). Job says at the end of this eloquent discussion, “Behold, the fear of the Lord—that is wisdom, and to turn from evil is understanding.” The implication is that Job, who prizes wisdom so much, would not have disrespected God, committed evil, and thus missed out on having wisdom. So in this chapter, Job gives another important defense of his innocence.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Reference of “it” in verses 13–18\n\nJob introduces the subject of “wisdom” in verse 12. Then, from verse 14 through to the end of the chapter, he refers to wisdom most of the time with the pronouns “it” and “its.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify the referent and say “wisdom” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do this at various places.
28:1	fb4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּ֝⁠מָק֗וֹם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

28:2	b12i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אֶ֗בֶן יָצ֥וּק נְחוּשָֽׁה	1	Job is speaking of the ore from which **copper** is **smelted** as **stone**, since that ore is a type of stone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and people smelt copper from ore”
28:2	uui9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ֝⁠אֶ֗בֶן יָצ֥וּק נְחוּשָֽׁה	1	The term “smelt” means to break ore into pieces and to use great heat to melt it so that a metal such as **copper** will separate from it. If your readers would not be familiar with the process of smelting, you could describe it with a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “and people break up ore and melt it in order to extract copper from it”
28:3	fm47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קֵ֤ץ ׀ שָׂ֤ם לַ⁠חֹ֗שֶׁךְ	1	Job means implicitly that the person he is describing either brings lights underground, where there is otherwise **darkness**, or opens a mineshaft that lets light in.

28:3	l74r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וּֽ⁠לְ⁠כָל־תַּ֭כְלִית ה֣וּא חוֹקֵ֑ר אֶ֖בֶן	1	Job says **every** here as a generalization for emphasis.

28:3	j841		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אֶ֖בֶן אֹ֣פֶל וְ⁠צַלְמָֽוֶת	1	Job is not referring to a specific **stone**. He means in general stone that contains precious metal, that is, ore. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “ore that can only be found in gloom and deep darkness”
28:3	sce6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	אֶ֖בֶן אֹ֣פֶל וְ⁠צַלְמָֽוֶת	1	The terms **gloom** and **deep darkness** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis.

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Since Job uses plural forms in the rest of this verse, you may wish to use a plural form here. Alternate translation: “Miners open shafts”
28:4	j843		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מֵֽ⁠עִם־גָּ֗ר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **habitation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “far from where people live”

28:4	hz3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הַֽ⁠נִּשְׁכָּחִ֥ים מִנִּי־רָ֑גֶל	1	Job is speaking of a **foot** as if it were a living thing that could be unaware of something. (That is what the term **forgotten** indicates here.) This could be describing: (1) the location of the mines. Job would be saying that they are in remote places where people do not go. In that case the word **foot** would represent people traveling. Alternate translation: “in places where people do not go”(2) the way that people walk on the ground above mines without realizing that miners are at work deep below them. Alternate translation, beginning a new sentence: “The people walking on the ground high above miners do not realize that they are there” 
28:4	j845		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	מֵ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “Away from other people”
28:4	yed2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	דַּ֖לּוּ & נָֽעוּ	1	Job means implicitly that these miners **dangle and swing** from ropes in order to get down into the mines. He is emphasizing the risks that people will take in order to find precious metals. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they dangle and swing dangerously from ropes in order to get down into their mines”
28:5	j846		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֶ֗רֶץ מִמֶּ֥⁠נָּה יֵֽצֵא־לָ֑חֶם וְ֝⁠תַחְתֶּ֗י⁠הָ נֶהְפַּ֥ךְ כְּמוֹ־אֵֽשׁ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. In this verse, Job is drawing a contrast between the ordinary activities that take place on the surface of the earth and the extraordinary, dangerous activities that take place in mines below the earth. Alternate translation: “People grow food on the surface of the earth, but below the surface, people transform the earth by means such as fire”
28:5	r3d3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לָ֑חֶם	1	Job is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “food”

He is speaking generally of how miners reshape the terrain in which they work. (This could include actual overturning in some cases.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the terrain is reshaped as with fire” or “miners reshape the terrain as with fire”
28:5	p8vk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נֶהְפַּ֥ךְ כְּמוֹ־אֵֽשׁ	1	Job assumes that his friends will understand that he is using the term **fire** to refer to an ancient mining practice. Miners would build fires against the walls of mines to heat the rock. They would then splash water against the heated rock to cause it to crack. This allowed them to extract ore more readily. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “miners reshape the terrain as they heat rock with fire and then douse it with water to crack it”

28:17	z7jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וּ⁠זְכוֹכִ֑ית	1	The term **crystal** could be describing: (1) a beautiful natural form that a clear or colored mineral might take, allowing light to shine through it.

28:18	j860		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	רָאמ֣וֹת וְ֭⁠גָבִישׁ לֹ֣א יִזָּכֵ֑ר	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “One does not even mention coral or jasper when discussing things that might be worth as much as wisdom”
28:18	vgj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	רָאמ֣וֹת	1	**Coral** is a beautiful, hard substance that grows on ocean reefs. If your readers would not be familiar with what coral is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “Beautiful seashells”
28:18	sqn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ֭⁠גָבִישׁ	1	The word **jasper** describes a precious stone, often reddish-brown, that often has streaks and markings of other colors. If your readers would not be familiar with what jasper is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable precious stone that they would recognize. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “and precious stones”
28:18	j861		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מִ⁠פְּנִינִֽים	1	The word **rubies** describes brilliant gemstones that are often deep red.

Alternate translation: “The eyes of no living thing can see it; not even the birds of the heavens can spot it”
28:21	bj7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מֵ⁠עֵינֵ֣י	1	Job is using one part of a **living thing**, its **eyes**, to mean all of it in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the sight of”
28:22	j862		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲבַדּ֣וֹן וָ֭⁠מָוֶת אָ֣מְר֑וּ בְּ֝⁠אָזְנֵ֗י⁠נוּ שָׁמַ֥עְנוּ שִׁמְעָֽ⁠הּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

As a note to [26:6](../26/06.md) explains, Abaddon is another name for Sheol, the abode of the dead. In this context, the term **death** likely refers by association to the abode of the dead. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “The underworld says, ‘I have heard a rumor of it with my ears’”
28:22	j864		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	 בְּ֝⁠אָזְנֵ֗י⁠נוּ שָׁמַ֥עְנוּ שִׁמְעָֽ⁠הּ	1	The speakers mean that while they have **heard** of wisdom with their **ears**, they have not seen it with their eyes or encountered it in person. So the mention of the **ears**, which might otherwise seem like extra information because the notion is already implicit in the term **heard**, actually serves to limit the statement, You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “We have only heard a rumor of it”

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God understands how humans can obtain wisdom, yes, he knows how they can become wise”
28:23	j865		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	דַּרְכָּ֑⁠הּ	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe not the **way** that wisdom takes but the **way** that leads to wisdom. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the way that leads to wisdom”
28:24	j866		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּי	1	Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said in the preceding verse that God knew where to find wisdom.

28:24	q6zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ה֭וּא לִ⁠קְצוֹת־הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ יַבִּ֑יט תַּ֖חַת כָּל־הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֣יִם יִרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the two main components of creation, **earth** and the **heavens**, to mean the entire creation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “he can see everything in the entire creation”
28:24	j867		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ה֭וּא & יַבִּ֑יט	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **he**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **looks**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “he is the one who looks”
28:25	j868		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לַ⁠עֲשׂ֣וֹת לָ⁠ר֣וּחַ מִשְׁקָ֑ל	1	Job is using the term **weight** to mean “force.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “When he determined the force of the wind”
28:25	l7lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠מַ֗יִם תִּכֵּ֥ן בְּ⁠מִדָּֽה	1	Job is referring implicitly to the rain **waters** that clouds contain.

Alternate translation: “And he told man that the fear of the Lord was indeed wisdom and that to turn from evil was understanding”
28:28	j872		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

28:28	l4bu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יִרְאַ֣ת אֲ֭דֹנָ⁠י	1	The Lord is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “to fear me” or “to reverence me”

29:intro	eli2				0	# Job 29 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Job’s final response to his three friends. In this chapter, Job recalls the honor he enjoyed and the influence he exercised within his community before he suffered so many misfortunes.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 2–6, Job makes a series of statements about what his life was like before his present troubles. He expresses a wish in verse 2 that his life could be like this again, and in verses 3–6 he offers a series of descriptions that each begin with “when” or “as that.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litany in chapter 12. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make each verse in the litany a separate sentence. For example, you could begin verse 3, “At that time.”\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Reference of “they” in verses 21–25\n\nJob uses “they” in verses 21–25 as an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify a general referent such as “people” at regular intervals for clarity. Notes suggest how you might do that at various places.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to be as I was in time past, as in the time when God kept me”
29:3	n6gg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠הִלּ֣⁠וֹ נֵ֭ר⁠וֹ עֲלֵ֣י רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י לְ֝⁠אוֹר⁠וֹ אֵ֣לֶךְ חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **shone** a **lamp** above and around him so that he could see where to walk even in the **darkness**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when God showed me clearly what to do so that I could make the right choices even in confusing situations”
29:3	z42n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֲלֵ֣י רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **head**, to mean all of him when speaking as if God **shone** a **lamp** above and around him. He is probably speaking of himself in terms of his head because that would have been the part of him closest to the lamp. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “above and around me”
29:4	bk56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י חָרְפִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at the time when I was in my prime”
29:4	j876		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠ס֥וֹד אֱ֝ל֗וֹהַּ עֲלֵ֣י אָהֳלִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God’s **friendship** were literally an object that had rested **upon** his tent. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when God in friendship blessed my tent”
29:4	d6y9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אָהֳלִֽ⁠י	1	As the next two verses indicate, Job is referring to his family by association with the **tent** in which they lived and to his possessions by association with the same **tent**, in which he kept them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my family and my possessions”
29:5	j877		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	סְבִ֖יבוֹתַ֣⁠י נְעָרָֽ⁠י	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “when my children were still around me”
29:6	xbc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠רְחֹ֣ץ הֲלִיכַ֣⁠י בְּ⁠חֵמָ֑ה וְ⁠צ֥וּר יָצ֥וּק עִ֝מָּדִ֗⁠י פַּלְגֵי־שָֽׁמֶן	1	Job is speaking as if his herds used to produce so much milk that there was **butter** everywhere he went, so that when he walked anywhere, it was as if his feet were literally being **bathed** in butter. He is also speaking as if his olive trees used to produce so many olives that it was as if there were literally **streams** of oil coming to him out of the rocks. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when my herds produced milk in great abundance and my olive trees yielded great quantities of oil for me”
29:6	j878		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בִּ⁠רְחֹ֣ץ הֲלִיכַ֣⁠י בְּ⁠חֵמָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when butter bathed my steps”
29:6	bt34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ⁠צ֥וּר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **rock**. He means rocks in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “and the rocks”
29:7	tvt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בָּ֝⁠רְח֗וֹב אָכִ֥ין מוֹשָׁבִֽ⁠י	1	Taking a **seat** in the public **square** by the city **gate** was a symbolic action by which Job showed that he was a recognized community leader, a member of the council that settled legal matters for the city residents. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “when I took my seat in the square as a recognized community leader”
29:8	j879		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נֶחְבָּ֑אוּ	1	This expression does not mean that these **young men** looked for hiding places where no one would find them. It means that they moved back from the place where the leaders sat, blending into the crowd. The idea is that before Job came, they thought they might have something to contribute to the deliberations after their elders had spoken, as Elihu does in this book starting in chapter 32. But once Job arrived, they knew that his wise counsel would settle matters and they would have no need or opportunity to contribute. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and withdrew” or “and stepped aside out of respect”
29:8	e835		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וִֽ֝⁠ישִׁישִׁים קָ֣מוּ עָמָֽדוּ	1	Rising and standing when Job arrived was a symbolic action that showed respect for his wisdom and place in the community. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and old men rose and stood out of respect for me”
29:8	j880		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	קָ֣מוּ עָמָֽדוּ	1	The terms **rose** and **stood** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “stood to their feet”
29:9	c8d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עָצְר֣וּ בְ⁠מִלִּ֑ים	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what these **princes** had been saying by using words before he arrived. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “stopped speaking”
29:9	j881		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ֝⁠כַ֗ף יָשִׂ֥ימוּ לְ⁠פִי⁠הֶֽם	1	Since Job is speaking of many people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural forms of **hand** and **mouth**. Alternate translation: “and they put their hands on their mouths” or “and they covered their mouths with their hands”
29:9	v8ym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ֝⁠כַ֗ף יָשִׂ֥ימוּ לְ⁠פִי⁠הֶֽם	1	Covering the **mouth** with the **hand** prevents a person from speaking. While the **princes** could simply have stopped talking without doing that, they did it as a symbolic action to show respect for Job, indicating that there was nothing they could say that would be more valuable than what he would say. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and they covered their mouths with their hands to indicate respectfully that there was nothing they could say that would be more valuable than what I would say”
29:10	j882		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	קוֹל & וּ֝⁠לְשׁוֹנָ֗⁠ם & לְ⁠חִכָּ֥⁠ם	1	Since Job is speaking of many people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural forms of **voice**, **tongue**, and **palate**.

29:10	u1bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	קוֹל־נְגִידִ֥ים נֶחְבָּ֑אוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The nobles hushed their voices”
29:10	nm6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠לְשׁוֹנָ֗⁠ם לְ⁠חִכָּ֥⁠ם דָּבֵֽקָה	1	Job is speaking as if the **tongue** of each noble literally **stuck** to his **palate**, that is, to the roof of his mouth. He means that they did not say anything, as no one could say anything if his tongue truly had become stuck in this way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they did not say anything”
29:11	j883		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֤י	1	Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said in the preceding verses that these various groups of people kept silent when he arrived at the city gate. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “They all kept silent because”
29:11	n94l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֹ֣זֶן שָׁ֭מְעָה וַֽ⁠תְּאַשְּׁרֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is using one part of each of these community members, his **ear**, to mean all of him in the act of hearing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they heard me and they blessed me”
29:11	j884		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֹ֣זֶן שָׁ֭מְעָה	1	If you decide to retain the term **ear** in your translation to mean hearing, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of that word, since Job is speaking about many people. Alternate translation: “their ears heard”
29:11	j885		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠תְּאַשְּׁרֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job means implicitly that the people **blessed** him for giving such wise, godly counsel. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and they blessed me for giving such wise, godly counsel”
29:11	t3tu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עַ֥יִן רָ֝אֲתָ֗ה וַ⁠תְּעִידֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the term **eye** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and when they perceived that the advice I had given was wise, they attested that I had said the right thing”
29:11	j886		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠עַ֥יִן רָ֝אֲתָ֗ה	1	If you decide to retain the term **ear** in your translation to mean hearing, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of that word, since Job is speaking about many people. Alternate translation: “and their eyes saw”
29:12	j887		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עָנִ֣י & וְ֝⁠יָת֗וֹם & לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the adjectives **afflicted** and **fatherless** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “poor people who were … and fatherless people … to them”
29:12	amrf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עָנִ֣י	1	The term **afflicted** may seem like a passive verbal form, but it is actually an adjective. It indicates people who are suffering from affliction, not people whom others have afflicted. However, if your language does not use passive verbal forms, it may be more natural to express this idea with a term other than “afflicted.” Alternate translation: “people who were suffering from affliction”
29:13	ui1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בִּרְכַּ֣ת אֹ֭בֵד עָלַ֣⁠י תָּבֹ֑א וְ⁠לֵ֖ב אַלְמָנָ֣ה אַרְנִֽן	1	Job is not referring to a specific person who was **perishing** or to a specific **widow**. He means those types of people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “The blessing of people who were perishing came upon me, and I gladdened the hearts of widows”
29:13	qs27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בִּרְכַּ֣ת אֹ֭בֵד עָלַ֣⁠י תָּבֹ֑א	1	Job is speaking of the **blessing** that he received from someone who was **perishing** as if it were a living thing that could come **upon** him.

Alternate translation: “and I made widows rejoice” or “and I gave widows reason to rejoice”
29:14	j888		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	צֶ֣דֶק לָ֭בַשְׁתִּי וַ⁠יִּלְבָּשֵׁ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is repeating the verb **clothed** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “I wrapped righteousness all around me”
29:14	r9i7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	צֶ֣דֶק לָ֭בַשְׁתִּי וַ⁠יִּלְבָּשֵׁ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if he literally **clothed** himself with **righteousness** during the time that he is describing. In this context, the image of clothing represents the character of a person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I was very careful to practice righteousness”
29:14	j889		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	צֶ֣דֶק לָ֭בַשְׁתִּי וַ⁠יִּלְבָּשֵׁ֑⁠נִי	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I was very careful to be righteous in my dealings with people”
29:14	rc4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כִּֽ⁠מְעִ֥יל וְ֝⁠צָנִ֗יף מִשְׁפָּטִֽ⁠י	1	In this comparison, clothing once again represents the character of a person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I was also careful to make sure that people received justice”
29:14	qe3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מִשְׁפָּטִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe not **justice** that he received but just decisions that he helped the city leaders make. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the just decisions that I helped the city leaders make were”
29:15	z9qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עֵינַ֣יִם הָ֭יִיתִי לַֽ⁠עִוֵּ֑ר וְ⁠רַגְלַ֖יִם לַ⁠פִּסֵּ֣חַ אָֽנִי	1	Job is speaking as if he had literally been **eyes** and **feet** that other people needed. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I saw and read things to help people who could not see, and I went places on behalf of people who could not go to those places themselves”
29:15	qwg2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לַֽ⁠עִוֵּ֑ר & לַ⁠פִּסֵּ֣חַ	1	Job is using the adjectives **blind** and **lame** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “for blind people … for lame people”
29:16	dv24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָ֣ב & לָֽ⁠אֶבְיוֹנִ֑ים	1	Job is speaking as if he had literally been a **father** to **needy** people. He means that he fulfilled the role of a father by being a protector and advocate. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a protector of the needy” or “an advocate for the needy”
29:16	j890		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לָֽ⁠אֶבְיוֹנִ֑ים	1	Job is using the adjective **needy** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “to needy people”
29:16	j891		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠רִ֖ב לֹא־יָדַ֣עְתִּי אֶחְקְרֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Job is referring implicitly to a **case** whose details he did not **know** before someone brought it to the city gate for adjudication. Job did not know these details because he was not personally acquainted with the person bringing the case. So he was not motivated by friendship or family loyalty, but simply by the interests of justice. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and I made sure that each person got justice even if he was not a friend or relative of mine”
29:17	rxh7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 וָֽ֭⁠אֲשַׁבְּרָ⁠ה מְתַלְּע֣וֹת עַוָּ֑ל וּ֝⁠מִ⁠שִּׁנָּ֗י⁠ו אַשְׁלִ֥יךְ טָֽרֶף	1	Job is speaking as if an **unrighteous** person had been a wild animal that was holding a vulnerable person like captured **prey** in its **teeth** and as if he had broken the **jaws** of this animal so that they could no longer hold the vulnerable person, who would **drop** out to safety. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And when an unrighteous person had coerced a vulnerable person into an oppressive arrangement, I made the unrighteous person release the vulnerable person from that arrangement”
29:17	h48z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עַוָּ֑ל & וּ֝⁠מִ⁠שִּׁנָּ֗י⁠ו	1	Job is using the adjective **unrighteous** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “unrighteous people, and … from their teeth”
29:18	j892		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	 וָ֭⁠אֹמַר עִם־קִנִּ֣⁠י אֶגְוָ֑ע וְ֝⁠כַ⁠ח֗וֹל אַרְבֶּ֥ה יָמִֽים	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And I said that I would expire in my nest and that I would multiply days like sand”
29:18	j893		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	 וָ֭⁠אֹמַר עִם־קִנִּ֣⁠י אֶגְוָ֑ע וְ֝⁠כַ⁠ח֗וֹל אַרְבֶּ֥ה יָמִֽים	1	Since Job would live a long life before expiring, it might be more natural to put the second phrase before the first one. Alternate translation: “I will multiply days like sand, and then I will expire in my nest”
29:18	j894		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	אֶגְוָ֑ע	1	See how you translated the term **expire** in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “I will pass away”
29:18	mx7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עִם־קִנִּ֣⁠י	1	Job is speaking of his home as if it were literally a **nest** such as a bird would live in. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in my own home”
29:18	ree7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ֝⁠כַ⁠ח֗וֹל אַרְבֶּ֥ה יָמִֽים	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **sand** consists of a very large number of grains, so Job expected to live for a very large number of days. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “after I have lived for very many days” or “after I have lived for a long time”
29:19	j895		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	שָׁרְשִׁ֣⁠י פָת֣וּחַ אֱלֵי־מָ֑יִם וְ֝⁠טַ֗ל יָלִ֥ין בִּ⁠קְצִירִֽ⁠י	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation in a such way that there would not be a quotation within a quotation, you can continue doing that here. Alternate translation: “I said that my root was spread out to the waters and that the dew lodged on my branch”
29:19	f52q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שָׁרְשִׁ֣⁠י פָת֣וּחַ אֱלֵי־מָ֑יִם וְ֝⁠טַ֗ל יָלִ֥ין בִּ⁠קְצִירִֽ⁠י	1	Job spoke of himself in those days as if he were literally a tree that was healthy and flourishing because it was getting all the moisture that it required. Since Job is describing what he used to say, it may be good to retain this image in your translation, but if it would be more natural in your language, you could express it as a comparison. Alternate translation: “I said that I was like a tree that was healthy and flourishing because it was getting all the moisture that it required through roots that reached down to ground water and through dew that formed at night on its branches”
29:19	j896		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	שָׁרְשִׁ֣⁠י פָת֣וּחַ & בִּ⁠קְצִירִֽ⁠י	1	Since Job was speaking of many roots and branches, it may be more natural in your language to use plural forms here. Alternate translation: “My roots are spread out … on my branches”
29:19	j897		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠טַ֗ל יָלִ֥ין בִּ⁠קְצִירִֽ⁠י	1	Job was speaking as if the **dew** had been a traveler that had found lodging for the night on a **branch** of the tree that he was using to represent himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and dew forms at night on my branches”
29:20	j898		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כְּ֭בוֹדִ⁠י חָדָ֣שׁ עִמָּדִ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠קַשְׁתִּ֗⁠י בְּ⁠יָדִ֥⁠י תַחֲלִֽיף	1	If you have been translating this quotation in such a way that there is not a quotation within a quotation, you can continue doing that here. Alternate translation: “I said that my glory was fresh in me and that my bow sprouted in my hand”
29:20	j899		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּ֭בוֹדִ⁠י חָדָ֣שׁ עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	Job means implicitly that the **glory** or honor that he enjoys is always **fresh** because people keep honoring him in new ways. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “People keep honoring me in new ways”
29:20	bz9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠קַשְׁתִּ֗⁠י בְּ⁠יָדִ֥⁠י תַחֲלִֽיף	1	Job is speaking as if he had a **bow**, a weapon that he used with arrows, and that it grew freshly in his **hand** the way that a branch sprouts from a tree trunk. (Job uses the same verb for “sprout” in [14:7–9](../14/07.md) to describe a tree reviving and sending out shoots when moisture returns to the ground.) He means that the bow, which represents his strength, is lively and vigorous. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I stay vigorously strong”
29:21	j901		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לִֽ⁠י־שָׁמְע֥וּ וְ⁠יִחֵ֑לּוּ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “Because people were waiting to hear what I would say, they listened to me”
29:21	j900		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	שָׁמְע֥וּ	1	**They** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. (As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Job continues to use the pronoun “they” with this same indefinite sense through to the end of the chapter.) If it would be helpful in your language, here and in the following verses you could translate the term with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “People listened”
29:22	j902		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַחֲרֵ֣י דְ֭בָרִ⁠י	1	Job is using the term **word** to mean what he said by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “After I had spoken”
29:22	l3t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠עָלֵ֗י⁠מוֹ תִּטֹּ֥ף מִלָּתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his speech literally **dripped**, that is, fell in drops, on his listeners. He means that it was refreshing and invigorating to them, like gentle rain. This enabled them to recognize that he was giving sound advice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for what I said was refreshing to them”
29:23	g4bi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠יִֽחֲל֣וּ כַ⁠מָּטָ֣ר לִ֑⁠י	1	The point of this comparison is that just as people are eager for rain to fall and water their crops, so Job’s listeners were eager to hear him speak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “And people as waited eagerly to hear me speak as they wait for rain to fall on their crops”
29:23	dye5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠פִי⁠הֶ֗ם פָּעֲר֥וּ לְ⁠מַלְקֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is using a complex image here. First, he is speaking as if the people listening to him were literally the ground. Second, he is speaking of the ground soaking up rainfall as if it were opening its **mouth** to drink water. Job does not mean that the people opened their mouths to speak; he is actually describing them listening. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Yes, they were eager to listen to everything I said, just as the dry ground soaks up the latter rain when it falls”
29:23	v5kv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לְ⁠מַלְקֽוֹשׁ	1	In the region where the book of Job was composed, people would plant crops in the fall. Rain at that time would help the crops start growing. But farmers depended on later rains, which would fall in the spring after an interval during which little rain fell, to enable the crops grow to maturity. Express this in a way that would be meaningful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as for the rain that falls again after the dry season”
29:24	j903		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֶשְׂחַ֣ק אֲ֭לֵ⁠הֶם לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֑ינוּ	1	The pronouns **them** and **they** refer to people who were in desperate situations and did not **believe** that they would get justice or receive help. Alternate translation: “I smiled on people who felt desperate and hopeless”
29:24	vxz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֶשְׂחַ֣ק אֲ֭לֵ⁠הֶם לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֑ינוּ	1	Job is describing one thing he did to encourage despondent people, he **smiled on them**, to mean all that he did to encourage them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I encouraged people who felt desperate and hopeless”
29:24	b3dw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠א֥וֹר פָּ֝נַ֗⁠י לֹ֣א יַפִּילֽוּ⁠ן	1	Job is speaking as if there had been light shining from his face. He is describing a cheerful facial expression that indicated hope and a favorable disposition. Job is also using a further characteristic image for facial expressions. In this culture, people would say that someone “lifted up” his face if he made a cheerful expression but that his face “fell” if he made a gloomy expression. Job means that he did not let the situations of the people he wanted to help discourage him. Job is combining the two images and saying that they did not cause the light of his face to fall. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different image that has this meaning or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I did not let their situations discourage me”
29:25	azd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	 אֶֽבֲחַ֣ר דַּרְכָּ⁠ם֮ וְ⁠אֵשֵׁ֪ב רֹ֥אשׁ	1	Since Job **chose** the **way** for the people of his community because he was their **chief**, it might be more natural to reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “I sat as a chief and I chose their way”
29:25	nhm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶֽבֲחַ֣ר דַּרְכָּ⁠ם֮	1	Job is speaking of what he determined his community should do as if that were a **way** or path for the people to walk along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I guided them about the right things to do”
29:25	gh9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֵשֵׁ֪ב רֹ֥אשׁ	1	Job is describing how he held the position of a **chief** by association with the way he **sat** in a place reserved for such a leader. (He refers similarly to “my seat” in verse 7.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I was their chief”
29:25	dv86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ֭⁠אֶשְׁכּוֹן כְּ⁠מֶ֣לֶךְ בַּ⁠גְּד֑וּד	1	In this culture, kings would accompany their armies into the field as their commanders. The point of this comparison is probably that just as the authority of a **king** would be unquestioned within his **army**, so people did not question Job’s directions as their leader. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and everyone respected my authority”
29:25	nmq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר אֲבֵלִ֣ים יְנַחֵֽם	1	Job makes this further comparison to specify that he led the community gently and in its own best interests. He did not exercise his authority in an arbitrary, despotic way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “but I was gentle and encouraging as a leader”
30:intro	u96h				0	# Job 30 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Job’s final response to his three friends.\n- Verses 1–14: Job describes the disrespect he now experiences because he has suffered so many misfortunes\n- Verses 15–19: Job describes his sufferings\n- Verses 20–23: Job addresses God directly to complain that God has not helped him\n- Verses 34–31: Job describes how he is suffering even though he helped others when they suffered\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Reference of “they” in verses 2–10\n\nIn verses 2–10, Job uses the pronouns “they,” “them,” and “their” to mean the young men who now treat him disrespectfully. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could specify this reference at regular intervals for clarity. Various notes suggest ways to do that. (In verse 5, as a note will clarify, one instance of “they” refers to other people.)
30:1	bw8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	צְעִירִ֥ים מִמֶּ֗⁠נִּי לְ⁠יָ֫מִ֥ים	1	Job is using the adjective phrase **fewer in days** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. (He is contrasting his present situation, in which younger people now disrespect him, with the way that “young men” formerly withdrew respectfully from his presence and “old men” stood up out of respect for him, as he described in [29:8](../29/08.md).) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “those who are much younger than I am”
30:1	ghr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁר־מָאַ֥סְתִּי אֲבוֹתָ֑⁠ם לָ֝⁠שִׁ֗ית עִם־כַּלְבֵ֥י צֹאנִֽ⁠י	1	The implications of this statement is that the **fathers** of the young men who now **laugh at** Job were shiftless and incompetent. This could mean: (1) that Job would not employ these men to do even such menial tasks as shepherd **dogs** do. Alternate translation: “whose fathers I could not even employ to do menial tasks” (2) that Job would not specifically employ these men as shepherds for his flocks, working with his sheepdogs. Alternate translation: “whose fathers I would not even employ as shepherds”
30:2	dkd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כֹּ֣חַ יְ֭דֵי⁠הֶם לָ֣⁠מָּה לִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I have no use for the strength of their hands!” or “the strength of their hands is useless to me!”
30:2	j904		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כֹּ֣חַ יְ֭דֵי⁠הֶם לָ֣⁠מָּה לִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of these young men, their **hands**, to mean all of them in the act of using **strength** to work. As the rest of the verse indicates, these young men have only feeble strength. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have no use for their feeble strength!” or “their feeble strength is useless to me!”
30:2	n58x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	עָ֝לֵ֗י⁠מוֹ אָ֣בַד כָּֽלַח	1	Job is speaking of **old age** as if it were a living thing that has **perished** in these young men. Eliphaz uses the same term for “old age” in 5:26. There it means the maturity and accomplishment that come from a long life well lived. Here the term seems to indicate the vigor that someone would have in his youth that would enable him to live such a long life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They have lost the vigor that would have enabled them to live a long life” or “They have lost their youthful vigor”
30:2	b5gi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עָ֝לֵ֗י⁠מוֹ 	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the pronoun **them** refers to the young men who now treat Job disrespectfully, as do the pronouns “they,” “them,” and “their” in verses 4–10. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “In these young men”
30:3	j6n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַֽ⁠עֹרְקִ֥ים צִיָּ֑ה	1	Job is speaking of the **dry land** by association to mean the roots that grow in the land, as the next verse makes clear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These young men gnaw on the roots that they find in the ground”
30:3	j905		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	צִיָּ֑ה אֶ֝֗מֶשׁ שׁוֹאָ֥ה וּ⁠מְשֹׁאָֽה	1	The term **yesterday** could mean: (1) time gone by. Alternate translation: “the land that has long been dry, a waste and desolation” (2) the darkness of the night that precedes day. Alternate translation: “the dry land in the gloom of waste and desolation”
30:3	i6mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	שׁוֹאָ֥ה וּ⁠מְשֹׁאָֽה	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **desolation** tells what kind of **waste** this is. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “in a desolate wasteland”
30:4	lbt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מַלּ֣וּחַ	1	The word **mallow** describes a kind of flowering plant whose leaves are edible. Your language may have a name of its own for this plant that you could use in your translation. If your readers would not be familiar with the plant, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “desert plants”
30:4	dz4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠שֹׁ֖רֶשׁ רְתָמִ֣ים לַ⁠חְמָֽ⁠ם	1	Since Job is speaking of many roots, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **root**. Alternate translation: “and the roots of broom trees are their bread”
30:4	j906		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	רְתָמִ֣ים	1	A **broom** tree is a kind of shrub that grows in desert areas. If your readers would not be familiar with this shrub, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable one that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “shrubs”
30:4	c9mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לַ⁠חְמָֽ⁠ם	1	Job is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. While the roots of the **broom** tree are edible, they have a bitter taste, and only a desperate person would eat them. So there is a sense here that the people whom Job is describing eat these roots out of desperation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is their food” or “is all they have to eat”
30:5	k9yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יְגֹרָ֑שׁוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “People drive these young men out”
30:5	j907		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִן־גֵּ֥ו	1	Job means implicitly that these young men are **driven out** from the **midst** of human community. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “from society”
30:5	j908		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָרִ֥יעוּ עָ֝לֵ֗י⁠מוֹ	1	Here the pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. It means the people of society in general. (The pronoun **them** refers to the young men whom Job has been describing.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “people shout after these young men”
30:5	lwr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠גַּנָּֽב	1	Job is speaking of people chasing others away, so this seems to be a reference to people shouting at a would-be **thief** in order to call attention to him and get him to flee before he steals something. Job is probably not referring to people shouting to get others to pursue and apprehend a thief who has already stolen something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “as they would shout to chase away a would-be thief”
30:6	f7j8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לִ⁠שְׁכֹּ֑ן	1	This phrase indicates the result of what Job describes in the previous verse, “They are driven out from the midst.” It may be helpful to indicate that explicitly, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As a result, they have to live”
30:6	j909		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בַּ⁠עֲר֣וּץ נְחָלִ֣ים	1	Since Job is speaking of the slopes of many **wadis**, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **slope**. Alternate translation: “on the slopes of wadis”
30:6	j910		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	חֹרֵ֖י עָפָ֣ר	1	Job is using one part of the ground, the **dust** on its surface, to mean the ground itself. **Iron** is actually **taken** from deep in the ground. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in holes in the ground”
30:7	kkv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִנְהָ֑קוּ	1	Job is speaking as if these young men literally **bray** as if they were donkeys. He likely means that they moan with hunger, as wild animals cry out when they need food. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “these young men moan with hunger”
30:7	dmg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יְסֻפָּֽחוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “they gather together”
30:8	juk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְּֽנֵי־נָ֭בָל גַּם־בְּנֵ֣י בְלִי־שֵׁ֑ם	1	Job is not referring to a specific **fool** or person **without a name**. He means such people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express these meanings by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “Sons of fools, indeed, sons of people without names”
30:8	h66q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	בְּֽנֵי־נָ֭בָל גַּם־בְּנֵ֣י בְלִי־שֵׁ֑ם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be helpful to your readers. However, you might also leave the words out in order to show the force of this exclamation, with which Job concludes his description of these young men. Alternate translation: “These young men are sons of fools! Indeed, they are sons of people without names”
30:8	i8tx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּֽנֵי־נָ֭בָל גַּם־בְּנֵ֣י בְלִי־שֵׁ֑ם	1	In this context, the expression **sons of** describes people who share the qualities of something. Job is using this expression to describe the behavior and character of these young men. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. The word **fool** here does not indicate someone who lacks intelligence or education; it means someone who chooses to disobey God, thinking there will be no consequences. The word **name** here means a good reputation. Alternate translation: “People who foolishly think they can disobey God! No wonder they are people of no reputation”
30:8	wl4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִ֝כְּא֗וּ מִן־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “People scourge them from the land”
30:8	r31i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נִ֝כְּא֗וּ מִן־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Job is using one means by which authorities might drive such young men out of the community, by scourging (whipping) them, to mean all of the ways in which they would drive them out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They are driven from the land” or “People drive them from the land”
30:9	v6wt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נְגִינָתָ֣⁠ם	1	Job means implicitly that these young men are singing about him disrespectfully. Your language may have a term that you could use to indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “the subject of their taunt-song”
30:9	u5hm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֱהִ֖י לָ⁠הֶ֣ם לְ⁠מִלָּֽה	1	The meaning of the term **word** here is the same as the meaning of the term “saying” in [17:6](../17/06.md). Job means that these young men are citing him by name as an outstanding example of someone who seemed to be prospering because he was righteous but who came to ruin because he was actually wicked. Your language may have an expression for this practice of citing people by name as examples, and you may be able to use that expression in your translation. See how you translated the term “saying” in [17:6](../17/06.md).
30:10	j911		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	רָ֣חֲקוּ מֶ֑⁠נִּי	1	Staying **away from** Job, that is, not approaching him or speaking with him, was a symbolic action that conveyed disrespect and disapproval. Even though physically it was the same thing that young men formerly did to show respect for Job, discreetly withdrawing from his presence, now it had the opposite meaning. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “they stay away from me to show their disapproval” or “they shun me”
30:10	sx1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠פָּנַ֗⁠י לֹא־חָ֥שְׂכוּ רֹֽק	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **withhold**. Alternate translation: “but they spit in my face”
30:10	j912		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠פָּנַ֗⁠י לֹא־חָ֥שְׂכוּ רֹֽק	1	Spitting in Job’s face was a symbolic action that showed contempt for him as someone who was presumably a sinner. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. See how you translated the similar expression in [17:6](../17/06.md). Alternate translation: “but they spit contemptuously in my face”
30:10	j913		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠פָּנַ֗⁠י לֹא־חָ֥שְׂכוּ רֹֽק	1	Job does not mean that these young men **spit** at him from a distance, even though he says that they **stay away** from him. He means that when they must unavoidably pass near him, they use the occasion to spit in his face. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but they spit contemptuously in my face when they pass by”
30:11	j914		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	פִ֭תַּח & שִׁלֵּֽחוּ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God, and the pronoun **they** refers to the young men whom Job has been describing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God has loosed … these young men cast away”
30:11	r95h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִתְרִ֣י פִ֭תַּח	1	Job is speaking as if God has in some way literally **loosed** a **cord** that belongs to him or pertains to him. This could mean: (1) that God has loosened the bowstring on a bow that belongs to Job, so that the bow is no longer useful. The bow would represent Job’s strength. Alternate translation: “he has taken away my strength” (2) that God has released a cord that was holding up the tent in which Job lived, so that the tent has collapsed. The tent would represent Job’s life. Alternate translation: “he has ruined my life”
30:11	sq6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠רֶ֗סֶן & שִׁלֵּֽחוּ	1	Job is speaking as if **restraint** were literally an object that people could **cast away**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so they act without restraint”
30:11	pll3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פָּנַ֥⁠י	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “in my presence”
30:12	j915		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עַל־יָמִין֮ פִּרְחַ֪ח יָ֫ק֥וּמוּ	1	Job is using the adjective **right** as a noun to mean his right side. Your language may also use adjectives this way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “On my right side the brood arise”
30:12	z8g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־יָמִין֮ פִּרְחַ֪ח יָ֫ק֥וּמוּ	1	The right side was usually the most dangerous side on which to approach an enemy soldier, since a majority of soldiers were right-handed and would use their right hands and arms to wield their swords. The implication is that these young men have no fear of what Job might do to them. Alternate translation: “Without fear the brood arise”
30:12	u9wm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פִּרְחַ֪ח	1	Job is speaking of these young men as if they were the **brood** of a bird or animal. The image is of a cluster of immature offspring moving agitatedly about. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “the rabble”
30:12	l5wg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	רַגְלַ֥⁠י שִׁלֵּ֑חוּ	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **foot**, to mean all of him in the act of walking. He probably means that as he is walking on the road, when these young men are approaching from the opposite direction, they do not stand respectfully aside so that he can pass. Instead, they shove him out of the way so that they can pass. When young men traveling in the same direction overtake him, they similarly push him aside so that they can go by. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on the roads, they push me out of the way”
30:12	j916		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יָּסֹ֥לּוּ עָ֝לַ֗⁠י אָרְח֥וֹת אֵידָֽ⁠ם	1	Job is speaking of siege mounds by association with the way that they provide **roads** or ways for attacking armies to get into cities and cause their **destruction**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they build siege mounds against me”
30:12	tdu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יָּסֹ֥לּוּ עָ֝לַ֗⁠י אָרְח֥וֹת אֵידָֽ⁠ם	1	Job is speaking as if he were a city and these young men were literally building siege mounds in order to conquer that city. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they look for ways to attack me”
30:13	sv3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נָתְס֗וּ נְֽתִיבָ֫תִ֥⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if there were literally a **path** that he could take to escape from the attacks of these young men and that they are destroying it so that Job cannot use it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They prevent me from escaping”
30:13	x9pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠הַוָּתִ֥⁠י יֹעִ֑ילוּ	1	Job is speaking as if **calamity** were literally an object that these young men could move forward, farther along its route to a destination. He means that in addition to all the bad things that have happened to him, they do further bad things to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they add to my sufferings”
30:13	ayx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹ֖א עֹזֵ֣ר לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	This could mean: (1) that they do despicable things to Job that no decent person would join them in doing. Alternate translation: “they do things to me that no decent person would do” (2) that they are contemptible people. This may be a popular expression indicating that. Alternate translation: “they are contemptible people”
30:14	b1fx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כְּ⁠פֶ֣רֶץ רָחָ֣ב יֶאֱתָ֑יוּ תַּ֥חַת שֹׁ֝אָ֗ה הִתְגַּלְגָּֽלוּ	1	Job is continuing the image of himself as a city and these young men as a besieging army. He is describing an attack in full force: The army has made a **wide breach** in the city wall and the soldiers are pouring through it. Job says within this image that they **roll on**, perhaps like waves of the sea, one wave after another. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “These young men attack me without restraint, time and time again”
30:15	su3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הָהְפַּ֥ךְ עָלַ֗⁠י בַּלָּ֫ה֥וֹת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The word **Terrors** could indicate: (1) things that create fear or terror. Alternate translation: “Terrible things keep happening to me” (2) terrors or fears themselves. Alternate translation: “I have many fears”
30:15	j917		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תִּרְדֹּ֣ף & נְדִבָתִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking of these **Terrors** as if they were living things that could **pursue** him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “each one deprives me of dignity”
30:15	y58l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כָּ֭⁠רוּחַ	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a strong wind relentlessly drives away light objects, so the **Terrors** that Job is experiencing are relentlessly depriving him of dignity. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “relentlessly”
30:15	qzd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וּ֝⁠כְ⁠עָ֗ב עָבְרָ֥ה יְשֻׁעָתִֽ⁠י	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **cloud** fades from the sky, so all hope of **deliverance** has faded for Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and I no longer have any hope of deliverance”
30:15	j918		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠כְ⁠עָ֗ב עָבְרָ֥ה יְשֻׁעָתִֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **deliverance**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I no longer have any hope that someone will deliver me”
30:16	vq4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עָ֭לַ⁠י תִּשְׁתַּפֵּ֣ךְ נַפְשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his **life** were a liquid that was being poured out of a container so that soon none of it would be left in the container. (Although the verb is reflexive, it has a passive sense; Job is not saying, within this image, that his life is doing this on its own initiative.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life is ebbing away within me”
30:16	yd79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יֹ֭אחֲז֣וּ⁠נִי יְמֵי־עֹֽנִי	1	Job is speaking of these **days** as if they were living things that could **seize** him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am continually experiencing days of affliction”
30:16	j919		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יְמֵי־עֹֽנִי	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **affliction**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “days during which I am afflicted”
30:17	j920		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לַ֗יְלָה עֲ֭צָמַ⁠י נִקַּ֣ר	1	Job is speaking of **Night** as if it were a living thing that could pierce his **bones**. He is doing this to describe the pain that he feels more keenly at night. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “At night, pain pierces my bones”
30:17	j921		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לַ֗יְלָה עֲ֭צָמַ⁠י נִקַּ֣ר	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **bones**, to mean all of him in the act of feeling pain. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “At night, pain pierces my body”
30:17	s5h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ֗יְלָה עֲ֭צָמַ⁠י נִקַּ֣ר	1	Job is speaking as if pain were literally piercing his body or putting holes in it. He means that he gets a stabbing sensation of pain as if he were actually being stabbed. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “At night, I have stabbing sensations of pain”
30:17	j922		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מֵ⁠עָלָ֑⁠י	1	It is not entirely clear what Job means by this expression. He uses the same expression in [30:30](../30/30.md) to describe how his skin, darkened by disease, is peeling off. So this could be a reference to the pain from his sores radiating deep into his body. Alternate translation: “from the sores on my skin”
30:17	q849		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠עֹרְקַ֗⁠י לֹ֣א יִשְׁכָּבֽוּ⁠ן	1	Job is speaking of the pains he is suffering as if they were living things that could be **gnawing** him and could **rest** (although they do not). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the pain is like someone chewing on me, and it never stops”
30:18	x296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠רָב־כֹּ֭חַ	1	Job is referring implicitly to the **great force** of his skin disease, its power to do so much damage. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Because of my serious disease,”
30:18	wpi4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 יִתְחַפֵּ֣שׂ לְבוּשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is probably speaking of his skin as if it were his **clothing**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my skin is changed” or “my skin is disfigured”
30:18	j923		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כְּ⁠פִ֖י כֻתָּנְתִּ֣⁠י יַֽאַזְרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	The pronoun **it** refers to Job’s skin disease. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my skin disease binds me like the collar of my tunic”
30:18	tm94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כְּ⁠פִ֖י כֻתָּנְתִּ֣⁠י יַֽאַזְרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if his disease were literally binding him, or wrapping him up tightly, the way a person in his culture would put on a **tunic** and then wrap its **collar** tightly around his neck. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my skin disease afflicts me continually”
30:19	j924		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֹרָ֥⁠נִי לַ⁠חֹ֑מֶר	1	The pronoun **He** refers to text. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God has thrown me into the mud”
30:19	aa4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֹרָ֥⁠נִי לַ⁠חֹ֑מֶר	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **thrown** him into **mud**. This could mean: (1) that Job is using the image of being **thrown** into **mud** to represent his loss of position and status. Alternate translation: “God has reduced me to meager circumstances” (2) that Job is referring to the way he has been demonstrating his distress by sitting in the midst of the ash pile outside the city, as [2:8](../02/08.md) describes. Alternate translation: “God has caused me such distress that I have been sitting in this ash heap”
30:19	m43k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וָ֝⁠אֶתְמַשֵּׁ֗ל כֶּ⁠עָפָ֥ר וָ⁠אֵֽפֶר	1	Job is speaking as if he had literally become like **dust** and **ashes**. This could be: (1) a physical description. Job may mean that the dust and ashes from the pile where he is sitting have stuck to his skin because of his oozing sores and so now he physically resembles dust and ashes himself. Job describes the appearance of his body in the previous verse, and this could be a continuation of that description. Alternate translation: “and I now appear to have become dust and ashes” (2) a comparison. Job may be saying that in some way his situation resembles some characteristic of **dust and ashes**, perhaps their lowliness of being on the ground. Alternate translation: “and I am greatly humiliated”
30:20	j925		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	עָ֝מַ֗דְתִּי	1	Standing up was a symbolic action by which someone in this community would call attention to the fact that they needed help. Job may mean that he does this literally as an appeal to God for help, or he may be speaking as if he does it when actually he appeals for help in some other way, such as by praying, as he describes in the first part of the verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “I stand to get your attention and appeal for help”
30:20	k1ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּתְבֹּ֥נֶן בִּֽ⁠י	1	Job means implicitly that God does nothing but **gaze** at him without helping him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but you only look at me and do not help me”
30:21	xk2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠עֹ֖צֶם יָדְ⁠ךָ֣	1	Here, God’s **hand** represents his power. Job is using this possessive form to describe how God’s **strength** is characterized by power, that is, God’s strength is very great. Alternate translation: “with your great strength”
30:22	zy94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּשָּׂאֵ֣⁠נִי אֶל־ר֭וּחַ תַּרְכִּיבֵ֑⁠נִי וּ֝⁠תְמֹגְגֵ֗⁠נִי תּוּשִׁיָּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God uses the wind to **lift** him off the ground and as if the wind carries him away as if he were riding on it the way a person would **ride** a horse. He is also speaking as if God uses a **storm** to **toss** him about. He means that God is causing him such great distress that he feels as if these things are happening to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You are causing me such great distress that it feels as if a storm wind is picking me up, carrying me away, and tossing me about”
30:23	j926		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מָ֣וֶת & וּ⁠בֵ֖ית מוֹעֵ֣ד לְ⁠כָל־חָֽי	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that by using a word other than “and” in your translation. Alternate translation: “to death, yes, to the house of appointment to all the living”
30:23	py4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מָ֣וֶת	1	As the rest of the verse shows, Job is using the term **death** by association to mean Sheol, the abode of the dead. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to Sheol”
30:23	a3ym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בֵ֖ית מוֹעֵ֣ד לְ⁠כָל־חָֽי	1	Job is speaking as if Sheol were a **house** in which dead people lived. He means that it is the place to which people go when they die. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and to the place of appointment to all the living”
30:23	j927		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וּ⁠בֵ֖ית מוֹעֵ֣ד לְ⁠כָל־חָֽי	1	Job is using this possessive form to indicate that God has appointed Sheol as the place where living people are to go when they die. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and to the place God has appointed for living people to go when they die”
30:23	nf6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָֽי	1	Job is using the adjective **living** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “living people”
30:24	s7pp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לֹא־בְ֭⁠עִי יִשְׁלַח־יָ֑ד אִם־בְּ֝⁠פִיד֗⁠וֹ לָהֶ֥ן & שֽׁוּעַ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “one in a heap certainly stretches out a hand! He certainly cries out because he is in trouble!”
30:24	j928		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	לֹא־בְ֭⁠עִי יִשְׁלַח־יָ֑ד	1	Job is using a hypothetical situation as an example and applying it by implication to his own situation. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “if someone is in a heap of ruins, then he certainly stretches out a hand, and in the same way I am calling to you for help.”
30:24	giv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לֹא־בְ֭⁠עִי יִשְׁלַח־יָ֑ד	1	Reaching out with one’s **hand** when in a desperate situation is a symbolic action that constitutes an appeal for help. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “does not one in a heap of ruins appeal for help”
30:24	ly2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־בְּ֝⁠פִיד֗⁠וֹ לָהֶ֥ן שֽׁוּעַ	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I certainly wept for the difficult of day!”
30:25	j930		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לִ⁠קְשֵׁה־י֑וֹם	1	Job is using the adjective phrase **difficult of day** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. (In this phrase, the word **day** indicates a time, and the possessive form indicates that this time was characterized by difficulty.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “for people who were going through difficult times”
30:25	j932		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָֽגְמָ֥ה נַ֝פְשִׁ֗⁠י לָ⁠אֶבְיֽוֹן	1	Job is suggesting implicitly that since he helped others who were in trouble, it is only fair for him to ask God for help now that he is in trouble himself. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “My soul grieved for the needy, so it is only fair for me to ask you for help now”
30:25	j931		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עָֽגְמָ֥ה נַ֝פְשִׁ֗⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him in the act of grieving sympathetically.

30:26	n1jn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ֝⁠א֗וֹר וַ⁠יָּ֥בֹא אֹֽפֶל	1	Job is speaking as if helpful things were literally **light** and harmful things were literally **darkness**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for helpful things, but harmful things happen instead”
30:27	r36u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֵעַ֖⁠י רֻתְּח֥וּ וְ⁠לֹא־דָ֗מּוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “My innards are boiling and they do not rest”
30:27	j934		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מֵעַ֖⁠י רֻתְּח֥וּ וְ⁠לֹא־דָ֗מּוּ	1	Job is speaking as if his **innards** have literally **boiled** and that they are literally not taking any opportunity to **rest**. This could mean: (1) that his abdomen continually has a hot, painful sensation because he is very upset and this has affected his digestion. Alternate translation: “My stomach is continually upset” (2) that he continually has feelings, which he is using his **innards** to represent, of anger and frustration. Alternate translation: “I continually feel anger and frustration”
30:27	u2gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	קִדְּמֻ֥⁠נִי יְמֵי־עֹֽנִי	1	Job is speaking of the difficult **days** he is experiencing as if they were living things that could **confront** him. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “I am facing day after day of affliction” or “I am experiencing day after day of affliction”
30:28	fj2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קֹדֵ֣ר הִ֭לַּכְתִּי בְּ⁠לֹ֣א חַמָּ֑ה	1	Job means that his skin disease, **not** the **sun**, has darkened his skin, as he says explicitly in verse 30. The implication is that this darkened skin makes him appear as if he is a manual laborer who works out in the sun. [Song of Songs 1:6](../sng/01/06.md) suggests that in this culture, a person in that situation would be less respected than someone who could employ others to do outdoor work and so did not have sun-darkened skin. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “My disease-darkened skin makes me appear to be a manual laborer”
30:28	i5gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קַ֖מְתִּי בַ⁠קָּהָ֣ל אֲשַׁוֵּֽעַ	1	Job may be implicitly indicating a further loss of dignity here. He has had to appeal for help in a public place where people gather. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have had to humiliate myself by appealing for help in public”
30:29	f66b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָ֭ח הָיִ֣יתִי לְ⁠תַנִּ֑ים וְ֝⁠רֵ֗עַ לִ⁠בְנ֥וֹת יַעֲנָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if he had literally become a **brother** to **jackals** and a **companion** to ostriches. These wild dogs and wild birds live in deserted areas, and Job is suggesting that they are now his only relatives and friends, since he has become an outcast. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have become such an outcast that it is as if I live far away from other people”
30:29	j935		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠בְנ֥וֹת יַעֲנָֽה	1	In this context, the expression **daughters of** describes creatures that share the qualities of something. The word **clamor** is one possible meaning of an uncertain term that interpreters suggest could also mean “greed” or “the desert.” Whatever the meaning of that term, interpreters agree that the reference is to ostriches. If your language can refer to this kind of bird with a descriptive phrase rather than with a name, you could use that phrase in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “to ostriches”
30:29	jsv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לִ⁠בְנ֥וֹת יַעֲנָֽה	1	An ostrich is a large, heavy bird that cannot fly but can run very fast. If your readers would not be familiar with ostriches, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “to large, flightless, desert birds”
30:30	j936		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ע֭וֹרִ⁠י שָׁחַ֣ר מֵ⁠עָלָ֑⁠י	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “My skin has turned black and it is falling off from upon me”
30:30	udu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עַצְמִ⁠י־חָ֝֗רָה מִנִּי־חֹֽרֶב	1	Job is using one part of himself, a **bone**, to mean all of him in the act of feeling hot. He is likely referring to the **heat** of fever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my body is hot with fever”
30:31	qj9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י לְ֭⁠אֵבֶל כִּנֹּרִ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠עֻגָבִ֗⁠י לְ⁠ק֣וֹל בֹּכִֽים	1	Job is using musical instruments, the **harp** and the **flute**, to represent happiness, by association with the way that people play music when they are happy. He is using **mourning** and **the sound of weeping** to represent sorrow, since people mourn and weep when they are sad. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “So while I used to be joyful, now I am very sorrowful”
31:intro	leq9				0	# Job 31 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the conclusion of Job’s final response to his three friends.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 1–34 and 38–40, Job swears a series of oaths to insist on his innocence. Typically he uses a statement that begins with “if” to suggest something he might have done wrong, and he then uses a statement that uses verbal forms such as “may” or “let” to wish that he would receive an appropriate punishment if he has indeed committed such a sin. In some cases, rather than wish for punishment, Job gives a reason why he would not have committed the sin he has described. In some other cases, Job makes only the “if” statement, leaving the rest of the conditional statement to be inferred. Notes throughout the chapter indicate how Job responds to each of the “if” statements that he makes.\n\nA series of similar statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could help them appreciate it by putting each sentence of the litany on a separate line. See what you did with the similar litanies in chapters 9, 12, 26, and 29. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany and rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula)\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Job’s understanding of appropriate punishment for sin\n\nIn this chapter, Job insists that he has been righteous by wishing aloud that he would receive the just punishment for any crimes that he may have committed. In most cases, Job himself would suffer the punishment that he describes. But in verses 9 and 10, Job says that if he has committed adultery with another man’s wife, then may other men have sexual relations with his wife. It seems that Job is wishing that God would punish his wife for something that he himself had done. Since the book describes Job as a wise and righteous, it appears that readers are supposed to consider that this would be a just punishment, but it does not seem to be just or fair. One way to understand this may be to consider that Job is saying that if he has been unfaithful to his wife, then may his wife be unfaithful to him in return. This is not the ideal that the Bible as a whole teaches. As Christians, we are not supposed to take revenge on others by doing to them what they have done to us. But in this specific context, in which Job is swearing oaths to guarantee his innocence, having his wife be unfaithful to him if he had been unfaithful to her would be a punishment that fit the crime, and Job is insisting on his innocence by saying that he is prepared to receive the punishments that fit any crimes he has committed.
31:1	af9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ֭רִית כָּרַ֣תִּי לְ⁠עֵינָ֑⁠י	1	In this culture, people would say that they had **cut** a **covenant** because making a covenant often involved a ceremony in which the two parties would cut up an animal and walk between the cut-up pieces. [Jeremiah 34:18](../34/18.md) refers to such a ceremony, and [Genesis 15:8–19](../01/01.md) describes God making a covenant with Abraham in this way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have made a covenant with my eyes”
31:1	ka6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בְּ֭רִית כָּרַ֣תִּי לְ⁠עֵינָ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking of his **eyes** as if they were living things with which he could make a **covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have resolved to exercise self-control regarding what I look at”
31:1	sxi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מָ֥ה אֶ֝תְבּוֹנֵ֗ן עַל־בְּתוּלָֽה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I would not gaze upon a virgin!”
31:1	j937		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מָ֥ה אֶ֝תְבּוֹנֵ֗ן	1	Job means implicitly that he would not **gaze** lustfully. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “how then would I gaze lustfully” or “I would not gaze lustfully”
31:1	j938		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עַל־בְּתוּלָֽה	1	Job is using one kind of woman, a **virgin**, to mean women in general. He is not saying that if a woman had not had sexual relations with anyone, he would not look at her lustfully, but if a woman had had sexual relations, then he might look at her lustfully. Job is mentioning a virgin as one example of a woman whom he might be tempted to look at that way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at a woman”
31:2	ygr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מֶ֤ה ׀ חֵ֣לֶק אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְֽ⁠נַחֲלַ֥ת שַׁ֝דַּ֗י מִ⁠מְּרֹמִֽים	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This could mean: (1) a good **portion** and **inheritance** as a reward for obedience. These terms typically have a positive meaning. Alternate translation: “For then there would be no portion from God above or inheritance from the Almighty in the heights!” (2) a bad **portion** and **inheritance**, that is, a punishment, for disobedience. This would mean the same thing that Job says in the next verse. Alternate translation: “For then the portion from God above would not be good, nor the inheritance from the Almighty in the heights”
31:2	p7x8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֵ֣לֶק אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְֽ⁠נַחֲלַ֥ת שַׁ֝דַּ֗י מִ⁠מְּרֹמִֽים	1	Depending on the meaning (see previous note), Job is speaking as if either a reward or punishment from God would literally be a **portion** or a share in an **inheritance**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: (1) “the reward from God above, or the blessing from the Almighty” or (2) “the punishment from God above, or the chastisement from the Almighty”
31:2	j939		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְֽ⁠נַחֲלַ֥ת	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “or what would be the inheritance”
31:2	j940		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	מִ⁠מְּרֹמִֽים	1	See how you translated this same expression in [25:1](../25/02.md). Alternate translation: “in highest heaven”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “After all, calamity is for the unrighteous, and disaster for doers of wickedness!”
31:3	j942		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לְ⁠עַוָּ֑ל	1	Job is using the adjective **unrighteous** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “for unrighteous people”
31:3	j943		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠פֹ֣עֲלֵי אָֽוֶן	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wickedness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for people who do wicked things”
31:4	j944		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־ה֭וּא יִרְאֶ֣ה דְרָכָ֑⁠י וְֽ⁠כָל־צְעָדַ֥⁠י יִסְפּֽוֹר	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Certainly God sees my ways and counts all my steps!”
31:4	vf6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דְרָכָ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking of how he has been living as if that were a series of **ways** or paths that he has been walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “how I have been living”
31:4	n2eh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְֽ⁠כָל־צְעָדַ֥⁠י יִסְפּֽוֹר	1	Within the image of life as a series of paths, Job is speaking as if God would literally **count** each of the **steps** he was taking. By **steps**, he probably means individual actions, and by **count**, he probably means that God notices each one specifically. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and take note of each of my actions”
31:5	zdh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אִם־הָלַ֥כְתִּי עִם־שָׁ֑וְא	1	Job is speaking of **falsehood** as if it were a living thing with which he could have **walked**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If I have conducted myself with falsehood”
31:5	j945		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִם־הָלַ֥כְתִּי עִם־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **falsehood**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “If I have conducted myself dishonestly”
31:5	a5st		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠תַּ֖חַשׁ עַל־מִרְמָ֣ה רַגְלִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **foot**, to mean all of him in the act of hurrying or being eager to do something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or I have hurried to deceit”
31:5	j946		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠תַּ֖חַשׁ עַל־מִרְמָ֣ה רַגְלִֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **deceit**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “or I have eagerly done something deceitful”
31:6	j947		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	יִשְׁקְלֵ֥⁠נִי בְ⁠מֹאזְנֵי־צֶ֑דֶק וְ⁠יֵדַ֥ע אֱ֝ל֗וֹהַּ תֻּמָּתִֽ⁠י	1	In this verse, Job interrupts the if-then statement he is making in verses 5, 7, and 8. He does that in order to assert that if God judges him fairly, then God will recognize that he does not deserve the punishment he describes in verse 8 or any of the other punishments he describes in this chapter. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this assertion before the if-then statement by creating a verse bridge for verses 5–6. It might say something like this: “Now if God would weigh me in balances of righteousness, then he would know my integrity. If I have walked with falsehood or my foot has hurried to deceit”
31:6	ndj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִשְׁקְלֵ֥⁠נִי בְ⁠מֹאזְנֵי־צֶ֑דֶק	1	Job is speaking as if God might literally **weigh** him in a set of **balances**.

31:6	j948		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יִשְׁקְלֵ֥⁠נִי בְ⁠מֹאזְנֵי־צֶ֑דֶק	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “let him judge me in a way that is right”
31:6	j949		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	תֻּמָּתִֽ⁠י	1	See how you translated the term **integrity** in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “that I live in the right way”
31:7	fm8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אִ֥ם תִּטֶּ֣ה אַשֻּׁרִ⁠י֮ מִנִּ֪י הַ֫⁠דָּ֥רֶךְ	1	Job is using one part of himself, a **step** that he would take, to mean all of him in the act of walking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I have turned aside from the way”
31:7	j950		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִ֥ם תִּטֶּ֣ה אַשֻּׁרִ⁠י֮ מִנִּ֪י הַ֫⁠דָּ֥רֶךְ	1	Job is speaking of the right manner in which to live as if it were a **way** or path that people should walk along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I have failed to live correctly”
31:7	j951		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לִבִּ֑⁠י & מֻאֽוּם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “if my heart … if a spot”
31:7	r29i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠אַחַ֣ר עֵ֭ינַ⁠י הָלַ֣ךְ לִבִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking of his **heart** and his **eyes** as if they were living things that could go places, the eyes going somewhere first and the heart following. Here Job is using his **heart** to mean his desires and his **eyes** to mean what he sees. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or if I have seen something that did not belong to me but I have coveted it for myself”
31:7	tvw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 וּ֝⁠בְ⁠כַפַּ֗⁠י דָּ֣בַק מֻאֽוּם	1	As in [17:9](../17/09.md), Job is speaking as if people who are innocent of wrongdoing literally have clean **hands**, so that when he speaks of a **spot** or stain having **stuck** to his **hands**, he is raising the issue of whether he has done something wrong. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or I have done something morally wrong”
31:8	b7e8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶ֭זְרְעָה וְ⁠אַחֵ֣ר יֹאכֵ֑ל	1	Job means implicitly that if he has done any of the wrong things he has just listed, then the appropriate punishment would be for someone else to **eat** the crops that grew from seeds he would **sow**. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “may someone else eat the crops that grow from the seeds that I sow”
31:9	j952		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־נִפְתָּ֣ה לִ֭בִּ⁠י עַל־אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	When Job speaks of whether his **heart** has been **opened** by a **woman**, he is using an expression that means to be enticed by a woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If my heart has been enticed by a woman”
31:9	p1yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אִם־נִפְתָּ֣ה לִ֭בִּ⁠י עַל־אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **heart**, meaning his desires, to mean all of him in the act of being enticed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If I have been enticed by a woman”
31:9	j953		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אִם־נִפְתָּ֣ה לִ֭בִּ⁠י עַל־אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. However, be careful to translate Job’s meaning accurately. Job is not describing a situation in which a woman would be essentially responsible for seducing him. He is describing a situation in which he would not have exercised self-control over what he looked at (as described in verse 1) and in which he allowed the beauty of a woman to entice him to do something he knew was wrong. Alternate translation: “If I have allowed a woman to entice me”
31:9	rs8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַל־פֶּ֖תַח רֵעִ֣⁠י אָרָֽבְתִּי	1	The implication is that this **woman** is married and that Job would have waited in hiding outside her **door** for her to open the door and let him come into her home and have sexual relations with her at a time when her husband was away. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and I have waited for my neighbor’s wife to let me into her home so that I could have sexual relations with her”
31:10	ngk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תִּטְחַ֣ן לְ⁠אַחֵ֣ר אִשְׁתִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the term **grind**, meaning to grind grain, by association to mean “be a concubine,” since concubines did the work of grinding grain for their masters, who were also their husbands. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See the General Notes to this chapter for a further discussion of this verse. Alternate translation: “may my wife become the concubine of another man”
31:10	j954		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠עָלֶ֗י⁠הָ יִכְרְע֥וּ⁠ן אֲחֵרִֽין	1	Job is using the phrase **bow down upon** to mean “have sexual relations with.” This is mild way of referring to something that is usually done in private. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and may others sleep with her”
31:11	ds7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כִּי־הִ֥יא & זִמָּ֑ה	1	The pronoun **that** refers to what Job described in verse 9, not to what he described in verse 10. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “For if I had sexual relations with another man’s wife, that would be lewdness”
31:11	h8zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ֝ה֗וּא & עָוֺ֥ן פְּלִילִֽים	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe **iniquity** that **judges** would punish, not iniquity that judges would commit. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and judges would certainly punish such iniquity”
31:12	j955		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֤י	1	Job is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he would not commit adultery, not the reason why judges would punish adultery. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “I would not commit adultery, because I know that”
31:12	j956		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֵ֣שׁ הִ֭יא	1	The pronoun **it** refers to adultery. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “adultery is a fire”
31:12	r4vn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֵ֣שׁ הִ֭יא	1	Job is speaking as if adultery were literally a **fire**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it is very destructive”
31:12	i923		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־אֲבַדּ֣וֹן תֹּאכֵ֑ל	1	Job is speaking of the **fire** that he is using to represent adultery as if it burns everything in its path right down to the underworld. As a note to [26:6](../01/01.md) explains, the word **Abaddon** is another name for Sheol. However, the word literally means “destruction,” and Job may be using it in that sense, even within the image of this fire. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it burns until everything before it is completely destroyed”
31:12	bn97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠בְ⁠כָל־תְּב֖וּאָתִ֣⁠י תְשָׁרֵֽשׁand it would uproot all of my harvest	1	Job is also speaking as if adultery were something that would **uproot** his entire **harvest**. He is probably using this image to represent the loss of all of his possessions. [Proverbs 6:26–35](../06/26.md) indicates that in this culture, men found guilty of adultery could have to pay great amounts in fines and compensation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and it could cost me all of my possessions” or “and it could make me lose all of my wealth”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “then I would not be able to do anything if God arose, or if he visited, I would not be able to answer him”
31:14	j958		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָק֣וּם אֵ֑ל	1	Job is asking implicitly what he would do if God **arose** or stood up to bring charges against him. As a note to [20:27](../20/27.md) explains, in order to begin a case against someone, people in this culture would stand up among those who had gathered in the public square. See how you translated the similar expression in [20:27](../20/27.md). Alternate translation: “God stood up to bring charges against me”
31:14	j959		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠כִֽי־יִ֝פְקֹ֗ד	1	Job is using the term **visited** in a particular sense. When applied to God, the term often indicates that God takes action in the life of a person or group, whether to help needy people or to punish guilty people. For example, [Ruth 1:6](../01/06.md) says that Naomi, who had left Israel because of a famine, returned there after she heard that “Yahweh had visited his people, giving them bread.” Here the sense is that God would “visit” Job to help Job’s servants and to punish him for mistreating them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or if he came to help my servants”
31:15	jl2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲֽ֝⁠לֹא־בַ֭⁠בֶּטֶן עֹשֵׂ֣⁠נִי עָשָׂ֑⁠הוּ וַ֝⁠יְכֻנֶ֗⁠נּוּ בָּ⁠רֶ֥חֶם אֶחָֽד	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “After all, the one who made me in the belly also made him. Indeed, the same person fashioned us both in the womb.”
31:15	j960		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	עָשָׂ֑⁠הוּ	1	Although the pronoun **him** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that refers both to the “male servant” and “female servant” whom he describes in verse 13. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an expression in your language that would indicate this. Alternate translation: “Did … make my male servant and my female servant” or “Did … make them”
31:15	j961		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	וַ֝⁠יְכֻנֶ֗⁠נּוּ & אֶחָֽד	1	By **us**, Job means himself and his servants but not the friends to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
31:16	yzr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מֵ⁠חֵ֣פֶץ דַּלִּ֑ים	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe something that the **poor** would **desire**. The sense is that they would desire this because they needed it. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “something that the poor desired” or “something that the poor needed”
31:16	j962		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	דַּלִּ֑ים	1	Job is using the adjective **poor** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “poor people”
31:16	e9r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֖י אַלְמָנָ֣ה אֲכַלֶּֽה	1	Job is using one part of this **widow**, her **eyes**, to mean all of her in the act of looking for help, that is, expecting and awaiting help. If her eyes were to **fail**, that would mean that she had given up hope of receiving the help she needed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or if I have neglected to help a widow for so long that she gave up hope of receiving help”
31:16	j963		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אַלְמָנָ֣ה	1	Job is not referring to a specific **widow**. He means any widow who might have needed help. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using an indefinite article. Alternate translation: “a widow”
31:17	gs2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	יָת֣וֹם	1	Job is using the adjective **fatherless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the fatherless person” or “the orphan”
31:17	j964		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	יָת֣וֹם	1	Job is not referring to a specific **fatherless** person. He means any orphan who might have needed food. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “any orphan who might have needed food”
31:18	ibm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֣י	1	Job is using the word **for** to introduce the reason why he does not even need to specify a consequence in this case if he has committed the sins he has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “but I do not even need to say what God should do to me if I have done those things, because”
31:18	z518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	מִ֭⁠נְּעוּרַ⁠י & וּ⁠מִ⁠בֶּ֖טֶן אִמִּ֣⁠י	1	Job says **from my youth** and **from the belly of my mother** as overstatements for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “throughout my life … and continually”
31:18	xz2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	גְּדֵלַ֣⁠נִי & אַנְחֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the representative orphan whom Job described in the verse 17, and the pronoun **her** refers to the representative widow he described in verse 16. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the orphan has grown up with me … I have guided the widow”
31:19	j965		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לָ⁠אֶבְיֽוֹן	1	Job is using the adjective **needy** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “for a needy person”
31:19	j966		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לָ⁠אֶבְיֽוֹן	1	Job is not referring to a specific **needy** person. He means any person who might have needed a **covering**, probably meaning an outer garment that would also have served as a blanket. You could indicate in your translation whom Job means if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “for any person who needed one”
31:20	j967		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אִם־לֹ֣א בֵרֲכ֣וּ⁠נִי חֲלָצָ֑יו וּ⁠מִ⁠גֵּ֥ז כְּ֝בָשַׂ⁠י יִתְחַמָּֽם	1	Since this representative needy person may have first **warmed himself** with a garment that Job provided and then **blessed** Job for this practical help, it may be more natural to reverse the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “if he has not warmed himself from the wool of my sheep and blessed me for my kindness”
31:20	ut9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אִם־לֹ֣א בֵרֲכ֣וּ⁠נִי חֲלָצָ֑יו	1	Job is using one part of this representative needy person, his **loins**, to mean all of him in the act of blessing Job. Job probably chooses the waist area to symbolize this person because that is the area that a person who needed clothing would cover first. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if he has not blessed me”
31:20	r66u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠מִ⁠גֵּ֥ז כְּ֝בָשַׂ⁠י	1	Job is using this phrase by association to mean a garment that someone in his household would have woven from **wool** that his **sheep** had produced. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and … with a warm woolen garment that I provided”
31:21	mf7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	אִם־הֲנִיפ֣וֹתִי עַל־יָת֣וֹם יָדִ֑⁠י	1	Shaking the **hand**, probably formed into a fist, **against** someone would be a symbolic action that threatened harm if the person did not acquiesce to one’s wishes. In this context, it would be a gesture that threatened severe consequences if an opponent in court did not agree to settle a case on favorable terms. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “if I have tried to intimidate the fatherless into settling a case in my favor”
31:21	w7s9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶרְאֶ֥ה בַ֝⁠שַּׁ֗עַר עֶזְרָתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the term **gate** by association to mean the community court, which would hold its sessions in the public square near the city gate. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I saw that there were people in court who would take my side”
31:22	sqk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ֝⁠אֶזְרֹעִ֗⁠י מִ⁠קָּנָ֥⁠ה תִשָּׁבֵֽר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “yes, may my arm break off from its socket”
31:23	ss4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֤י	1	Job is using the word **For** to reassert the reason why he did not commit any of the crimes he has been describing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “No, I did not do any of those things, because”
31:23	j968		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אֵ֣יד אֵ֑ל	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe the **destruction** of a wicked person by **God**, not the destruction of God by anything. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the knowledge that God destroys wicked people”
31:23	j969		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠שְּׂאֵת֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א אוּכָֽל	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Job is referring to neglecting the poor and intimidating the fatherless, as he described in verses 19–21. Alternate translation: “and because of his majesty, I was not able to do any of those things” or “and because of his majesty, I could not have done any of those things”
31:24	j970		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ֝⁠לַ⁠כֶּ֗תֶם אָמַ֥רְתִּי מִבְטַחִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and I have told fine gold that it was my confidence”
31:24	s4sm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	וְ֝⁠לַ⁠כֶּ֗תֶם אָמַ֥רְתִּי מִבְטַחִֽ⁠י	1	If Job had spoken to **fine gold** in this way, he would have been speaking to something that he knew could not hear him in order to show in a strong way how he felt about it. If a speaker in your language would not do that, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I have said that fine gold was my confidence”
31:24	r6lg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ֝⁠לַ⁠כֶּ֗תֶם אָמַ֥רְתִּי מִבְטַחִֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **confidence**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I have said that I was confiding in fine gold”
31:25	sk1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	וְ⁠כִֽי־כַ֝בִּ֗יר מָצְאָ֥ה יָדִֽ⁠י	1	In this instance, Job is swearing an oath by stating the first part of a condition (“if”) but not the second part (“then”). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explicitly state the implied second part of this condition. You could use the same language that Job uses in verses 11 and 28, or you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “and because my hand had acquired much, then judges would certainly punish such iniquity” or “and because my hand had acquired much, then I would certainly deserve punishment”
31:25	bt3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כַ֝בִּ֗יר מָצְאָ֥ה יָדִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of acquiring wealth.

31:25	j971		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	כַ֝בִּ֗יר	1	Job is using the adjective **much** as a noun to mean wealth in quantity. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a fortune”
31:26	j972		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	א֖וֹר	1	Job is using the term **light** by association to mean the sun. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the sun”
31:26	m93p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠יָרֵ֗חַ & הֹלֵֽךְ	1	Job is speaking as if the **moon** were literally **walking** across the sky. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or the moon moving across the sky”
31:27	qcf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֣פְתְּ & לִבִּ֑⁠י	1	See how you translated the similar expression about the “heart” being “opened” in [31:9](../31/09.md). Alternate translation: “and I was attracted to the sun or the moon”
31:27	wm2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠תִּשַּׁ֖ק יָדִ֣⁠י לְ⁠פִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his **hand** were a living thing that could have **kissed** his **mouth**. He means that if he had wanted to offer worship to the sun or the moon, following the customs of this culture, he would have touched his hand to his mouth in a kiss and then waved the kiss up to the sun or the moon. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “and I had blown a kiss to the sun or the moon” or “and I had worshiped the sun or the moon”
31:28	pwl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	גַּם־ה֭וּא עָוֺ֣ן פְּלִילִ֑י	1	See how you translated the expression **iniquity of judges** in [31:11](../31/11.md). Alternate translation: “judges would certainly also punish such iniquity”
31:29	b1im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠הִתְעֹרַ֗רְתִּי	1	This expression means to consider oneself in a better position than another who has suffered a misfortune. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or gloated”
31:29	p1nt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	כִּֽי־מְצָ֥א⁠וֹ רָֽע	1	Job is speaking of **evil** as if it were a living thing that could have **found** someone who hated him. Here the word **evil** has the sense of “misfortune” rather than of moral wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because he suffered misfortune”
31:29	hvt5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	כִּֽי־מְצָ֥א⁠וֹ רָֽע	1	This is the conclusion of an oath that Job is swearing in this verse. See what you did in [31:25](../31/25.md), where Job similarly does not state the second part of the condition in an oath that he is swearing. Alternate translation: “because evil found him, then judges would certainly punish such iniquity” or “because evil found him, then I would certainly deserve punishment”
31:30	w93c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹא־נָתַ֣תִּי לַ⁠חֲטֹ֣א חִכִּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his **palate** or mouth were a living thing that he could have caused to **sin**. He means that he himself could have sinned in something that he said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “For I have not said something sinful”
31:31	j973		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	אִם־לֹ֣א אָ֭מְרוּ מְתֵ֣י אָהֳלִ֑⁠י מִֽי־יִתֵּ֥ן מִ֝⁠בְּשָׂר֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א נִשְׂבָּֽע	1	As in [31:25](../31/25.md) and [31:29](../31/29.md), here Job does not state the second part of the condition in an oath that he is swearing. See what you did in those verses. Alternate translation: “If the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who will give one who has not been satisfied from his flesh?’ then judges would certainly punish such iniquity” or “If the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who will give one {who} has not been satisfied from his flesh?’ then I would certainly deserve punishment”
31:31	j974		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אִם־לֹ֣א אָ֭מְרוּ מְתֵ֣י אָהֳלִ֑⁠י מִֽי־יִתֵּ֥ן מִ֝⁠בְּשָׂר֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א נִשְׂבָּֽע	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “If the men of my tent have not asked who could show one who has not been satisfied from my flesh!”
31:31	ng3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מְתֵ֣י אָהֳלִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the term **tent** by association to mean his household. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the men of my household”
31:31	j975		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	מְתֵ֣י אָהֳלִ֑⁠י	1	Although Job refers to his male and female servants separately in [31:13](../31/13.md), Job is likely using the masculine term **men** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “the men and women of my household” or “my servants”
31:31	hwl9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֥ן מִ֝⁠בְּשָׂר֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א נִשְׂבָּֽע	1	Job’s servants would be using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. (In this context, unlike elsewhere in the book, the expression **Who will give** does not express a wish. The servants are not saying, “We wish there was one who has not been satisfied.”) Alternate translation: “No one can show anyone who has not been satisfied from his flesh!” or, positively, “Everyone has been satisfied from his flesh!”
31:31	j976		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֣א נִשְׂבָּֽע	1	As the next verse shows, Job’s servants would be speaking implicitly of hungry people. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “a hungry person who has not been satisfied”
31:31	j977		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ֝⁠בְּשָׂר֗⁠וֹ	1	Job’s servants would be using the term **flesh** by association to mean meat and, by further association, food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from his food”
31:32	p6kk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	בַּ֭⁠חוּץ לֹא־יָלִ֣ין גֵּ֑ר	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative phrase **stayed overnight in the outdoors**. Alternate translation: “I have allowed the sojourner to stay in my home”
31:32	uns3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לֹא־יָלִ֣ין גֵּ֑ר & לָ⁠אֹ֥רַח	1	Job is not referring to a specific **sojourner** or to a specific **traveler**. He means sojourners and travelers in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “Sojourners have not stayed overnight … to travelers”
31:32	h895		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	דְּ֝לָתַ֗⁠י לָ⁠אֹ֥רַח אֶפְתָּֽח	1	Job is using one thing he would do to provide hospitality, open his **doors**, to mean the entire act of providing hospitality. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have provided hospitality to travelers”
31:33	jav4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כְ⁠אָדָ֣ם	1	The word translated **man** could mean: (1) even though it is masculine, humanity in general, including both men and women. Alternate translation: “as people do” (2) Adam, the first man whom God created and who tried to hide from God when he realized that he had sinned. (However, many interpreters question whether Job would have been familiar with the book of Genesis.) Alternate translation: “like Adam”
31:33	sb1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּסִּ֣יתִי & פְּשָׁעָ֑⁠י לִ⁠טְמ֖וֹן בְּ⁠חֻבִּ֣⁠י עֲוֺֽנִ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if **guilt** were an object that he could **hide** in his chest. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “I have concealed the guilt of my sins by keeping it inside” or “I have concealed my sins by not telling anyone about what I was guilty of doing”
31:34	b8ml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹא־אֵ֥צֵא פָֽתַח	1	Job is using a thing he would do to confess his sins publicly, **go out the door**, to mean the entire act of making a public confession. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I did not confess my sin publicly”
31:34	ia4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	לֹא־אֵ֥צֵא פָֽתַח	1	This is the conclusion of an oath that Job is swearing in this verse. See what you did in [31:25](../31/25.md), where Job similarly does not state the second part of the condition in an oath that he is swearing. Alternate translation: “I did not go out the door, then judges would certainly punish such iniquity” or “I did not go out the door, then I would certainly deserve punishment”
31:35	i9lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ֤י יִתֶּן־לִ֨⁠י ׀ שֹׁ֘מֵ֤עַֽ לִ֗⁠י	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: “I wish that I had someone who was hearing me!”
31:35	v1vp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֹׁ֘מֵ֤עַֽ לִ֗⁠י	1	By **one hearing me**, Job implicitly means someone impartial “hearing” his case in the judicial sense and judging it. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “someone impartial who will judge between me and God”
31:35	vmt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֶן־תָּ֭וִ⁠י	1	It appears that in this culture, both parties in a legal proceeding would submit their arguments to the court in writing and that they would sign them with their names or with a **mark** to authenticate them. Job is speaking as if he is putting his mark on a written record of his testimony in order to declare that everything he has just said is true. (It seems unlikely that he has actually put all of his testimony in writing, since this is not an actual court proceeding and God would not be submitting a corresponding written document.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I certify that I have been telling the truth”
31:35	u84z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠סֵ֥פֶר כָּ֝תַ֗ב אִ֣ישׁ רִיבִֽ⁠י	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: “And who will give to me the scroll that the man of my case has written?” or “And I wish that I had the scroll that the man of my case has written!”
31:35	qku3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֣ישׁ רִיבִֽ⁠י	1	This expression refers to an opponent in a legal proceeding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my opponent”
31:36	j978		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־לֹ֣א עַל־שִׁ֭כְמִ⁠י אֶשָּׂאֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “I would bear it on my shoulder, would I not?”
31:36	j979		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־לֹ֣א עַל־שִׁ֭כְמִ⁠י אֶשָּׂאֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I would certainly bear it on my shoulder!”
31:36	gw5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־לֹ֣א עַל־שִׁ֭כְמִ⁠י אֶשָּׂאֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Job is speaking as if he would literally **bear** his opponent’s written legal argument against him on his **shoulder**. He means that he would have no reason to be ashamed of any of the accusations, knowing that they would be proven false and his honor would be vindicated. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “I would wear it as a badge of honor!”
31:36	j980		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶֽעֶנְדֶ֖⁠נּוּ עֲטָר֣וֹת לִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the plural form **crowns** to refer to a crown of superlative quality. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “I would wear it on my head as a splendid crown” or “I would wrap it around my head as a splendid garland”
31:37	l5p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	צְ֭עָדַ⁠י	1	Job is speaking of his actions as if they were **steps** along a path that he had been walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my actions”
31:37	mvd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּמוֹ־נָ֝גִ֗יד	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **noble** does things confidently and with self-assurance because of his position, so Job would **approach** the Almighty confidently, knowing that he was innocent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “confidently”
31:38	r91t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אִם־עָ֭לַ⁠י אַדְמָתִ֣⁠י תִזְעָ֑ק וְ֝⁠יַ֗חַד תְּלָמֶ֥י⁠הָ יִבְכָּיֽוּ⁠ן	1	Job is speaking of the **soil** on his land and its **furrows** as if they were living things that could cry out for justice and **weep** because of oppression. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, in light of what Job says in the next verse. Alternate translation: “If I have committed a sin in the way that I have used my land”
31:39	j981		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְלִי־כָ֑סֶף	1	Job is using the term **silver** by association to mean money, since silver was used as money in this culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without paying for it”
31:39	vfe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠נֶ֖פֶשׁ בְּעָלֶ֣י⁠הָ הִפָּֽחְתִּי	1	This could mean: (1) that as a poetic way of referring to death, Job is speaking of how someone might **expire** or breathe out **breath**. He would mean implicitly that he had not even left the people who were farming his land enough crops to live on. Alternate translation: “or caused its masters to die of starvation” (2) that Job had grieved the people who were farming his land by oppressing them, though he had not actually caused them to die. The word translated **breath** can also mean “soul,” and the word translated **expire** could mean “sigh.” In that case Job would be using the souls of these farmers to mean the farmers themselves. Alternate translation: “or caused the souls of its masters to sigh” or “or caused its masters to sigh from oppression”
31:39	j982		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּעָלֶ֣י⁠הָ	1	In this context, the term **masters** describes people who are farming the land, not people who own it. It could refer to people who were tenants of land that Job owned. In that case, they would likely be sharecropping, that is, growing crops on Job’s land in exchange for giving him a share of the crops. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “its tenants” or “its sharecroppers” or “the people who were farming it”

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “may a thorn grow instead of wheat, and may a weed grow instead of barley”
31:40	j983		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	תַּ֤חַת חִטָּ֨ה ׀ יֵ֥צֵא ח֗וֹחַ וְ⁠תַֽחַת־שְׂעֹרָ֥ה בָאְשָׁ֑ה	1	Job is not referring to a specific **thorn** or to a specific **weed**. He means thorns and weeds in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “may thorns grow instead of wheat, and may weeds grow instead of barley”
31:40	j984		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תַּ֝֗מּוּ דִּבְרֵ֥י אִיּֽוֹב	1	The narrator is using the term **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words.

32:intro	pq4v				0	# Job 32 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces a younger man named Elihu, who has been listening to the conversation between Job and his three friends. Elihu explains that he waited for the friends to speak first, out of respect for their age. But since they have not been able to answer Job effectively, he would now like to speak himself. Elihu continues to speak through chapter 37.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines 32:6–22 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because those verses are poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Reference of “you” and “your”\n\nIn verses 6 and 11–14, Elihu says “you” and “your” in order to refer to Job’s three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.\n\n### “words” meaning speaking or what a person says\n\nSeveral times in verses 11–18, Elihu uses the term “words” to mean speaking or what a person says by using words. The narrator also uses the term in that sense in verse 4. Notes suggest ways to translate the term “words” in these various individual contexts.
32:1	j985		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁלֹ֤שֶׁת הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֣ים הָ֭⁠אֵלֶּה	1	By **the three of these men**, the narrator implicitly means Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar.

32:1	k2f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינָֽי⁠ו	1	The narrator is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in his own perspective”

The narrator is speaking as if Elihu’s **nose** or anger could literally have **burned**. He means that Elihu became very angry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, became very angry. He became very angry against Job”
32:2	s11a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יִּ֤חַר	1	The narrator is using the word translated **Then** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.

If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation. You may wish to indicate in your translation, as the UST does, that Elihu had been listening as Job spoke with his three friends.
32:2	hxc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֱלִיה֣וּא & בַּרַכְאֵ֣ל & הַ⁠בּוּזִי֮ & רָ֥ם	1	The words **Elihu**, **Barakel**, and **Ram** are the names of men. **Buzite** is the name of the people group to which Elihu belonged.

32:3	j987		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ֝⁠יַּרְשִׁ֗יעוּ אֶת־אִיּֽוֹב	1	A marginal notation in traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible indicates that scribes changed this reading from “they had declared God wrong” to **they had declared Job wrong**. The scribes made this change in order to avoid the uncomfortable suggestion that God could be declared wrong. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Job’s three friends could say nothing further to answer him”
32:6	j990		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֤עַן & וַ⁠יֹּ֫אמַ֥ר	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, this phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, the person said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. See how you have been translating this expression. Alternate translation: “And … responded”
32:6	j991		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ֭⁠יָמִים	1	Elihu is using the term **days** to refer to his age. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in age”
32:6	jj95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֣ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is plural here because Elihu is addressing Job’s three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. He means that people who have lived for many days and years should do those things. Alternate translation: “Let people who have lived for many days speak; yes, let those who have lived for a multitude of years teach wisdom”
32:7	j993		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	חָכְמָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what is wise”

32:8	le8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בֶ⁠אֱנ֑וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Elihu is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

32:8	tg64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִשְׁמַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י תְּבִינֵֽ⁠ם	1	Elihu means implicitly that because the Almighty breathed life into humans, divinely bestowing on them the gift of life (the Bible presents this concept in [Genesis 2:7](../02/07.md)), humans have **understanding**, not just instinct as animals do.

This could mean: (1) that Elihu is now speaking to himself, but out loud, about the people to whom he had been speaking. He would be doing that to indicate in a strong way how he feels about those people. Alternate translation: “I am indignant that Job’s friends are dismayed and are no longer answering him and have nothing further to say to him” (2) that Elihu is now speaking about Job’s friends to others who are present. (It is unlikely that Elihu is turning to address Job himself here; Elihu begins addressing Job directly by name in [33:1](../33/01.md).) Alternate translation: “Look, all the rest of you, at how Job’s friends are dismayed and are no longer answering him and have nothing further to say to him!” Since Job’s friends can hear what Elihu is saying, and since he is saying it partly for their benefit, you could also continue to use the second person in your translation, as the UST does.

33:intro	t7rx				0	# Job 33 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu addresses Job directly. He invites Job to listen to him, summarizes what Job has said, and tells Job that he is wrong that God does not respond to people. Elihu says that God speaks to people in dreams to warn them not to keep sinning. He says that God also uses sickness to correct people. The implications are that Job’s sufferings are a warning from God not to sin; they are not a punishment from God for sins that Job has committed. In that sense, as Elihu says at the end of the chapter, Job has been right and his friends have been wrong about what has been happening to Job.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### ransom\n\nIn verse 24, Elihu describes how God may say of a person who is suffering because of his sin, “I have found a ransom.” The term “ransom” can describe a payment that is made in exchange for someone’s freedom. The term “redeem,” which Elihu uses earlier in that verse, can similarly mean to make a payment in order to have someone set free. However, in this context, the term “ransom” seems to describe instead a valuable consideration, not necessarily a monetary one, that provides the grounds for sparing someone from punishment. Be sure that it is clear in your translation of this verse that God is not saying that he is going to make a payment to someone else on behalf of the suffering person.\n\nA further implication seems to be that the person whom Elihu is describing has repented because of his sufferings after an interpreting angel has explained to him the change needed in his actions. This repentance shows that the person has responded positively to God’s initiatives to get him to stop living in the wrong way and to start living in the right way once again. Be sure that it is also clear in your translation of verse 24 that there is nothing that the person has done to redeem or ransom himself. As Elihu says, God “is gracious to him.” It is God who brings the sickness into the person’s life to “chasten” him, and it is God who sends the angel to warn and admonish the person, and so the person is spared from punishment through the actions of God.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “words” meaning speaking or what a person says\n\nAs in chapter 32, many times in this chapter Elihu uses the term “words” to mean speaking or what a person says by using words. Notes suggest ways to translate the term “words” in these various individual contexts.### reference of “you” and “your”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Elihu uses the pronouns “you” and “your” to address Job individually, so use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.\n\n### “man” and “men” with generic meaning\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Elihu uses the words “man” and “men” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Notes suggest translation possibilities at various places (see: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations).\n\n### “seals their correction” or “terrifies them with warnings” (verse 16)\n\nIn verse 16, the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “seals their correction.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “terrifies them with warnings,” and some translations say that. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
33:1	m7lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלָּ֑⁠י וְֽ⁠כָל־דְּבָרַ֥⁠י	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he wants to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I have to say … all that I tell you”
33:2	j572		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָ֭א פָּתַ֣חְתִּי פִ֑⁠י דִּבְּרָ֖ה לְשׁוֹנִ֣⁠י בְ⁠חִכִּֽ⁠י	1	Elihu is using the past tense to describe something that he intends to do in the immediate future. He is doing that in order to indicate his resolve to do what he describes. Alternate translation: “I am now about to open my mouth; my tongue is about to speak on my palate”
33:2	k006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	 נָ֭א פָּתַ֣חְתִּי פִ֑⁠י	1	Elihu is using the first part of the speaking process, opening one’s **mouth**, to mean the entire process of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am now about to speak”
33:2	k007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	דִּבְּרָ֖ה לְשׁוֹנִ֣⁠י בְ⁠חִכִּֽ⁠י	1	Elihu is speaking of his **tongue** as if it were a living thing that could speak on its own. He means that he is about to use his tongue to form words by touching it against his **palate** and other places in his mouth. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “the words are on the tip of my tongue”
33:3	k008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲמָרָ֑⁠י	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he plans to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will speak”
33:3	u1kk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֹֽשֶׁר־לִבִּ֥⁠י	1	Elihu is using his **heart** to represent his character. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the uprightness of my character”
33:3	k009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יֹֽשֶׁר־לִבִּ֥⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **uprightness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as someone whose character is upright”
33:3	j6sd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠דַ֥עַת שְׂ֝פָתַ֗⁠י בָּר֥וּר מִלֵּֽלוּ	1	Elihu is speaking of his **lips** as if they were living things that could **speak** on their own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I say will be pure knowledge”
33:4	g749		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	רֽוּחַ־אֵ֥ל עָשָׂ֑תְ⁠נִי וְ⁠נִשְׁמַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י תְּחַיֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	Elihu is reasserting the reason he gave in [32:8](../32/08.md) to account for how he will be able to speak knowledgably. See how you translated the similar expression there. Alternate translation: “I will be able to speak knowledgably because the Spirit of God made me; yes, it was the Almighty who breathed the breath of life into me”
33:5	ikf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עֶרְכָ֥⁠ה & הִתְיַצָּֽבָ⁠ה	1	Although they are used in other contexts as well, the words translated as **array** and **station** can have the sense of organizing troops into formations and placing them on a field of battle in order to defend a certain position. Elihu may be speaking as if Job’s words were troops that he wanted him to organize and as if Job himself were an army that should make a stand on a battlefield. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “marshal your arguments … draw up your defense” or “organize what you want to say … prepare to defend yourself”
33:5	k010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ֝⁠פָנַ֗⁠י	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “in my presence” or “to me personally”
33:6	dis8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲנִ֣י כְ⁠פִ֣י⁠ךָ לָ⁠אֵ֑ל	1	Elihu could be using the term **mouth** to mean: (1) what Job said when he wished that God would respond to him. Job said something like this in [31:35](../01/01.md) and in several other places earlier in his speeches. Alternate translation: “I will reply to you on behalf of God, as you wished” (2) Job himself. Elihu would be using part of Job, the part he has been using to pursue his case against God, to mean all of Job. If you follow this second interpretation in your translation, you may wish to put the sentence break at the end of the verse rather than in the middle of the verse, since the two halves of the verse would be parallel statements. Alternate translation: “I am just like you to God”
33:6	q828		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֵ֝⁠חֹ֗מֶר קֹרַ֥צְתִּי גַם־אָֽנִי	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God formed me too from clay”
33:6	ym3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מֵ֝⁠חֹ֗מֶר קֹרַ֥צְתִּי גַם־אָֽנִי	1	Elihu is speaking as if God had literally **formed** him from **clay**. He is indicating that he is only a mortal human being by alluding to the way that God originally formed humans from the dust of the earth. The Bible presents this concept in [Genesis 2:7](../02/07.md)). As the next verse makes clear, Elihu is reassuring Job that he does not have to be afraid of how he will respond to him, in contrast with the way Job said in [30:21–23](../30/21.md) and other places that he was afraid that God would respond to him violently and with great force. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am only a mortal human being”
33:7	dmb1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אֵ֭מָתִ⁠י	1	Elihu is using this possessive form to describe Job’s fear of him, not his own fear of something. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the fear of me”
33:7	y53l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠אַכְפִּ֗⁠י עָלֶ֥י⁠ךָ לֹא־יִכְבָּֽד	1	Elihu is speaking as if he might literally use his arms and hands to push down hard on Job and keep him from getting up, although he says that he will not do that. He means that he will not treat Job severely. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will not treat you severely”
33:8	zu7c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אָמַ֣רְתָּ בְ⁠אָזְנָ֑⁠י	1	Elihu is using the term **ears** by association to mean hearing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you have spoken in my hearing” or “you have spoken while I was listening”
33:8	c2f7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠ק֖וֹל מִלִּ֣ין אֶשְׁמָֽע	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what Job has said by using words. Elihu may be referring to the **sound** of the words to mean the exact words, that is, exactly what Job said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and this is exactly what I heard you say”
33:9	f62q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	זַ֥ךְ אֲנִ֗י בְּֽלִ֫י פָ֥שַׁע חַ֥ף אָנֹכִ֑י וְ⁠לֹ֖א עָוֺ֣ן לִֽ⁠י	1	In this verse and the next two verses, Elihu is telling what he heard Job say. You may wish to indicate that with an introductory phrase. While Elihu quotes many words and phrases directly from Job’s speeches (for example, Job described his prayer as “pure” in [16:17](../16/17.md)), this is a general summary, not a series of exact quotations. Nevertheless, you may wish to present verses 9–11 as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “You have said, ‘I am pure, without transgression; I am innocent, and I have no iniquity”
33:9	h3f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	זַ֥ךְ אֲנִ֗י בְּֽלִ֫י פָ֥שַׁע חַ֥ף אָנֹכִ֑י וְ⁠לֹ֖א עָוֺ֣ן לִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate verses 9–11 so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You have said that you are pure, without transgression; you have said that you are innocent and that you have no iniquity”
33:10	f8tf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	הֵ֣ן תְּ֭נוּאוֹת עָלַ֣⁠י יִמְצָ֑א יַחְשְׁבֵ֖⁠נִי לְ⁠אוֹיֵ֣ב לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is continuing to provide a general summary of what he heard Job say, directly quoting certain words and phrases. For example, Job asked God in [13:24](../13/24.md) why God considered him an enemy. If you decided to translate the previous verse as an indirect quotation, you can continue to do that here. Alternate translation: “You have said that God finds occasions against you and that he considers you to be his enemy”
33:11	w3ja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	יָשֵׂ֣ם בַּ⁠סַּ֣ד רַגְלָ֑⁠י יִ֝שְׁמֹ֗ר כָּל־אָרְחֹתָֽ⁠י	1	Elihu is continuing to provide a general summary of what he heard Job say. In this verse he quotes directly what Job said in [13:27](../13/27.md). If you decided to translate the previous two verses as an indirect quotation, you can continue to do that here. Alternate translation: “You have said that God puts your feet in shackles and that he watches all of your paths.’
33:11	ra4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָשֵׂ֣ם בַּ⁠סַּ֣ד רַגְלָ֑⁠י יִ֝שְׁמֹ֗ר כָּל־אָרְחֹתָֽ⁠י	1	Job spoke as if God had literally put his **feet** in **shackles** and as if his courses of action were literally **paths** that he was walking along. If you chose to express the ideas behind these images rather than the images themselves in [13:27](../13/27.md), you can do the same thing here so that it will be clear that Elihu is quoting what Job said there.
33:12	bbu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זֹ֣את	1	By **this**, Elihu seems to mean Job’s belief that God was not treating him fairly, which Elihu has just summarized. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in thinking that God is not treating you fairly,”
33:12	k011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	זֹ֣את לֹא־צָדַ֣קְתָּ & כִּֽי־יִרְבֶּ֥ה אֱ֝ל֗וֹהַ מֵ⁠אֱנֽוֹשׁ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could move this phrase to the start of the verse (after **Behold**), since it gives the reason why Elihu says that Job is **not right**. Alternate translation: “since God is greater than man, you have misunderstood how he is treating you”
33:12	k012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	מֵ⁠אֱנֽוֹשׁ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “than humans”
33:13	z74q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַ֭דּוּעַ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו רִיב֑וֹתָ כִּ֥י כָל־דְּ֝בָרָ֗י⁠ו לֹ֣א־יַעֲנֶֽה	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not contend against him, that he does not answer any of one’s words”
33:13	m749		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ֥י כָל־דְּ֝בָרָ֗י⁠ו לֹ֣א־יַעֲנֶֽה	1	Elihu could be saying: (1) that Job’s complaint is that God has not responded to his questions and protests. In that case, Elihu would be using the term translated **words** to mean what Job has been saying. Alternate translation: “that he does not respond when one speaks to him” (2) that God does not given an account for his own actions. The term translated **words** can also describe the matters with which someone is concerned or the things that someone does. Alternate translation: “that he does not account to anyone for how he treats that person”
33:13	k013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	כִּ֥י כָל־דְּ֝בָרָ֗י⁠ו לֹ֣א־יַעֲנֶֽה	1	Since Elihu is speaking to Job and he probably means that Job is complaining that God is not answering him, you could translate this in the second person if that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that does not answer any of your words” or “that he does not respond when you speak to him”
33:13	k014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	כִּ֥י כָל־דְּ֝בָרָ֗י⁠ו לֹ֣א־יַעֲנֶֽה	1	It may be more natural in your language to make this a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “saying, ‘He does not answer any of my words’” or “saying, ‘He does not respond when I speak to him’”
33:14	gyh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	בְ⁠אַחַ֥ת יְדַבֶּר־אֵ֑ל וּ֝⁠בִ⁠שְׁתַּ֗יִם	1	As Eliphaz did in [5:19](../05/19.md), here Elihu is naming a number that should be sufficient to illustrate his point and then increasing that number by one for emphasis. This was a common device in Hebrew poetry. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “God indeed speaks to people”
33:14	k015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	לֹ֣א יְשׁוּרֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	Elihu is drawing an implicit contrast between God’s genuine speaking and people’s failure to perceive it. You may wish to indicate this contrast explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “the only problem is, people do not perceive it”
33:15	zz7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠חֲל֤וֹם ׀ חֶזְי֬וֹן לַ֗יְלָה בִּ⁠נְפֹ֣ל תַּ֭רְדֵּמָה עַל־אֲנָשִׁ֑ים	1	Elihu is using two of the same phrases that Eliphaz used in [4:13](../01/01.md) in order to make a very similar point. The implication is that Elihu believes that Eliphaz was right to say what he did. Since Elihu is echoing Eliphaz implicitly, it would probably not be appropriate to add an explicit phrase to the text saying something like “as Eliphaz said,” but it may be helpful to translate the phrases here the same way you did in [4:13](../01/01.md).
33:15	vq5q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בִּ֝⁠תְנוּמ֗וֹת	1	Elihu is using the plural form **slumbers** in a context where the singular term “slumber” would suffice. This suggests that he is using the plural form for emphasis. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “in sound slumber”
33:16	k016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	יִ֭גְלֶה אֹ֣זֶן אֲנָשִׁ֑ים	1	Since Elihu is speaking of many people, if you retain the term **ear** in your translation, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of the word. Alternate translation: “God opens the ears of people”
33:16	cgu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִ֭גְלֶה אֹ֣זֶן אֲנָשִׁ֑ים	1	Elihu is using the term **ear** by association to mean hearing. When he says that God **opens** people’s ears, he means that God enables them to hear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God enables people to hear him speaking”
33:16	k017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִ֭גְלֶה אֹ֣זֶן אֲנָשִׁ֑ים	1	In this context, hearing represents understanding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God enables people to understand what he is saying to them”
33:16	k018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וּ⁠בְ⁠מֹ֖סָרָ֣⁠ם יַחְתֹּֽם	1	Elihu is using the possessive form **their correction** to describe the correction that God gives to people, not the correction that people give. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and seals the correction that he gives to them”
33:16	k019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְ⁠מֹ֖סָרָ֣⁠ם יַחְתֹּֽם	1	Elihu is speaking as if God literally placed a seal over the **correction** that he gave to people. He means that God preserves the value and influence of the correction. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and enables them to appreciate and benefit from the correction that he gives to them”
33:17	k020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ֭⁠הָסִיר אָדָ֣ם מַעֲשֶׂ֑ה	1	Elihu is speaking implicitly of a person **doing** something that was wrong. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to bring a person back from doing what is wrong”
33:17	qd6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ֭⁠הָסִיר אָדָ֣ם מַעֲשֶׂ֑ה	1	Elihu is speaking as if God would literally **bring** a person who was doing wrong **back** from a certain place. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to warn that person to stop doing what is wrong”
33:17	k021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠גֵוָ֖ה מִ⁠גֶּ֣בֶר יְכַסֶּֽה	1	Elihu is speaking as if **pride** were literally an object that God would **conceal** from a person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and to keep that person from becoming proud”
33:18	t4um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַחְשֹׂ֣ךְ נַ֭פְשׁ⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **He** refers to God, and the pronoun **his** refers to a person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God spares a person’s soul”
33:18	d93m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נַ֭פְשׁ⁠וֹ & וְ֝⁠חַיָּת֗⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is using parts of a person, his **soul** and his **life**, to mean all of him in the act of being spared from death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “him … and he spares him”
33:18	lgc1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	מֵ⁠עֲבֹ֥ר	1	Elihu is using the phrase **crossing over** to mean “dying.” This is a poetic way of referring to death; it suggests the image of crossing a river that is the boundary between one territory and another. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from dying”
33:18	bd6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠שָּֽׁלַח	1	Elihu is using the term **weapon** by association to being killed by a weapon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by being killed by a weapon”
33:19	pgn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הוּכַ֣ח	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God also chastens a person”
33:19	x9jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְר֖וֹב עֲצָמָ֣י⁠ו אֵתָֽן	1	Elihu is speaking as if there were literally **contention** or warfare among the **bones** of this person. He is using an image similar to the one that Job used in [30:17](../30/17.md) when he said, “Night pierces my bones.” Job meant that he got a stabbing sensation of pain in his body when he lay down at night. Here Elihu speaks similarly as if Job’s bones were being wounded in battle and Job was feeling the pain of that. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he feels continual discomfort in his body”
33:20	ubm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ֝⁠נַפְשׁ֗⁠וֹ מַאֲכַ֥ל תַּאֲוָֽה	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and his soul abhors food of desire”
33:20	k022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	חַיָּת֣⁠וֹ & וְ֝⁠נַפְשׁ֗⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is using parts of a person, his **life** and his **soul**, to mean all of him in the act of abhorring food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he … and he abhors”
33:20	k023		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לָ֑חֶם	1	Elihu is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “food”
33:20	x7zp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מַאֲכַ֥ל תַּאֲוָֽה	1	Elihu is using this possessive form to describe **food** that a person would especially **desire**, not food that belongs to desire. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “desirable food” or “delicacies”
33:21	f64y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְשֻׁפּ֥וּ עַ֝צְמוֹתָ֗י⁠ו לֹ֣א רֻאּֽוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and his bones, which people could not see before, become visible”
33:22	gup8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נַפְשׁ֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠חַיָּת֗⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is using parts of a person, his **soul** and his **life**, to mean all of him in the act of approaching death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he … and he draws near”
33:22	ne1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לַֽ⁠מְמִתִֽים	1	Elihu may be referring implicitly to specific angels who were believed to be agents through whom God caused people to die. (There are suggestions of this in [2 Samuel 24:16](../2sa/24/16.md) and [Psalm 78:49](../psa/78/49.md).) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to the angels of death”
33:23	kt34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	אִם	1	Elihu is drawing an implict contrast between the angels of death whom he described in the previous verse and the type of angel he describes in this verse, who helps keep a person from going “down to the pit” (as he says in the next verse). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the contrast explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “But if”
33:23	k024		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מֵלִ֗יץ	1	The word translated **interpreter** is used elsewhere in the Bible to mean someone who translates what someone says in one language into another language, for example, in [Genesis 42:23](../42/23.md). Here, however, it implicitly means someone who speaks on behalf of another person, not necessarily translating what that person says into another language. Alternate translation: “an advocate” or “a spokesman”
33:23	zbw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶחָ֥ד מִנִּי־אָ֑לֶף	1	Elihu does not necessarily mean that exactly **one** out of every **thousand** angels is an interpreter such as he describes. Instead, this expression may mean in a general sense that such angels are rare. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that rare kind of angel”
33:23	k025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠הַגִּ֖יד לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם יָשְׁרֽ⁠וֹ	1	This could mean: (1) that the angel would **declare** to a person how he would need to change his actions so that he would be upright or have a right standing with God (**his** would refer to the person) or so that his actions would conform to God’s **uprightness** (**his** would refer to God). Alternate translation: “to declare to a person how he needs to change his actions in order to become upright” (2) that the angel would **declare** to God on behalf of a person (the word translated **to** would mean “for”) that the person was upright or had the potential to change his actions and become upright and so did not need to die. Alternate translation: “to declare to God on a person’s behalf that he is upright”
33:24	k026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְחֻנֶּ֗⁠נּוּ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God and the pronoun **him** refers to the person whom Elihu has been describing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and God is gracious to that person”
33:24	a1rp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר פְּ֭דָעֵ⁠הוּ מֵ⁠רֶ֥דֶת שָׁ֗חַת מָצָ֥אתִי כֹֽפֶר	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and tells the angels of death to spare him from going down to the pit because he has found a ransom”
33:24	es6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מָצָ֥אתִי כֹֽפֶר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **ransom**, you could express the same idea in another way. See the discussion of this idea in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “I have found a good reason to spare him”
33:24	k027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מָצָ֥אתִי כֹֽפֶר	1	The word **found** does not mean that God did not know where this **ransom** was and had to look for it and finally found it. Rather, it means that when the suffering person repented, this was a consideration that helped provide grounds for sparing him. (See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have recognized a good reason to spare him”
33:25	mu51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּשָׂר֣⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is using one part of this person’s body, his **flesh**, to mean his whole body in the act of being rejuvenated. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his body”
33:25	k7le		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יָ֝שׁ֗וּב לִ⁠ימֵ֥י עֲלוּמָֽי⁠ו	1	Elihu is speaking of this person’s **flesh** as if it were a living thing that could go back in time to his **youth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it becomes as it was in the days of his youth”
33:25	n9hs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠ימֵ֥י עֲלוּמָֽי⁠ו	1	Elihu is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the time of his youth”
33:26	k028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 וַ⁠יִּרְצֵ֗⁠הוּ וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא פָּ֭נָי⁠ו בִּ⁠תְרוּעָ֑ה	1	The pronoun **he** means God in the first instance and, in the second instance, **he** means the person whom Elihu has been describing. The pronoun **him** refers to this person, and the pronoun **his** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and God will accept this person, and the person will see God’s face with joy”
33:26	yt2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא פָּ֭נָי⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Based on what Elihu says in the next two verses, this probably means that he will come into God’s presence in a temple. Alternate translation: “and he will come into God’s presence in a temple”
33:26	d3zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֥שֶׁב לֶ֝⁠אֱנ֗וֹשׁ צִדְקָתֽ⁠וֹ	1	This could mean: Alternate translation: (1) “for God will restore the man to a right standing with him” or (2) “and God will restore his reputation as a righteous person” or (3) “and God will set things right for the man again”
33:27	k029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָשֹׁ֤ר ׀ עַל־אֲנָשִׁ֗ים	1	Elihu assumes that Job will understand that by **sing**, he means that the person will go to a temple and publicly sing a song of thanksgiving to celebrate how God has delivered him, as was the custom in this culture. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “He will sing a song of thanksgiving in a temple”
33:27	t53p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר חָ֭טָאתִי וְ⁠יָשָׁ֥ר הֶעֱוֵ֗יתִי וְ⁠לֹא־שָׁ֥וָה לִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and say that he sinned and turned aside uprightness but that God did not requite to him”
33:27	k030		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠יָשָׁ֥ר הֶעֱוֵ֗יתִי	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **uprightness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I turned aside what was right”
33:27	k031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠יָשָׁ֥ר הֶעֱוֵ֗יתִי	1	Elihu is speaking of **uprightness** as if it were a living thing that had been walking down the right path and he **turned** it **aside** so that it began going down the wrong path. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I did what was not right”
33:28	u2a3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	פָּדָ֣ה נַ֭פְשׁוֹ & מֵ⁠עֲבֹ֣ר בַּ⁠שָּׁ֑חַת וְ֝חַיָּתוֹ & בָּ⁠א֥וֹר תִּרְאֶֽה	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation in such a way that there would not be a quotation within a quotation, you can continue doing that here. Alternate translation: “He will say that God has redeemed his soul from going over into the pit and that his life life will see light”
33:28	wt12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נַ֭פְשׁוֹ & וְ֝חַיָּתוֹ	1	Elihu is using parts of this person, his **soul** and his **life**, to mean all of him in the act of being redeemed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “me … and I”
33:28	f6ps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝חַיָּתוֹ & בָּ⁠א֥וֹר תִּרְאֶֽה	1	This person is using the term **light** by association to mean life on earth. As in many other places in the book, here the realm of the living is described as a place of light, by contrast with the realm of the dead, which is a place of darkness. (For example, in [18:18](../18/18.md), “They will drive him from light into darkness, and they will chase him from the world.”) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will continue to live on earth”
33:29	w47t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	פַּעֲמַ֖יִם שָׁל֣וֹשׁ	1	As he did in verse 14, here Elihu is naming a number that should be sufficient to illustrate his point and then increasing that number by one for emphasis. This was a common device in Hebrew poetry. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “again and again”
33:30	m27i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נַ֭פְשׁ⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is using one part of this person, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “him”
33:30	myd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לֵ֝⁠א֗וֹר בְּ⁠א֣וֹר הַֽ⁠חַיִּים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “so that he can enlighten him with the light of the living”
33:30	k032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לֵ֝⁠א֗וֹר בְּ⁠א֣וֹר הַֽ⁠חַיִּים	1	Elihu is using the plural adjective **living** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “so that he can enlighten him with the light of living people”
33:30	k033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	לֵ֝⁠א֗וֹר בְּ⁠א֣וֹר הַֽ⁠חַיִּים	1	Elihu is using the possessive form, **the light of the living**, to describe the light that living people have and by which they see, not light that living people give off. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “so that he can enlighten him with the light that living people have”
33:30	k034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֵ֝⁠א֗וֹר בְּ⁠א֣וֹר הַֽ⁠חַיִּים	1	As in verse 38, the term **light** refers by association to life on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that he can restore him to life among the other people who live on earth”
33:31	z1l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֥י אֲדַבֵּֽר	1	For emphasis, Elihu is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **speak**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and let me be the one who speaks”
33:32	k035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	אִם	1	Since Elihu told Job in the previous verse to **listen** and be **silent**, when he tells him in this verse to **speak** and **answer**, he implicitly means that Job should do this only after listening to him. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Then if”
33:32	k036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יֵשׁ־מִלִּ֥ין	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what Job would say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you have something to say”
33:32	g3l6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חָפַ֥צְתִּי צַדְּקֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	Elihu seems to mean that he desires to show that Job has been right in saying that God is not punishing him for committing sin. Elihu has been suggesting that Job’s sufferings are instead a warning from God not to take a sinful course of action. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I am trying to show that you have been right in saying that God is not punishing you for committing sin”
33:33	k037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	אִם	1	Elihu is implicitly drawing a contrast, suggesting that, on the other hand, Job may not have anything to say once he has listened to him further. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the contrast explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “But if”
33:33	k038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַתָּ֥ה שְֽׁמַֽע־לִ֑⁠י	1	For emphasis, Elihu is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **listen**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “you be the one who listens while I speak”
33:33	k039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	חָכְמָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what is wise”
34:intro	b9ku				0	# Job 34 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu speaks first to Job’s friends and others who may be listening, then from verse 16 onward he addresses Job directly, and then he speaks again to the others about Job starting in verse 34.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Elihu speaking harshly about Job\n\nIt may be puzzling to your readers that while Elihu promises Job in 33:7 that he will be gentle with him, in this chapter, in verses 7–8 and 35, Elihu speaks very harshly about Job. However, this is really a matter of interpretation rather than translation, so it is not necessary to offer an explanation within the text of your translation.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Elihu quoting Job and his friends\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Elihu directly quotes Job or his friends. He does this to affirm what the friends said and to challenge what Job said. To help your readers appreciate that Elihu is doing this, you may wish to translate his expressions the same way you translated them when Job or his friends used them.\nIn 34:3, Elihu quotes what Job said in 12:11.\nIn 34:5, Elihu quotes what Job said in 27:2.\nIn 34:6, Elihu quotes what Job said in 6:4, 16:13, and 27:4.\nIn 34:7, Elihu quotes what Eliphaz said in 15:16.\nIn 34:12, Elihu quotes what Bildad said in 8:3.\n\n### “man” and “men” with generic meaning\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Elihu uses the words “man” and “men” in a generic sense that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Notes suggest ways in which you might do this. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations.)\n\n### “For” at the start of a verse introducing a reason\n\nSeveral times in this chapter, Elihu says “For” at the beginning of a verse to introduce the reason for something he said in the previous verse. Elihu does this in verses 3, 5, 9, 11, 21, and 37. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could refer back more explicitly to the previous verse in order to show what Elihu is doing. The UST models ways to do this in each case. (“For” at the beginning of verse 23 introduces a new consideration, as the UST also illustrates.) (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases.)
34:1	h9vc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַן אֱלִיה֗וּא וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. In this case, Elihu said more things in light of what he had already said and thus, in a sense, in answer to them. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And Elihu said further, in light of what he had already said”
34:2	k8a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלָּ֑⁠י	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I have to say”
34:2	zux7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חֲכָמִ֣ים	1	Elihu is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. (The ULT adds the word **ones** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “you who are wise”
34:3	ln8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ יִטְעַ֥ם לֶ⁠אֱכֹֽל	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Elihu is using the same phrase that Job used to tell his friends in [12:11](../12/11.md) that he had considered and rejected their perspective. Elihu is quoting Job in order to tell him that, for his part, he has considered Job’s perspective and rejected it. To help your readers recognize this, you may wish to use the same language in your translation here as you did in [12:11](../12/11.md).
34:3	k040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ יִטְעַ֥ם לֶ⁠אֱכֹֽל	1	Elihu is using the word **and** to indicate that the phrase it introduces is just as true as the previous phrase. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “the ear tests words, just as the palate tastes food”
34:3	k041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ יִטְעַ֥ם לֶ⁠אֱכֹֽל	1	Elihu is speaking of the **ear** as if it could **test words** by itself. He is using the ear to represent hearing, and he means that people themselves test or consider the words of others when they hear them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “people consider others’ words when they hear them, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”
34:3	k043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ יִטְעַ֥ם לֶ⁠אֱכֹֽל	1	Though Elihu is making a general statement, he is referring implicitly to what Job has said and what he has decided about it. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have heard what Job has said and I have considered it and decided that it is not true, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”
34:3	k042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלִּ֣ין	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what people say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what people say”
34:3	k044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ יִטְעַ֥ם לֶ⁠אֱכֹֽל	1	Elihu is speaking of the **palate** or mouth as if it could **taste** by itself. He means that with their mouths, people discern the taste of the food that they eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”
34:4	v6hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	מִשְׁפָּ֥ט נִבְחֲרָה־לָּ֑⁠נוּ נֵדְעָ֖ה בֵינֵ֣י⁠נוּ מַה־טּֽוֹב	1	Elihu is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and to the “wise ones” whom he is addressing, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (Even though Job is present and listening, Elihu is not addressing him, so Elihu is still saying **us** to include everyone whom he actually is addressing.)
34:4	k045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מִשְׁפָּ֥ט	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what is just”
34:5	k046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כִּֽי־אָ֭מַר אִיּ֣וֹב צָדַ֑קְתִּי וְ֝⁠אֵ֗ל הֵסִ֥יר מִשְׁפָּטִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “For Job has said that he is righteous but that God has taken away his justice”
34:5	k2e1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗ל הֵסִ֥יר מִשְׁפָּטִֽ⁠י	1	Elihu is saying that Job has spoken of **justice** as if it were an object that God had **taken away** from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but God has not been just in the way that he has treated me”
34:6	k047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	עַל־מִשְׁפָּטִ֥⁠י אֲכַזֵּ֑ב אָנ֖וּשׁ חִצִּ֣⁠י בְלִי־פָֽשַׁע	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation in such a way that there would not be a quotation within a quotation, you can continue doing that here. Alternate translation: “Job has said that he would not lie about his justice and that his arrow is incurable, without transgression”
34:6	k523		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַל־מִשְׁפָּטִ֥⁠י אֲכַזֵּ֑ב	1	In this quotation by Elihu, Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I would not lie about my justice!”
34:6	k048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עַל־מִשְׁפָּטִ֥⁠י אֲכַזֵּ֑ב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I would not lie about whether I had done the right thing!”
34:6	i95p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חִצִּ֣⁠י	1	In this quotation by Elihu, Job is using the term **arrow** by association to mean a wound from an arrow. (Elihu is referring back to what Job said in [16:13](../0161/13.md) about God’s archers fatally wounding him with arrows.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My wound”
34:6	k049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	בְלִי־פָֽשַׁע	1	In this quotation by Elihu, Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “even though I am without transgression”
34:7	nd2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִי־גֶ֥בֶר כְּ⁠אִיּ֑וֹב	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “There is no other person like Job!”
34:7	glm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִֽשְׁתֶּה־לַּ֥עַג כַּ⁠מָּֽיִם	1	Elihu is speaking as if Job literally drank **scorn** the way he would drink **water**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He indulges freely in making scornful statements”
34:8	j3zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	פֹּ֣עֲלֵי אָ֑וֶן & אַנְשֵׁי־רֶֽשַׁע	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **iniquity** and **wickedness**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “people who do what is iniquitous … people who are wicked”
34:9	k050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כִּֽי־אָ֭מַר לֹ֣א יִסְכָּן־גָּ֑בֶר בִּ֝⁠רְצֹת֗⁠וֹ עִם־אֱלֹהִֽים	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “For he has said that it does not benefit a person when he delights himself with God”
34:10	n22e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַ֥נֲשֵׁ֥י לֵבָ֗ב	1	Here the **heart** represents understanding. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “men of understanding” or “you wise men”
34:10	meh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	חָלִ֖לָ⁠ה לָ⁠אֵ֥ל מֵ⁠רֶ֗שַׁע וְ⁠שַׁדַּ֥י מֵ⁠עָֽוֶל	1	See how you translated the expression ”Sacrilege to“ in [27:5](../27/05.md). Alternate translation: “Far be it from God to do wickedness, and from the Almighty to do iniquity”
34:10	k051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	חָלִ֖לָ⁠ה לָ⁠אֵ֥ל מֵ⁠רֶ֗שַׁע וְ⁠שַׁדַּ֥י מֵ⁠עָֽוֶל	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Far be it from God to do wickedness, and far be it from the Almighty to do iniquity”
34:11	ia8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְשַׁלֶּם & יַמְצִאֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God in both instances. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God repays … God causes it to find him”
34:11	y31y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פֹ֣עַל אָ֭דָם יְשַׁלֶּם־ל֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the word “repay” in [21:19](../21/19.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God punishes a person for what he does”
34:11	k052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠כְ⁠אֹ֥רַח אִ֝֗ישׁ	1	Elihu is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **path** that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and based on how a person lives”
34:11	k053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַמְצִאֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	Here, **it** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “God causes things to happen to him”
34:13	n1w5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־פָקַ֣ד עָלָ֣י⁠ו אָ֑רְצָ⁠ה וּ⁠מִ֥י שָׂ֝֗ם תֵּבֵ֥ל כֻּלָּֽ⁠הּ	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “God did not need anyone to appoint him over the earth or to set all of the world under his dominion!”
34:13	k054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	 וּ⁠מִ֥י שָׂ֝֗ם תֵּבֵ֥ל כֻּלָּֽ⁠הּ	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And who set the world, all of it, under his dominion”
34:14	d4kx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־יָשִׂ֣ים אֵלָ֣י⁠ו לִבּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Here the **heart** represents the thoughts and perceptions. Alternate translation: “If he considered only himself” or “If he thought only about himself”
34:14	t8rt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רוּח֥⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠נִשְׁמָת֗⁠וֹ אֵלָ֥י⁠ו יֶאֱסֹֽף	1	As he did in [32:](../32/08.md), here Elihu is alluding to the way that God originally breathed the breath of life into humans. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “if he withdrew his Spirit and the breath of life from humans”
34:15	lah1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כָּל־בָּשָׂ֣ר	1	Elihu is using the term **flesh** by association to mean the creatures that God made, which generally have flesh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “all creatures”
34:15	k055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יִגְוַ֣ע & יָ֑חַד	1	Elihu is using the word **expire** to mean “die.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “would pass away together” or “would die at the same time”
34:15	tmc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠אָדָ֗ם עַל־עָפָ֥ר יָשֽׁוּב	1	Elihu does not mean that people would actively **return** to the **dust** on their own. Rather, as in [33:6](../33/06.md), he is referring to the way that God originally formed people from the dust of the earth, and he means that humans would die and their bodies would become dust again. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and people would die be buried and their bodies would decompose and become part of the dirt again”
34:16	h7bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אִם־בִּ֥ינָה	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “But if understanding is to you” or “But if you have understanding”
34:16	lpb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שִׁמְעָ⁠ה & הַ֝אֲזִ֗ינָ⁠ה	1	The imperatives **hear** and **listen** are singular because Elihu is now addressing Job directly. (He is marking a transition from addressing the other “wise ones” who are present by repeating those two terms, which he also used in verse 2.) So use singular imperative forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
34:16	giw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ֝אֲזִ֗ינָ⁠ה לְ⁠ק֣וֹל מִלָּֽ⁠י	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words. As in [33:8](../33/08.md), he may be referring to the **sound** of the words to mean the exact words, that is, exactly what he is going to say. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “listen to exactly what I am going to say”
34:17	rc4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠אַ֬ף שׂוֹנֵ֣א מִשְׁפָּ֣ט יַחֲב֑וֹשׁ וְ⁠אִם־צַדִּ֖יק כַּבִּ֣יר תַּרְשִֽׁיעַ	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. (The second question continues into the next two verses, but in many languages it will not be necessary to translate those verses differently except for the punctuation at the end of verse 19.) Alternate translation: “One hating justice will certainly not govern! No, you should not condemn the Righteous One, the Mighty One”
34:17	s1zl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־צַדִּ֖יק כַּבִּ֣יר תַּרְשִֽׁיעַ	1	Elihu is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer.

34:17	l8xs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	צַדִּ֖יק כַּבִּ֣יר	1	Elihu is using the adjectives **Righteous** and **Mighty** as nouns to mean a certain person, God, who possesses these qualities supremely. The ULT adds the word **One** in each case to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “God, who is supremely righteous and mighty”

Alternate translation: “the one telling a king that he is worthless and telling nobles that they are wicked”
34:18	pa2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לְ⁠מֶ֣לֶךְ	1	Elihu is not referring to a specific **king**. He means kings in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “to kings”

34:19	k057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵי־דָ֑ל	1	In this context, the phrase **to the face of** means “in front of” or “ahead of.” Alternate translation: “ahead of the poor” or “more than the poor”
34:19	k058		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	שׁ֭וֹעַ & דָ֑ל	1	Elihu is using the adjectives **rich** and **poor** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people.

34:19	k059		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	יָדָ֣י⁠ו	1	If you decided in verse 17 to use a statement or exclamation to translate the question that begins in the middle of that verse and continues to the end of this verse, remember to use the punctuation here that your language uses to mark the end of a statement or exclamation.
34:20	xkd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠חֲצ֪וֹת לָ֥יְלָה	1	Elihu is speaking as if what he is describing generally happens to people literally **in the middle of the night**. He means that it happens suddenly and unexpectedly, as if it happened at the time when people are usually asleep. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and suddenly and unexpectedly”
34:20	yx7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יְגֹעֲשׁ֣וּ עָ֣ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God shakes people”
34:20	nq3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠יַעֲבֹ֑רוּ	1	Elihu is using the word **pass** to mean “die.” This is a mild or poetic way of referring to death.

34:20	k060		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠יָסִ֥ירוּ אַ֝בִּ֗יר	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “and the mighty are taken away”
34:20	k061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אַ֝בִּ֗יר	1	Elihu is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

34:20	dsu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹ֣א בְ⁠יָֽד	1	Elihu is using one part of a human being, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of potentially taking away a mighty person (although Elihu says that no person actually does this). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “not by a human being”
34:21	k062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עֵ֭ינָי⁠ו & יִרְאֶֽה	1	The first instance of the pronoun **his** and the pronoun **he** refer to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God’s eyes … God sees”
34:21	syl2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֵ֭ינָי⁠ו עַל	1	Elihu is using one part of God, his **eyes**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he looks upon”

34:22	em2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	אֵֽין־חֹ֭שֶׁךְ וְ⁠אֵ֣ין צַלְמָ֑וֶת	1	The terms **darkness** and **deep darkness** mean similar things. Elihu is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “There is no darkness at all”

See how you translated the expression “set upon” in [23:6](../23/06.md). Alternate translation: “God does not set his heart upon a person” or “God does not consider a person”
34:23	dy7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לַ⁠הֲלֹ֥ךְ אֶל־אֵ֝֗ל בַּ⁠מִּשְׁפָּֽט	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

35:intro	mfr6				0	# Job 35 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu speaks primarily to Job, although in the last verse he speaks about Job to the others who are present.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Does God not benefit when humans do what is right?\n\nIn verses 6–8, Elihu tells Job that whether he is good or bad has no effect on God; that only affects other people. Elihu probably means that God does not owe Job anything for being good and that God does not have to defend himself against Job being bad. But if what Elihu says is taken in a general sense, then it does not express the full teaching of the Bible. Elsewhere the Bible says that God is delighted when people obey him and that God grieves when people sin, knowing the destructive effects that this will have. God is glorified when people acknowledge that humans flourish when they obey his commandments. Elihu, like Job’s friends, says things that are true to a certain extent but that do not fully express the counsel of God as found in the Bible as a whole.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### reference of “you” and “your”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Elihu uses the pronouns “you” and “your” to address Job individually, so use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In verse 3, in the quotation by Elihu, the pronoun “you” is also singular because Job is using it to address God.
35:1	k080		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַן אֱלִיה֗וּ וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	See how you translated the same expression in [34:1](../34/01.md). Alternate translation: “And Elihu said further, in light of what he had already said”
35:2	s9jw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ֭⁠זֹאת חָשַׁ֣בְתָּ לְ⁠מִשְׁפָּ֑ט	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not consider this to be justice!”
35:2	g7jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	הֲ֭⁠זֹאת חָשַׁ֣בְתָּ לְ⁠מִשְׁפָּ֑ט	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is singular here and throughout the chapter because Elihu is addressing Job directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
35:2	yh9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הֲ֭⁠זֹאת חָשַׁ֣בְתָּ לְ⁠מִשְׁפָּ֑ט	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not consider this a just thing to say!”
35:2	l3t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אָ֝מַ֗רְתָּ צִדְקִ֥⁠י מֵ⁠אֵֽל	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You say that you are more righteous than God” or, since this is not a direct quote from Job, “You speak as if you are more righteous than God”
35:3	k081		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Elihu is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he said in the previous verse that Job claimed to be more righteous than God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “I say that because”
35:3	k082		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	תֹ֭אמַר מַה־יִּסְכָּן־לָ֑⁠ךְ מָֽה־אֹ֝עִ֗יל מֵֽ⁠חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “you have said to God, ‘What does it benefit you if I am righteous? What more do I gain by not sinning than if I do sin?’”
35:3	k083		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	תֹ֭אמַר מַה־יִּסְכָּן־לָ֑⁠ךְ מָֽה־אֹ֝עִ֗יל מֵֽ⁠חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “you have asked God what it benefits him if you do not sin and what more you gain by not sinning than if you do sin”
35:3	w8qv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־יִּסְכָּן־לָ֑⁠ךְ מָֽה־אֹ֝עִ֗יל מֵֽ⁠חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	In this quotation by Elihu, Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “It does not benefit you if I do not sin! I do not gain more by not sinning than if I do sin!”
35:3	k084		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מַה־יִּסְכָּן־לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	The word **you** is singular here because in this quotation by Elihu, Job is addressing God directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
35:3	k085		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵֽ⁠חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	In this quotation by Elihu, Job is using the term **sin** by association to mean the act of sinning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “more than if I had sinned”
35:4	k086		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲ֭נִי אֲשִֽׁיבְ⁠ךָ֣ מִלִּ֑ין	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he is going to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will speak in reply to you”
35:4	tp7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲ֭נִי	1	For emphasis, Elihu is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of showing this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I myself”
35:4	k087		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	 וְֽ⁠אֶת־רֵעֶ֥י⁠ךָ עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and I will answer your friends with you”
35:5	k088		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	הַבֵּ֣ט שָׁמַ֣יִם וּ⁠רְאֵ֑ה	1	The terms **Observe** and **see** mean similar things. Elihu is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Carefully observe the heavens”
35:5	k089		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁ֝חָקִ֗ים גָּבְה֥וּ מִמֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	Elihu is saying implicitly that God is even higher above Job than the **heavens** and the **clouds**. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the clouds soar above you; God is even greater than that!”
35:6	t1v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־חָ֭טָאתָ מַה־תִּפְעָל־בּ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠רַבּ֥וּ פְ֝שָׁעֶ֗י⁠ךָ מַה־תַּעֲשֶׂה־לּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “If you sin, you do not accomplish anything against God. If your transgressions multiply, you do not do anything to him.”
35:6	s7x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠רַבּ֥וּ  פְ֝שָׁעֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Elihu is speaking of Job’s supposed **transgressions** as if they were living things that could **multiply** on their own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or if you commit many transgressions”
35:7	m97k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־צָ֭דַקְתָּ מַה־תִּתֶּן־ל֑⁠וֹ א֥וֹ מַה־מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֥ יִקָּֽח	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “If you are righteous, you do not give anything to God; he does not receive anything from your hand!”
35:7	i418		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֥	1	Elihu is using one part of Job, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of potentially giving something to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from you”
35:8	fa27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וּ⁠לְ⁠בֶן־אָ֝דָ֗ם	1	See how you translated the expression “son of man” in [16:21](../16/21.md). Alternate translation: “and … is to a human being”
35:9	p9sw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	מֵ֭⁠רֹב עֲשׁוּקִ֣ים	1	Elihu is using the plural form **oppressions** in a context where the singular term “oppression” would suffice. This suggests that he is using the plural form for emphasis. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Because of great oppression”
35:9	k090		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַזְעִ֑יקוּ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to people generally. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “people cry out for justice”
35:9	zb6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠זְּר֣וֹעַ	1	Here, **arm** represents power, and in this context, the term indicates that **mighty** people are using their power to hurt others. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because of the violence of”
35:9	k091		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רַבִּֽים	1	Elihu is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “mighty people”
35:10	k092		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְֽ⁠לֹא־אָמַ֗ר אַ֭יֵּה אֱל֣וֹהַּ עֹשָׂ֑⁠י נֹתֵ֖ן זְמִר֣וֹת בַּ⁠לָּֽיְלָה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But one does not ask where God his Maker is, the one giving songs in the night”
35:10	k093		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַ֭יֵּה אֱל֣וֹהַּ עֹשָׂ֑⁠י	1	The expression **Where is** indicates a desire to know whether God will act. For example, in [2 Kings 2:14](../2ki/02/14.md), Elisha asks, “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?” as he strikes the Jordan River with Elijah’s coat in order to part its waters so that he can walk across the riverbed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate the question as the expression of a wish. Alternate translation: “I wish that God my Maker would act on my behalf”
35:10	f89r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נֹתֵ֖ן זְמִר֣וֹת בַּ⁠לָּֽיְלָה	1	Here, **night** represents difficult circumstances, and **songs** represent the rejoicing of a person whom God has delivered. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one delivering people from difficult circumstances”
35:11	k094		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מַ֭לְּפֵ⁠נוּ מִ⁠בַּהֲמ֣וֹת אָ֑רֶץ וּ⁠מֵ⁠ע֖וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֣יִם יְחַכְּמֵֽ⁠נוּ	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation in such a way that there would not be a quotation within a quotation, you can continue doing that here. Alternate translation: “the one teaching people more than the beasts of the earth, making them wiser than the birds of the heavens.”
35:11	k095		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מַ֭לְּפֵ⁠נוּ מִ⁠בַּהֲמ֣וֹת אָ֑רֶץ וּ⁠מֵ⁠ע֖וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֣יִם יְחַכְּמֵֽ⁠נוּ	1	In this quotation, the speaker describes **beasts** and **birds** as if they were living things that God could teach and make wise. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who gave us more understanding than the beasts of the earth and the birds of the heavens”
35:11	k096		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	מַ֭לְּפֵ⁠נוּ & יְחַכְּמֵֽ⁠נוּ	1	The speaker is using the pronoun **us** to mean people and thus to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.
35:12	xj4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שָׁ֣ם	1	Elihu is speaking as if the troubles that people experience were a place that they were in. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “In their troubles,”
35:12	k097		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲנֶ֑ה מִ֝⁠פְּנֵ֗י גְּא֣וֹן רָעִֽים	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of something by association with the way that people can see the face of someone who is present.If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he does not answer, since pride is present in those evil ones” or “but he does not answer, since those evil ones are so proud”
35:12	k098		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רָעִֽים	1	Elihu is using the adjective **evil** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The ULT adds the word **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “evil people”
35:13	k099		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שָׁ֭וְא לֹא־יִשְׁמַ֥ע ׀ אֵ֑ל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **vanity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Here the word **vanity** describes a cry to God for help that is insincere. The person asking for God’s help has not repented of the sins that have gotten him into trouble; he is still doing “evil,” as verse 12 indicates. Alternate translation: “God does not hear an insincere prayer for help”
35:13	k100		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שָׁ֭וְא לֹא־יִשְׁמַ֥ע ׀ אֵ֑ל	1	Elihu is using the term **hear** in a specific sense to mean “answer.” Alternate translation: “God will not answer an insincere prayer for help”
35:13	k101		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ֝⁠שַׁדַּ֗י לֹ֣א יְשׁוּרֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	In this context, the word **regard** also means “answer.” Elihu is using both hearing and seeing in parallel statements to emphasize his point. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (You could also combine both parts of this verse into a single statement, as the UST does.) Alternate translation: “no, the Almighty will not answer such a prayer”
35:14	di2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אַ֣ף כִּֽי	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “How much less will God answer your prayers, given that”
35:14	c513		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	תֹ֭אמַר לֹ֣א תְשׁוּרֶ֑⁠נּוּ דִּ֥ין לְ֝⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו וּ⁠תְח֥וֹלֵֽל לֽ⁠וֹ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “you say, ‘I do not see him; the case is to his face, and I am waiting for him,’”
35:14	njy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דִּ֥ין לְ֝⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	In this context, the phrase **to his face** means “in front of him.” This is likely a reference to the written documents that people in this culture prepared for legal proceedings, as a note to [31:35](../31/35.md) discusses. Job would be saying that his testimony was “in front of” God, that is, he had submitted it for God to read. Alternate translation: “you have submitted your case to him”
35:15	ub2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	 וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה כִּי־אַ֭יִן פָּקַ֣ד אַפּ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יָדַ֖ע בַּ⁠פַּ֣שׁ מְאֹֽד	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate the beginning of this indirect quotation as a direct quotation, you can also translate the continuation of the indirect quotation here as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “and also, ‘In his anger, he does not visit, and he does not take much notice of transgression’!”
35:15	kpu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַ֭יִן פָּקַ֣ד	1	As Job did in [31:14](../31/14.md), here Elihu is using the term **visit** in a particular sense. When applied to God, the term often indicates that God takes action in the life of a person or group, whether to help needy people or to punish guilty people. Here it has the latter sense. Alternate translation: “God does not punish people who are guilty of committing sin”
35:16	k102		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ֭⁠אִיּוֹב & יִפְצֶה־פִּ֑י⁠הוּ	1	Elihu is using the first part of the speaking process, opening one’s **mouth**, to mean the entire process of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “So Job speaks”
35:16	k103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בִּ⁠בְלִי־דַ֝֗עַת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation, as in the UST: “without knowing what he is talking about”
35:16	ben3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	 מִלִּ֥ין יַכְבִּֽר	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he says many things”
36:intro	pp2j				0	# Job 36 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Elihu’s speech. In this chapter, Elihu speaks primarily to Job, although others are present and listening.\n\n- Verses 1–21: Elihu says that God uses suffering to warn and correct people.\n- Verses 22–23: Elihu describes how great God is, using a storm that is gathering and approaching to describe God’s great power.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The difficulty of understanding verses 17–21\n\nVerses 17–21 are very difficult to understand. Biblical scholars have offered a variety of explanations of what Elihu says in each verse. Published versions of the Bible differ significantly from one another in their renderings of this material. The ULT seeks to offer a consistent and reasonable translation of these verses. But if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may find that it differs from the ULT in several places in the way that it translates these verses. If there is a Bible translation in your region, you may wish to use the readings that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the readings of ULT.\n\n### singular “you” and “your”\n\nThe pronouns “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Elihu is addressing Job. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use singular forms in your translation.\n\n### “hear” meaning “obey”\n\nIn verses 10, 11, and 12, Elihu uses the term “hear” in a specific sense to mean “obey.” You may wish to use the term “obey” in each instance in your translation.
36:1	k104		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יֹּ֥סֶף אֱלִיה֗וּא וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **continued** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, the person said it to add more to what he had already said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And Elihu said further”
36:2	k105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	כַּתַּר & וַ⁠אֲחַוֶּ֑⁠ךָּ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative **Be patient** are singular here because in this chapter, Elihu is addressing Job directly. So if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the singular form in your translation here and throughout the chapter.
36:2	h1hx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠אֲחַוֶּ֑⁠ךָּ	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and I will show you that God has not been punishing you unfairly”
36:2	k106		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ע֖וֹד לֶ⁠אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִלִּֽים	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he wants to say further by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “there are more things to say on behalf of God”
36:3	k107		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶשָּׂ֣א דֵ֭עִ⁠י לְ⁠מֵ⁠רָח֑וֹק	1	Elihu is describing places that are **afar** off from the perspective of how far a person would have to travel to come from those places. That is why he speaks of the places as being **from afar** and why he speaks of going to those places as going **to from afar**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will carry my knowledge to distant places”
36:3	c3pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶשָּׂ֣א דֵ֭עִ⁠י לְ⁠מֵ⁠רָח֑וֹק	1	Elihu is speaking as if his **knowledge** were an object that he could literally **carry** to distant places. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “I will show a wide knowledge of my subject” or “I will speak with comprehensive knowledge”
36:3	k1008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֶשָּׂ֣א דֵ֭עִ⁠י לְ⁠מֵ⁠רָח֑וֹק	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I will show that I know a wide range of things”
36:3	u4g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠לְ⁠פֹעֲלִ֗⁠י אֶֽתֵּֽן־צֶֽדֶק	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I will show that my Maker is righteous”
36:3	k109		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠לְ⁠פֹעֲלִ֗⁠י	1	By **my Maker**, Elihu implicitly means God, who made him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and … to God, who made me”
36:4	sqx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלָּ֑⁠י	1	Elihu is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I say”
36:4	k111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תְּמִ֖ים דֵּע֣וֹת עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Elihu is using the adjective phrase **complete in knowledge** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjective phrases in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “someone who has complete knowledge is with you”
36:4	k112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	תְּמִ֖ים דֵּע֣וֹת עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Elihu says **complete** here as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: ““someone who has very comprehensive knowledge is with you”
36:4	br1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	תְּמִ֖ים דֵּע֣וֹת עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Elihu is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I who have very comprehensive knowledge am with you”
36:5	z14c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִמְאָ֑ס	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. He is probably responding to what Job said to God in [10:3](../10/03.md), “you … despise the work of your hands.” If that would be clearer in your language, you can supply these words from the context, specifically from verse 2, where Elihu speaks of God as his “Maker.” Alternate translation: “and he does not despise any of the people whom he has made”
36:5	j9ct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כַּ֝בִּ֗יר כֹּ֣חַֽ לֵֽב	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “he is also mighty in that he is strong in heart”
36:5	k113		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּ֝בִּ֗יר כֹּ֣חַֽ לֵֽב	1	Here the **heart** represents the mind or understanding. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he is also mighty in that he has great understanding”
36:6	k114		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	לֹא־יְחַיֶּ֥ה רָשָׁ֑ע	1	Elihu is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of his intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He punishes the wicked by killing them”
36:6	k115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רָשָׁ֑ע & עֲנִיִּ֣ים	1	Elihu is using the adjectives **wicked** and **lowly** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “wicked people … lowly people”
36:6	k117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠מִשְׁפַּ֖ט עֲנִיִּ֣ים יִתֵּֽן	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “but he makes sure that others treat lowly people fairly”
36:6	k116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עֲנִיִּ֣ים	1	See how you translated the term **lowly** in [29:12](../29/12.md).
36:7	k118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	לֹֽא־יִגְרַ֥ע מִ⁠צַּדִּ֗יק עֵ֫ינָ֥י⁠ו	1	Elihu is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of his intended meaning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He keeps his eyes on the righteous”
36:7	q9mj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹֽא־יִגְרַ֥ע מִ⁠צַּדִּ֗יק עֵ֫ינָ֥י⁠ו	1	Elihu is using one part of God, his **eyes**, to mean all of him in the act of watching over the righteous. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He continually watches over the righteous”
36:7	k119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	מִ⁠צַּדִּ֗יק	1	Elihu is using the adjective **righteous** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from the person who is righteous”
36:7	k120		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מִ⁠צַּדִּ֗יק	1	Elihu is not referring to a specific **righteous** person. He means righteous people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form, particularly since Elihu uses plural forms in the rest of this verse.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he gives them positions of power and influence”
36:7	x6yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּגְבָּֽהוּ	1	Elihu is speaking as if righteous people literally **rise high** when God helps them.

Elihu may be using repetition to emphasize the idea that these phrases express. In that case, he would be speaking in both phrases as if righteous people were literally **bound** or **caught** by affliction in order to say that they were suffering from affliction. Alternate translation: “If they are bound in chains of affliction; yes, if they are caught in cords of affliction” (2) being bound in actual **chains**. This would mean that people who had previously been righteous had unfortunately committed some crime and had been punished with imprisonment. In that case Elihu would be using **chains** in the first part of the verse to mean actual physical restraint and **cords** in the second part of the verse to represent sufferings. Alternate translation: “But if they are put in prison for some crime or if they are suffering from affliction”

36:9	qj2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	פָּעֳלָ֑⁠ם וּ֝⁠פִשְׁעֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **transgressions** tells what kind of **deeds** these people did. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “their evil deeds”
36:9	k121		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֣י יִתְגַּבָּֽרוּ	1	Elihu is using the word **for** to introduce the reason why these people committed **deeds** that were **transgressions**.

Alternate translation: “their ears”

36:11	k127		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִשְׁמְע֗וּ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Elihu is using the term **hear** in a specific sense to mean “obey.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, here and in the next two verses.

36:12	k129		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠יִגְוְע֗וּ	1	Elihu is using the word **expire** to mean “die.” This is a mild way of referring to death.

36:12	k130		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כִּ⁠בְלִי־דָֽעַת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “because they acted as if they did not know how God wanted them to live”
36:13	k131		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְֽ⁠חַנְפֵי־לֵ֭ב	1	Elihu is using the adjective phrase **godless of heart** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person.

36:13	a4sw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲסָרָֽ⁠ם	1	Elihu is speaking as if God literally **binds** disobedient people.

36:14	k135		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בַּ⁠נֹּ֣עַר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **youth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “while they are still young”

36:16	k143		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	רַ֭חַב לֹא־מוּצָ֣ק תַּחְתֶּ֑י⁠הָ	1	These two expressions mean the same thing. Elihu is using them together for emphasis.

36:16	h4g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רַ֭חַב לֹא־מוּצָ֣ק תַּחְתֶּ֑י⁠הָ	1	Elihu is speaking as if God literally would have brought Job to a **broad place**, that is, to an open square such as Job mentioned in [29:7](../29/07.md). Elihu means that God would have brought Job into a situation in life where he had many opportunities and the means to pursue them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “into a situation where you had many opportunities and the means to pursue them”
36:16	k144		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־מוּצָ֣ק תַּחְתֶּ֑י⁠הָ	1	Elihu is using the expression **under it** to describe what this place is like.

36:17	ybk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠דִין־רָשָׁ֥ע מָלֵ֑אתָ	1	For emphasis, Elihu is speaking as if Job were a container that was **full** of **judgment**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in another way. Elihu could mean: (1) that Job is like the godless people he described in verse 13, who remain angry with God because they judge that God is punishing them unfairly. Alternate translation: “But you are judging God very unfairly, as the wicked do” (2) that Job is experiencing the consequences of God’s judgment against him. Alternate translation: “but God is judging you severely, as he judges the wicked”
36:17	k145		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רָשָׁ֥ע	1	Elihu is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”

He could mean: (1) that God is executing judgment against Job by punishing him. In that case, Elihu would be using **judgment** in a different sense than he did in the first part of the verse, to mean God’s judgment of Job rather than Job’s judgment of God. Alternate translation: “God is judging you strictly by punishing you” (2) that **judgment** and **justice** take hold of one another, meaning that they work together closely to show that Job is guilty. Alternate translation: “a just judgment is that you are guilty”
36:18	mp6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כִּֽי־חֵ֭מָה פֶּן־יְסִֽיתְ⁠ךָ֣	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “For there is wrath, so beware lest it entice you” or “For you are angry, so beware lest your anger entice you”
36:18	k147		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠סָ֑פֶק	1	Elihu is using the term **clapping** by association to mean derision, since the people in this culture clapped their hands in order to express derision, as [27:23](../27/23.md) and [34:37](../34/37.md) indicate.

36:18	k148		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠רָב־כֹּ֝֗פֶר אַל־יַטֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	It may be more natural in your language to express the meaning here by using a form other than a possessive form. Alternate translation: “and no ransom, no matter how great, will deliver you”
36:19	m4pr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יַעֲרֹ֣ךְ שׁ֭וּעֲ⁠ךָ	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis.

36:20	k150		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה	1	Elihu is probably using the image of **night** to mean death, similarly to the way Bildad used “darkness” to mean death in [18:18](../18/18.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “death” or “to die”
36:20	q5v5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לַ⁠עֲל֖וֹת עַמִּ֣ים תַּחְתָּֽ⁠ם	1	By **their place**, Elihu seems to mean this earth. This may be an implicit warning to Job that once he dies, he will no longer have the opportunity that people on this earth have to repent and be reconciled to God. Alternate translation: “because when people die, they leave this earth and they have no further opportunity to repent”
36:21	k151		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַל־תֵּ֣פֶן אֶל־אָ֑וֶן	1	Elihu is speaking as if **sin** were in a particular direction and Job might literally **turn** towards that direction.

36:21	qhr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠עֹֽנִי	1	Elihu is using the term **affliction** by association to mean God’s correction.

36:22	c7mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֶן־אֵ֭ל יַשְׂגִּ֣יב בְּ⁠כֹח֑⁠וֹ	1	This could mean, depending on the meaning of the rest of the sentence: (1) that Elihu is beginning his description of a gathering storm and he is calling the attention of the others who are present to the clouds that are forming in the sky. In that case, Elihu would mean the term **Behold** literally. Alternate translation: “Look, God causes to be high in his power!” (2) that while Elihu is going to use the storm to illustrate God’s power, here he is asking the others to reflect on how great God’s power is. Alternate translation: “Consider this: God causes to be high in his power”
36:22	x4qx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֶן־אֵ֭ל יַשְׂגִּ֣יב בְּ⁠כֹח֑⁠וֹ	1	Elihu could be saying: (1) that God makes **high** things, specifically in this case storm clouds, and that demonstrates his **power**. Alternate translation: “Look at what high clouds God is making in his power!” (2) that God has caused himself to be high, that is, that God has exalted himself. Alternate translation: “Consider how great God has shown himself to be”
36:22	ay6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֖י כָמֹ֣⁠הוּ מוֹרֶֽה	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis.

36:23	k152		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִֽי־פָקַ֣ד עָלָ֣י⁠ו דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is speaking of how someone conducts himself as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along.

36:24	k154		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	זְ֭כֹר	1	Elihu is using the term **Remember** in a particular sense to mean “ensure.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Ensure”
36:24	k155		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֲנָשִֽׁים	1	Here the masculine term **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

36:25	c8rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱ֝נ֗וֹשׁ יַבִּ֥יט מֵ⁠רָחֽוֹק	1	Elihu is speaking as if people have literally seen God’s work **from afar**, that is, from a distance.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation.

37:intro	ccm7				0	# Job 37 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis is the conclusion of Elihu’s speech. Elihu continues to use the storm that is gathering and approaching to describe God’s great power. He concludes by telling Job that he should not expect to be able to speak with such a powerful God.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### singular “you” in verses 15–19\n\nThe pronoun “you” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular in verses 15–19 because Elihu is addressing Job. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use singular forms in your translation.\n\n### The nature of the questions in verses 15–18\n\nElihu asks Job a series of questions in verses 15–18. He may want Job to try to answer these questions so that Job will have to admit that he does not understand what God does. So these could be actual questions that Elihu is using to get information, specifically, these admissions from Job. Alternatively, Elihu may be using the question form for emphasis. A note to verse 15 suggests two possible ways in which you could translate the question there. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in verses 15–18.

37:2	k175		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שִׁמְע֤וּ שָׁמ֣וֹעַ	1	Elihu is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses.

Alternate translation: “Oh, hear”
37:2	k176		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שִׁמְע֤וּ	1	The implied “you” in the imperative **hear** is plural because Elihu is addressing Job, his three friends, and any others who may be present and listening. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

37:5	k185		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א נֵדָֽע	1	Here the term **know** has the sense of “understand” rather than “be aware of.” Elihu is not saying that people do not realize that God is doing **great things**.

37:14	k203		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	הַאֲזִ֣ינָ⁠ה זֹּ֣את	1	Elihu is using an emphatic form of the imperative. If your language has an emphatic imperative, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Pay close attention to this”
37:14	k204		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	עֲ֝מֹ֗ד וְ⁠הִתְבּוֹנֵ֤ן	1	Elihu is expressing a single idea by using the two verbs **stand** and **consider**. In this context, the word **stand** means not to do anything else. Elihu does not want Job to stand to his feet. Alternate translation: “only consider”
37:14	k205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	נִפְלְא֬וֹת אֵֽל	1	Elihu is using the term **marvelous** (which is a participle serving as an adjective) as a noun to mean things of a certain kind. The ULT adds the word **things** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this term with a different expression. Alternate translation: “the marvels that God does”

Alternate translation: “You do not know of the placing of God upon them, and his cloud causes lightning to flash, do you?” (2) that Elihu is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Surely you do not know of the placing of God upon them, and his cloud causes lightning to flash!”
37:15	k206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	הֲ֭⁠תֵדַע	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is singular here and through verse 19 because Elihu is addressing Job directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
37:15	cbz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠שׂוּם־אֱל֣וֹהַּ עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Elihu is using this possessive form to describe God **placing** a command on the clouds (that is, giving them an order), not to describe someone placing God or God placing himself on the clouds. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “how God gives orders to the clouds”
37:15	k207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ֝⁠הוֹפִ֗יעַ א֣וֹר עֲנָנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is using the word **and** to introduce the result of God **placing** a command on the clouds.

37:15	k209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠הוֹפִ֗יעַ א֣וֹר עֲנָנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Elihu is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means clouds in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “and his clouds cause lightning to flash” or “so that lightning flashes from his clouds”
37:16	w6jd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ֭⁠תֵדַע עַל־מִפְלְשֵׂי־עָ֑ב מִ֝פְלְא֗וֹת תְּמִ֣ים דֵּעִֽים	1	See how you translated the question in the previous verse, either as a question that Elihu wanted Job to answer or one whose form Elihu was using for emphasis.
37:16	z95q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־מִפְלְשֵׂי־עָ֑ב	1	By **balancing**, Elihu seems to be referring to how clouds float in the sky. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “how God makes the cloud float in the sky”
37:16	k210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	עַל־מִפְלְשֵׂי־עָ֑ב	1	Elihu is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means clouds in general.

37:16	s2ui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מִ֝פְלְא֗וֹת תְּמִ֣ים דֵּעִֽים	1	Elihu is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation, following a semicolon: “do you know about the wonders of the perfect in knowledges”
37:16	k211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תְּמִ֣ים דֵּעִֽים	1	Elihu is using the adjective **perfect** as a noun to mean a certain person, God, whose knowledge is perfect, that is, complete and comprehensive. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “God, who is perfect in knowledges”
37:16	k212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	תְּמִ֣ים דֵּעִֽים	1	Elihu is using the plural form **knowledges** in a context where the singular term “knowledge” would suffice. This suggests that he is using the plural form for emphasis. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, it might be natural for you to use a singular form, or you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “God, who knows everything perfectly”
37:17	hy96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲשֶׁר־בְּגָדֶ֥י⁠ךָ חַמִּ֑ים	1	Elihu is using one part of Job, his **clothes**, to mean all of him in the act of being **hot**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You who sweat in your garments”
37:17	r98k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠הַשְׁקִ֥ט אֶ֝֗רֶץ מִ⁠דָּרֽוֹם	1	Elihu assumes that Job will understand that by **south** he is referring to the desert. The book of Job is set in a location where there was a desert to the south. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “when the air comes from the desert and the land is still”
37:18	c2kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תַּרְקִ֣יעַ עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ לִ⁠שְׁחָקִ֑ים	1	People in this culture believed that the sky was a solid object, a great dome that God had made and placed above the earth. Elihu is speaking as if God had literally melted metal and then hammered it flat in order to make the sky. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Would you be able to create the sky as he did”
37:18	ww4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כִּ⁠רְאִ֥י מוּצָֽק	1	A **mirror** is an object that reflects images. People look into mirrors to check their appearance. In this culture, mirrors were made of bright metal. If your readers would not be familiar with what a mirror is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable metal object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “as an object cast from metal”
37:18	k213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כִּ⁠רְאִ֥י מוּצָֽק	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as a mirror that someone has cast from metal”

Elihu seems to be using the term **we** to refer to Job as well as to himself and the others who are listening, since he is describing a general human condition. It may be natural in your language to use the inclusive form of “we” in this second instance if your language marks that distinction.
37:19	k214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	ה֭וֹדִיעֵ⁠נוּ מַה־נֹּ֣אמַר ל֑⁠וֹ	1	For emphasis, Elihu is saying the opposite of what he means.

37:19	k215		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֥א־נַ֝עֲרֹ֗ךְ	1	See how you translated the term “array” in [33:5](../33/05.md). Alternate translation: “we cannot marshal our arguments” or “we cannot organize what we want to say”
37:19	k216		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person or thing by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “because of the darkness that is present”
37:19	q3st		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Elihu is referring to the limitations of human understanding.

37:20	z1tr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַֽ⁠יְסֻפַּר־ל֭⁠וֹ כִּ֣י אֲדַבֵּ֑ר	1	Elihu is using the question form for emphasis.

37:21	k222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠תְּטַהֲרֵֽ⁠ם	1	Elihu is speaking as if the **wind** literally **cleansed** the **skies** when it drove away all the clouds.

37:22	k223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ֭⁠צָּפוֹן	1	Elihu assumes that Job will understand that by **the north** he means the abode of God. In this culture, people believed that there was a divine residence in the northern regions of the earth. You could translate this with a general expression or with a term that your readers would recognize as describing the abode of God. Alternate translation: “From God’s abode” or “From heaven”
37:22	k224		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	זָהָ֣ב יֶֽאֱתֶ֑ה	1	Elihu is using the term **gold** by association to mean golden splendor, that is, the glory of God.

37:22	l64j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	עַל־אֱ֝ל֗וֹהַּ נ֣וֹרָא הֽוֹד	1	Elihu is drawing an implicit contrast between the brightness of the sun, which people cannot look at directly, and the infinitely greater brightness of God’s glory.

38:intro	bs8p				0	# Job 38 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Yahweh’s response to Job. His response continues through chapter 41.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\nIn this chapter, Yahweh begins asking Job a series of questions in order to show that Job does not understand the workings of the created world. Yahweh asks questions about the earth in verses 4–20, with a summary challenge to Job in verse 21. Yahweh then asks questions about the sky in verses 22–38. He starts asking questions about animals and birds in verse 39; this part of his speech continues into the next chapter.\n\nThe implication is that if Job does not understand and cannot explain how God makes things work in the visible creation, he certainly does not understand and cannot explain what God is doing as he works in unseen, mysterious ways to accomplish his purposes in the lives of people and over the course of human history.\n\nWhen God comes to Job in the storm and responds to his questions, it becomes obvious that Elihu was wrong to say that God would not meet with Job. This shows God’s generosity to Job in granting him an interview as he requested, even though in the interview, God has to humble Job by demonstrating how little he actually knows.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s description of the creation\n\nIn this chapter, Yahweh describes the earth, sea, and sky according to the way the people of Job’s culture understood them. For example, in verse 16 Yahweh speaks of “springs” at the bottom of the sea that provide it with water. In verse 22, he speaks of “storehouses” in the sky where snow and hail are kept. In some parts of the chapter, these references occur within poetic images, such as the image in verses 4–6 of the earth as a building with “foundations” or the image in verses 12–13 of the dawn grasping the “edges” of the earth and shaking it. But in other places, the references do not occur within poetic images. In such places, Yahweh’s questions to Job, which demonstrate the limits of Job’s knowledge, depend for their force on these features being real, even though they do not correspond to the creation as we would describe it today. We may consider that Yahweh is using terminology that Job and the others who are listening would understand in order to communicate moral and spiritual insights to them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate these descriptions of the natural world from an ancient perspective with equivalent expressions that use terms that reflect your own culture’s perspective. Notes suggest how you might do this in various places. For example, a note to verse 16 suggests speaking of the “bottom of the sea” rather than of the “springs of the sea.”\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The nature of the questions in verses 4–41\n\nYawheh asks Job a series of questions in verses 4–41. He may want Job to try to answer these questions so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. So these could be actual questions that Yahweh is using to get information, specifically, the information from Job that he does not know the answers. Alternatively, Yahweh may be using the question form for emphasis. A note to verse 4 suggests two possible ways in which you could translate the question there. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in this chapter.
38:1	b53y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יַּֽעַן־יְהוָ֣ה אֶת־אִ֭יּוֹב מנ ה⁠סערה וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	The narrator is using the word translated **And** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for making a transition from what has already been happening in a story and introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “And when the storm that Elihu had been watching and describing finally arrived where he and the others were, Yahweh answered Job from the storm and said”
38:1	zh2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּֽעַן־יְהוָ֣ה אֶת־אִ֭יּוֹב מנ ה⁠סערה וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, the person said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And from the storm Yahweh responded to Job”
38:2	ln5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֤י זֶ֨ה ׀ מַחְשִׁ֖יךְ עֵצָ֥ה בְ⁠מִלִּ֗ין בְּֽלִי־דָֽעַת	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis as he begins his reply to Job. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have been darkening counsel by words without knowledge!”
38:2	kw1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מַחְשִׁ֖יךְ עֵצָ֥ה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if Job had literally been making **counsel** (that is, proper understanding) darker. He means that Job has been making the truth harder to understand. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “obscuring proper understanding”
38:2	lq69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠מִלִּ֗ין	1	Yahweh is using the term **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by speaking”
38:2	k231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּֽלִי־דָֽעַת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **knowledge**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “without knowing what he is talking about”
38:3	ur9i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱזָר & חֲלָצֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he literally wanted Job to **gird up** his **loins**, that is, to tuck the bottom of his robe into a belt so that he could move freely, as a soldier would do before going into battle. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “get ready for a difficult contest”
38:3	ID		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְ⁠גֶ֣בֶר	1	Yahweh is using a particular word for **man** that can, in contexts such as this one, emphasize the strength and valor of a warrior. The point of this comparison is that Job should be brave, as a solider must be when going into battle. Yahweh is not using the term **man** to suggest that men are strong and that women are weak. Alternate translation: “like a brave person” or “as a soldier would do when going into battle”
38:3	k38w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	וְ֝⁠אֶשְׁאָלְ⁠ךָ֗ וְ⁠הוֹדִיעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Yahweh is answering Job with his own words. In [13:22](../13/22.md), Job said to God (who was not visibly present at the time), “And call, and I will answer, or I will speak, and answer me.” Yahweh is telling Job that he will take the first option: He, Yahweh, will “call” (ask questions) and Job can respond. However, Yahweh says something slightly different than Job did. He says that Job can **inform** him. For emphasis, Yahweh is actually saying the opposite of what he means. He already knows everything, so he does not need Job to provide him with information that he lacks. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means for emphasis, in your translation you could indicate what Yahweh actually means. Alternate translation: “and I will question you and you can tell me what you think I do not already know”
38:4	xgy2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אֵיפֹ֣ה הָ֭יִיתָ בְּ⁠יָסְדִ⁠י־אָ֑רֶץ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this could mean: (1) that Yahweh wants Job to try to answer this question and the questions in the rest of the chapter so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. Alternate translation: “You were not there when I founded the earth, were you?” (2) that Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You were not there when I founded the earth!”
38:4	e2l4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠יָסְדִ⁠י־אָ֑רֶץ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the earth were literally a building and he had **founded** it, that is, laid a foundation for it (made a solid base on which to build it). Since this is poetry, you may wish to retain the image in your translation, using construction terms from your own culture, even if a speaker of your language would not ordinarily describe the creation of the world in this way. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when I cleared a space on which to build the earth” or “when I first started to create the earth”
38:4	k232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ֝גֵּ֗ד	1	Yahweh assumes that Job will understand that by **Declare** he means that he wants Job to declare how the foundations of the earth were laid. You could indicate that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Explain how the foundations of the earth were laid” or “Explain how I first started to create the earth”
38:4	p418		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אִם־יָדַ֥עְתָּ בִינָֽה	1	It might seem that the expression **know understanding** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “if you know” or “if you understand”
38:5	sp2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִי־שָׂ֣ם מְ֭מַדֶּי⁠הָ & א֤וֹ מִֽי־נָטָ֖ה עָלֶ֣י⁠הָ קָּֽו	1	See how you translated the question in the previous verse, either as a question that Yahweh wanted Job to answer or one whose form Yahweh was using for emphasis. Translate the rest of the questions in the chapter in the same way that you decided to translate that one.
38:5	y99g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כִּ֣י תֵדָ֑ע	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Tell me, if you know”
38:5	wjp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מִֽי־נָטָ֖ה עָלֶ֣י⁠הָ קָּֽו	1	By **line**, Yahweh means a measuring line, a long cord or rope with a standard length marked off at regular intervals. He is speaking as if someone had literally stretched such a cord over the earth to make sure that its **measurements** were exactly the ones that he had **set**. If your readers would not be familiar with what a measuring line is, if you wish to retain the poetic image in your translation, you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture. Alternatively, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “who measured it with a rod” or “who measured it to make sure that it had exactly the right dimensions”
38:6	i5wb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־מָ֭ה אֲדָנֶ֣י⁠הָ הָטְבָּ֑עוּ א֥וֹ מִֽי־יָ֝רָ֗ה אֶ֣בֶן פִּנָּתָֽ⁠הּ	1	Yahweh continues to speak as if the earth were literally a building. He here speaks as if he had **sunk** its **foundations** (that is, dug into the ground until he hit a solid surface on which to set them) and **laid its cornerstone**. As in verse 4, you may wish to retain the image in your translation, using construction terms from your own culture. Alternatively, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “How did I make sure that the earth would stay in place? How did I make sure that it would be strong and stable”
38:7	ql8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בְּ⁠רָן־יַ֭חַד כּ֣וֹכְבֵי בֹ֑קֶר וַ֝⁠יָּרִ֗יעוּ כָּל־בְּנֵ֥י אֱלֹהִֽים	1	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. The phrase **the stars of the morning** could be describing: (1) the stars at the time of their original creation. In that case, Yahweh would be speaking of the stars as if they were living things that had sung a joyful song to celebrate the glory and beauty of the creation, including that of the earth. You could retain the image in your translation, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “When I made the earth, it was in beautiful harmony with the stars” (2) the angels, in parallel with the phrase **the sons of God** in the second half of the verse. Alternate translation: “When I made the earth, the angels sang a song of celebration”
38:7	j365		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ֝⁠יָּרִ֗יעוּ כָּל־בְּנֵ֥י אֱלֹהִֽים	1	As in [1:6](../01/06.md) and [2:1](../02/01.md), the expression **sons of God** describes angelic beings. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and all the angels shouted” or, if you translated **the stars of the morning** as “the angels” in the first half of the verse: “yes, all the angels shouted”
38:7	x5id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ֝⁠יָּרִ֗יעוּ	1	The term translated **shouted** implicitly means to shout for joy. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and … shouted for joy” or “and … shouted joyfully”
38:8	x8t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יָּ֣סֶךְ בִּ⁠דְלָתַ֣יִם יָ֑ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he had literally used **doors** to keep the sea from flowing onto the land. The image is that the sea is behind a wall or dam and that these doors can be opened for flood-control purposes but are ordinarily closed to contain the water. You could retain the image in your translation, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And who held the sea back with floodgates” or “And who restrained the sea from flowing onto the land”
38:8	k233		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	בִּ⁠דְלָתַ֣יִם	1	The term **doors** is in the dual, here and in verse 10, so put the term in the dual form if your language uses that form. Other languages may have other ways of expressing the meaning. Alternate translation: “with double doors”
38:8	k234		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	בְּ֝⁠גִיח֗⁠וֹ מֵ⁠רֶ֥חֶם יֵצֵֽא	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “when it came out of the womb”
38:8	txy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ֝⁠גִיח֗⁠וֹ מֵ⁠רֶ֥חֶם יֵצֵֽא	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the sea had literally been born and come out of the **womb** of its mother. You could retain the image in your translation, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when it was born” or “when I first made it a part of the creation”
38:9	n9tt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠שׂוּמִ֣⁠י עָנָ֣ן לְבֻשׁ֑⁠וֹ וַ֝⁠עֲרָפֶ֗ל חֲתֻלָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Continuing the image of the sea being born when it was created, Yahweh is speaking as if he literally provided clouds as its **clothing** and **thick darkness** as its **swaddling bands** when it was first born. Within the context of this speech, this may be a reference to the way Yahweh has complete knowledge of and control over every element of creation. People in this culture regarded the sea as the realm of watery chaos; these images may be an assertion that God has always had the sea under his control and care. Alternate translation: “when I sheltered it and protected it as a mother would do for her newborn child”
38:9	k235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְּ⁠שׂוּמִ֣⁠י עָנָ֣ן לְבֻשׁ֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means clouds in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “when I made the clouds its clothing”
38:9	zkz3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וַ֝⁠עֲרָפֶ֗ל חֲתֻלָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	The term **swaddling bands** describes the strips of cloth in which mothers in some cultures wrap their newborn babies to help them feel secure. If your readers would not be familiar with what swaddling bands are, if you wish to retain the poetic image in your translation, you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture. Alternate translation: “and thick darkness its baby blanket”
38:10	iq3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֶשְׁבֹּ֣ר עָלָ֣י⁠ו חֻקִּ֑⁠י	1	Yahweh may be referring implicitly to the way he **broke** off the edge of the land to make a **boundary** for the sea. This could be a description of the cliffs that serve as the boundary between the land and the sea in many places. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “And I broke off the land to make a boundary for the sea” or “And at the edge of the land I made cliffs that the sea cannot flow over”
38:10	b38y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וָֽ֝⁠אָשִׂ֗ים בְּרִ֣יחַ וּ⁠דְלָתָֽיִם	1	Since Yahweh would first have made **doors** and then a **bar** to put across them to keep them shut, it may be more natural to mention the doors first. Alternate translation: “and I set doors and a bar”
38:10	hyj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וָֽ֝⁠אָשִׂ֗ים בְּרִ֣יחַ וּ⁠דְלָתָֽיִם	1	As in verse 8, Yahweh is speaking as if he had literally set up **doors** to keep the sea from flowing onto the land. See how you translated the similar expression there. Alternate translation: “and I set up floodgates to hold the sea back” or “and I restrained the sea from flowing onto the land”
38:11	ixn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וָ⁠אֹמַ֗ר עַד־פֹּ֣ה תָ֭בוֹא וְ⁠לֹ֣א תֹסִ֑יף וּ⁠פֹ֥א־יָ֝שִׁ֗ית בִּ⁠גְא֥וֹן גַּלֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “And I told the sea that it could come up to that point but not go any farther, yes, that I had established that boundary for its proud waves”
38:11	hv5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	וָ⁠אֹמַ֗ר עַד־פֹּ֣ה תָ֭בוֹא וְ⁠לֹ֣א תֹסִ֑יף וּ⁠פֹ֥א־יָ֝שִׁ֗ית בִּ⁠גְא֥וֹן גַּלֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh spoke to the sea, even though he knew that it could not hear him or understand him, in order to show in a strong way how he felt about the boundary he had established between the land and the sea in order to ensure an orderly creation. If a speaker in your language would not speak to something that could not hear or understand him, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I declared that the sea could come up to that point but not go any farther, yes, that that would be the boundary for its proud waves”
38:11	k236		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	יָ֝שִׁ֗ית	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “one has set a boundary”
38:11	k237		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָ֝שִׁ֗ית	1	The pronoun **one** could be: (1) an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “a boundary has been set” (2) a pronoun that Yahweh is using to speak of himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “I have set a boundary”
38:11	k238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בִּ⁠גְא֥וֹן גַּלֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using this possessive form to describe **waves** that are characterized by **pride**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “your proud waves”
38:11	iy3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בִּ⁠גְא֥וֹן גַּלֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking of the **waves** of the sea as if they were living things that could have **pride**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for your mighty waves”
38:12	k239		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הְֽ֭⁠מִ⁠יָּמֶי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, the lifetime of Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Ever in your lifetime”
38:12	i57a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	צִוִּ֣יתָ בֹּ֑קֶר	1	Yahweh is speaking of the **morning** as if it were a living thing that Job could have **commanded**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “have you made the day begin”
38:12	gc16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ידעתה שחר מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking of the **dawn** as if it were a living thing whose **place** Job could have shown to it. Yahweh is referring to the way that the sun rises in a slightly different place each day, making the dawn appear in a slightly different location. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Have you made the sun rise in the right place”
38:13	s9db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לֶ֭⁠אֱחֹז בְּ⁠כַנְפ֣וֹת הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠יִנָּעֲר֖וּ רְשָׁעִ֣ים מִמֶּֽ⁠נָּה	1	Yahweh is continuing to speak of the **dawn** as if it were a living thing, in this case speaking as if the dawn could take **hold** of the **edges of the earth** and shake it to make **the wicked** fall off of it. This is a reference to the way, as Job said in [24:14–15](../24/14.md), that criminals commit their crimes during the night, not during the day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that it will become light upon the earth and the wicked will stop committing crimes”
38:13	k385		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֶ֭⁠אֱחֹז בְּ⁠כַנְפ֣וֹת הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [37:3](../37/03.md), where it was also evident that people in this culture believed that the **earth** was a flat surface that had **edges**. Alternate translation: “so that it will become light all around the world”
38:13	m62q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יִנָּעֲר֖וּ רְשָׁעִ֣ים מִמֶּֽ⁠נָּה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “in order to shake the wicked from it”
38:13	k240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
38:14	k241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תִּ֭תְהַפֵּךְ & וְ֝⁠יִֽתְיַצְּב֗וּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the earth and the pronoun **they** refers to the features of the earth. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The earth is changed … and its features stand out”
38:14	m9rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	תִּ֭תְהַפֵּךְ כְּ⁠חֹ֣מֶר חוֹתָ֑ם	1	The point of this comparison is that just as plain **clay** takes on distinct features when it is pressed **under a seal**, so the features of the earth become distinct in the light of day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Its features change from indistinct to distinct, just as clay takes on distinct features when it is pressed under a seal”
38:14	k242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תִּ֭תְהַפֵּךְ	1	Yahweh means implicitly that this happens at dawn. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “When the light of day shines on it, it is changed”
38:14	k243		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּ֭תְהַפֵּךְ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The light of day changes it”
38:14	dn8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כְּמ֣וֹ לְבֽוּשׁ	1	Yahweh is using the term **garment** by association to mean the folds of a garment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “like the folds of a garment”
38:15	k244		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	מֵרְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
38:15	jfq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	וְ⁠יִמָּנַ֣ע & אוֹרָ֑⁠ם	1	For emphasis, Yahweh is saying the opposite of what he means. As Job said in [24:16–17](../24/16.md), for wicked people, day is like night (they stay at home and do not know what is going on outside) and night is like day (that is when they go out). So here Yahweh is speaking as if night were **light**, saying how wicked people see this from their perspective. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means, in your translation you could indicate what Yahweh actually means. Alternate translation: “And … their opportunity to go out and commit crimes is withheld”
38:15	w5i8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יִמָּנַ֣ע & אוֹרָ֑⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And … the day withholds their opportunity to go out and commit crimes”
38:15	k245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠זְר֥וֹעַ רָ֝מָ֗ה תִּשָּׁבֵֽר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and their high arm breaks”
38:15	e6v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠זְר֥וֹעַ רָ֝מָ֗ה תִּשָּׁבֵֽר	1	Yahweh is speaking as if each wicked person had lifted his **arm** up **high** in order to strike a vulnerable person violently with it but that the arm had then been **broken** so that the wicked person could not use it that way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they cannot commit violence against anyone”
38:16	kmu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נִבְכֵי־יָ֑ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, people in this culture believed that there were **springs** at the bottom of the **sea** that provided it with water. As the parallel statement in the second part of the verse indicates, the focus of this question is on the bottom of the sea rather than on these springs themselves. You could say that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the bottom of the sea”
38:17	k246		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֲ⁠נִגְל֣וּ לְ֭⁠ךָ שַׁעֲרֵי־מָ֑וֶת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Has anyone revealed the gates of death to you”
38:17	k247		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠נִגְל֣וּ לְ֭⁠ךָ שַׁעֲרֵי־מָ֑וֶת	1	Yahweh is using the term **death** by association to mean Sheol, the abode of the dead. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Have the gates of Sheol been revealed to you”
38:17	a7xy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠נִגְל֣וּ לְ֭⁠ךָ שַׁעֲרֵי־מָ֑וֶת	1	Yahweh is using the term **gates**, meaning the entrance into Sheol, by association to mean the ability to go freely about in Sheol. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Has anyone shown you how to get into Sheol” or “Have you been able to go about in Sheol”
38:17	g37w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠שַׁעֲרֵ֖י צַלְמָ֣וֶת תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Yahweh is using the term **deep darkness** by association to mean death and thus, in this context, the abode of the dead. So this question means basically the same thing as the first question in the verse, and you can translate it in the same way. Alternate translation: “Indeed, have you seen how to get into the abode of the dead”
38:18	k9n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	עַד־רַחֲבֵי־אָ֑רֶץ	1	Yahweh is using the plural form **breadths** in a context where the singular term “breadth” would suffice. This suggests that he is using the plural form for emphasis. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “to how very broad the earth is”
38:18	q2iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ֝גֵּ֗ד	1	See how you translated the term “Declare” in [38:4](../38/04.md). Alternate translation: “Explain how wide the earth is”
38:18	l8zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָדַ֥עְתָּ כֻלָּֽ⁠הּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the earth. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you know everything about the earth” or “you have seen all the way to the edge of the earth”
38:19	q3uk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵי־זֶ֣ה הַ֭⁠דֶּרֶךְ יִשְׁכָּן־א֑וֹר	1	As a note to [9:9](../09/09.md) explains, people in this culture believed that natural forces were kept in chambers or storerooms. Elihu said in [37:9](../37/09.md) that the storm was coming from its “chamber.” Yahweh asks Job in verse 22 of this chapter whether he has seen the “storehouses” of the snow and hail. Here Yahweh is asking similarly whether Job knows how to get to the place where **light dwells**, that is, the place where he keeps light in order to have it available for use within creation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that uses terms that reflect your own culture’s understanding of creation. Alternate translation: “Do you know where the light of day goes when it is night”
38:19	p4uw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ֝⁠חֹ֗שֶׁךְ אֵי־זֶ֥ה מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	This question means something similar to the question in the first part of the verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate it similarly. Alternate translation: “and do you know where the darkness of night goes during the day”
38:20	k248		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כִּ֣י תִ֭קָּחֶ⁠נּוּ אֶל־גְּבוּל֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠כִֽי־תָ֝בִ֗ין נְתִיב֥וֹת בֵּיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	By **it** and **its**, Yahweh is referring specifically to darkness, which he mentioned in the latter part of the previous verse, but he is using darkness to mean both darkness and light. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use plural forms in your translation. Alternate translation: “that you would take them to their territories, and that you would perceive the paths of their houses”
38:20	d9pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּ֣י תִ֭קָּחֶ⁠נּוּ אֶל־גְּבוּל֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠כִֽי־תָ֝בִ֗ין נְתִיב֥וֹת בֵּיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job would need to **perceive** how to get to the **houses** of light and darkness before he could **take** them there, so it might be more natural to reverse the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “that you would perceive the paths of their houses and take them to their territories”
38:20	tyy4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נְתִיב֥וֹת בֵּיתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking of the places where light and darkness are kept as if they were literally **houses** in which they lived and as if there were literally **paths** that led to those houses. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “how to get to where it is kept” or “how to get to where they are kept”
38:21	ca1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	יָ֭דַעְתָּ כִּי־אָ֣ז תִּוָּלֵ֑ד וּ⁠מִסְפַּ֖ר יָמֶ֣י⁠ךָ רַבִּֽים	1	For emphasis, Yahweh is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what he actually means. Alternate translation: “You must admit that you actually do not know any of these things, since you were not born then; the number of your days is not that many”
38:21	k249		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּוָּלֵ֑ד	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you were alive”
38:21	zfd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אָ֣ז	1	By **then**, Yahweh implicitly means when he created all of the things he has been describing. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “when I created all of these things”
38:21	hy8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠מִסְפַּ֖ר יָמֶ֣י⁠ךָ רַבִּֽים	1	While Job actually has lived for a certain **number** of **days**, Yahweh is probably using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, the lifetime of Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you have lived for such a long time” or “and you have had such a long lifetime”
38:22	sj2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ֭⁠בָאתָ אֶל־אֹצְר֣וֹת שָׁ֑לֶג וְ⁠אֹצְר֖וֹת בָּרָ֣ד תִּרְאֶֽה	1	People in this culture believed that natural forces were kept in chambers or storerooms. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this with an equivalent expression that uses terms that reflect your own culture’s understanding of creation. Alternate translation: “Have you traveled into the sky, where snow and hail form”
38:23	fv91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר־חָשַׂ֥כְתִּי	1	The pronoun **which** refers to both the “snow” and the “hail” that Yahweh mentioned in the previous verse, but especially to the hail, which he used to defeat his enemies in battles such as the one described in [Joshua 10:1–15](../jos/10/01.md). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I keep snow and especially hail”
38:23	k250		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠עֶת־צָ֑ר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **trouble**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for a time when people are fighting”
38:23	k251		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠י֥וֹם קְ֝רָ֗ב וּ⁠מִלְחָמָֽה	1	Yahweh is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for a time when there is battle and war”
38:23	k252		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	קְ֝רָ֗ב וּ⁠מִלְחָמָֽה	1	The terms **battle** and **war** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “great warfare”
38:24	ctg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יֵחָ֣לֶק א֑וֹר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to the place from which the light radiates”
38:24	auw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	יָפֵ֖ץ קָדִ֣ים עֲלֵי־אָֽרֶץ	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “What is the way to the place from which the east wind scatters over the earth”
38:25	ve3k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	פִלַּ֣ג לַ⁠שֶּׁ֣טֶף תְּעָלָ֑ה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if a **channel** had literally been **cut** in the sky in order to direct the **downpour** of rain to certain locations (such as the next two verses describe). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “made sure that rain would fall in certain places”
38:25	cd75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ֝⁠דֶ֗רֶךְ לַ⁠חֲזִ֥יז קֹלֽוֹת	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “or who made a way for the lightning of the thunder”
38:25	k253		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ֝⁠דֶ֗רֶךְ לַ⁠חֲזִ֥יז קֹלֽוֹת	1	Yahweh seems to be using this possessive form to mean both **lightning** and **thunder**, and he seems to be using both of them to mean the thunderstorm in which they would occur. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “or who made a way for the thunderstorm” or “or who directed the thunderstorm to the right place”
38:26	na1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אִ֑ישׁ & אָדָ֥ם	1	In both instances here, the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “people are … people”
38:27	d9vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לְ⁠הַשְׂבִּ֣יעַ	1	Yahweh is speaking of an arid region as if it were a living thing that was thirsty and that rain could **satisfy**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to water”
38:27	q9sc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	שֹׁ֭אָה וּ⁠מְשֹׁאָ֑ה	1	The terms **waste** and **desolation** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the arid desert”
38:28	geg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠יֵשׁ־לַ⁠מָּטָ֥ר אָ֑ב א֥וֹ מִי־ה֝וֹלִ֗יד אֶגְלֵי־טָֽל	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **rain** and the **dew** had an actual **father**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How does rain form? And how does dew form?”
38:29	l9y4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בֶּ֣טֶן מִ֭י יָצָ֣א הַ⁠קָּ֑רַח וּ⁠כְפֹ֥ר שָׁ֝מַיִם מִ֣י יְלָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if **ice** and **frost** had an actual mother. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Where does ice come from? And where does the frost of the skies come from?”
38:29	qu6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠כְפֹ֥ר שָׁ֝מַיִם	1	Yahweh assumes that Job will understand that by **the frost of the skies**, he means the frost that is on the ground in the morning after a cold night and that appears to have fallen from the sky, even though it is actually dew that has formed on the ground and frozen. (Yahweh is not referring to snow, which falls visibly from the sky.) You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “And the frost that appears to have fallen from the skies”
38:30	k254		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּ֭⁠אֶבֶן מַ֣יִם יִתְחַבָּ֑אוּ וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י תְ֝ה֗וֹם יִתְלַכָּֽדוּ	1	Yahweh is describing further natural phenomena that, like the ice and frost he described in the previous verse, occur when it is cold. Yahweh is suggesting that if Job is as wise as he claims, he ought to be able to explain these as well. So this is implicitly a question. You could translate it that way if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Can you explain how, in cold weather, the waters hide themselves as under stone, and the face of the deep freezes?”
38:30	iw86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כָּ֭⁠אֶבֶן	1	The point of this comparison is that just as it is not possible to see through **stone**, it is typically not possible to see through the ice that forms on top of **the waters** in the winter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “As under stone through which one cannot see”
38:30	jjp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מַ֣יִם יִתְחַבָּ֑אוּ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **waters** were living things that could **hide themselves**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the waters are hidden”

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Are you the one who keeps the stars in the Pleiades together? Would you be able to make the stars in Orion drift apart”
38:31	wb4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֽוֹ־מֹשְׁכ֖וֹת כְּסִ֣יל תְּפַתֵּֽחַ	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Or will you loose the cords of Orion”
38:32	lrw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הֲ⁠תֹצִ֣יא מַזָּר֣וֹת בְּ⁠עִתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	The word **Mazzaroth** seems to be the name of another constellation of stars, but it is no longer clear to which constellation this name applies. You could translate this as a general reference. Alternate translation: “Will you bring out the constellations in their time” or “Will you make each of the constellations appear in the sky at the right time”
38:32	x8g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ֝⁠עַ֗יִשׁ עַל־בָּנֶ֥י⁠הָ תַנְחֵֽ⁠ם	1	See how you translated the name **Bear** in [9:](../09/09.md). The term **sons** seems to apply to the stars that trail off into the sky from the main part of this constellation. Alternate translation: “Or will you make the Big Dipper and its handle appear in the right place”
38:32	a6br		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠עַ֗יִשׁ עַל־בָּנֶ֥י⁠הָ תַנְחֵֽ⁠ם	1	Yahweh is speaking of the constellation that this culture called the **Bear** as if it were a living thing that Job could have guided. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or will you position the Big Dipper and its handle properly in the sky”
38:32	k255		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָּנֶ֥י⁠הָ	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that would include both male and female young bears. Some languages may have a general term for the offspring of bears that would convey this sense. Other languages may use both the masculine and feminine forms of such a term. Alternate translation: “its cubs”
38:33	y4fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	חֻקּ֣וֹת שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	Yahweh is using this possessive form to **statutes** that apply to the **skies**, not statutes that the skies have enacted. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the statutes that govern the sky” or “how the movements of the sun, moon, and stars are regulated”
38:33	k256		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־תָּשִׂ֖ים מִשְׁטָר֣⁠וֹ בָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Although the pronoun **its** is singular, it refers to the **skies**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a plural pronoun in your translation. Alternate translation: “If you will establish their rule over the earth”
38:33	k257		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־תָּשִׂ֖ים מִשְׁטָר֣⁠וֹ בָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Yahweh is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “You are not able to establish their rule over the earth, are you”
38:33	k258		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־תָּשִׂ֖ים מִשְׁטָר֣⁠וֹ בָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **skies** literally ruled over the **earth**. He is likely referring to the way that the sun heats the earth, cloud cover cools the earth, and so forth. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Can you make what happens in the sky influence conditions on the earth”
38:34	tca5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠תָרִ֣ים & קוֹלֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking of how Job might **raise** his **voice** by association to mean how Job might shout out a command. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Will you shout a command”
38:34	k259		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לָ⁠עָ֣ב	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means clouds in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “to the clouds”
38:34	yh4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ⁠שִׁפְעַת־מַ֥יִם תְּכַסֶּֽ⁠ךָּ	1	By **waters**, Yahweh implicitly means rain. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and make heavy rain fall on you”
38:35	na4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הַֽ⁠תְשַׁלַּ֣ח בְּרָקִ֣ים וְ⁠יֵלֵ֑כוּ וְ⁠יֹאמְר֖וּ לְ⁠ךָ֣ הִנֵּֽ⁠נוּ	1	If Job actually were to command **lightning bolts**, they would first say to him, **Behold, us**, and then they would **go** to where Job was sending them. So it may be more natural to put the information about what they would say before the information that they would go. Alternate translation: “If you wanted to send out lightning bolts, would they say to you, ‘Behold, us,’ and then go where you sent them”
38:35	z4cb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יֹאמְר֖וּ לְ⁠ךָ֣ הִנֵּֽ⁠נוּ	1	The expression **Behold, us** was the way that servants in this culture responded when their masters summoned them. They were telling their masters that they were available to serve them in whatever way was needed. Your culture may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and they will say to you, ‘At your service’”
38:35	k260		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠יֹאמְר֖וּ לְ⁠ךָ֣ הִנֵּֽ⁠נוּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and they will tell you that they are at your service”
38:36	h7ay		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִי־שָׁ֭ת בַּ⁠טֻּח֣וֹת חָכְמָ֑ה א֤וֹ מִֽי־נָתַ֖ן לַ⁠שֶּׂ֣כְוִי בִינָֽה	1	The meaning of the terms translated **clouds** and **mist** is no longer clear, although these terms seem to refer to some phenomena of the skies, since that is the subject of verses 22–38. However, some versions nevertheless translate these terms as references to parts of the human body or to birds. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the terms that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use terms comparable to the ones that the ULT uses.
38:36	sfx3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מִי־שָׁ֭ת בַּ⁠טֻּח֣וֹת חָכְמָ֑ה א֤וֹ מִֽי־נָתַ֖ן לַ⁠שֶּׂ֣כְוִי בִינָֽה	1	If the terms translated **clouds** and **mist** do refer to phenomena of the skies, Yahweh is speaking of these phenomena as if they were living things that could have **wisdom** and **understanding** to know where they should form and when. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Who makes sure that clouds and mist form in the right places at the right times”
38:37	w7u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נִבְלֵ֥י שָׁ֝מַ֗יִם מִ֣י יַשְׁכִּֽיב	1	Yahweh is speaking of the clouds in the **skies** as if they were **water skins**, containers for liquid made of animals skins, like the wineskins that Elihu described in [32:19](../32/19.md). When Yahweh asks who will **tilt** these water skins, he means who will tip them over so that they pour out their contents. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or who will make the clouds pour out water onto the earth”
38:38	njw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠צֶ֣קֶת עָ֭פָר לַ⁠מּוּצָ֑ק וּ⁠רְגָבִ֥ים יְדֻבָּֽקוּ	1	Yahweh is describing how the **dust** of the ground hardens into a **mass* and how the **clods** of earth **stick together** by association to refer to a prolonged period of drought. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to water the earth when it is very dry from a long drought”
38:39	n1pj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠חַיַּ֖ת כְּפִירִ֣ים תְּמַלֵּֽא	1	Yahweh is using the term **life** by association to mean hunger, since eating is necessary to sustain life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or satisfy the hunger of her cubs”
38:39	k261		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠חַיַּ֖ת כְּפִירִ֣ים תְּמַלֵּֽא	1	Yahweh is using the word **or** to introduce what would happen as a result of what he described in the preceding phrase. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “in order to satisfy the hunger of her cubs” or “so that she can feed her cubs”
38:40	hu7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָשֹׁ֥חוּ בַ⁠מְּעוֹנ֑וֹת יֵשְׁב֖וּ	1	The pronouns **they** and **their** refer to the lioness that Yahweh described in the previous verse. It may be more natural in your language to use singular forms here. Alternate translation: “she crouches in her den, when she lies in wait”
38:40	g23n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַ⁠סֻּכָּ֣ה	1	The general term **shelter** refers implicitly to a thicket or some other place where a lioness could conceal herself. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “in a thicket”
38:41	k262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לָ⁠עֹרֵ֗ב צֵ֫יד֥⁠וֹ כִּֽי־יְ֭לָדָיו	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **raven**. He means ravens in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “food for the ravens when their children”
38:41	hc2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לָ⁠עֹרֵ֗ב צֵ֫יד֥⁠וֹ	1	A **raven** is a large bird with shiny black feathers that feeds on dead animals. If your readers would not be familiar with what a raven is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable bird in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “food for the birds”
38:41	y9ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־יְ֭לָדָיו & אֶל־אֵ֣ל יְשַׁוֵּ֑עוּ	1	Yahweh is referring to how baby birds chirp loudly and continually when they need food. He is saying that he hears this as a prayer, as if the baby birds were crying out to him for what they needed. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “when its offspring chirp loudly for food as if they were crying out to God for it”
38:41	k263		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶל־אֵ֣ל	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “to me”
38:41	nde9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִ֝תְע֗וּ לִ⁠בְלִי־אֹֽכֶל	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the baby ravens would literally **stagger**, that is, walk as if they could barely stand up. He means that they would act in a way that showed they were weak with hunger. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when they are weak with hunger”
39:intro	l9e1				0	# Job 39 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Yahweh’s response to Job.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\nIn this chapter, Yahweh continues to ask Job questions that show that Job does not understand the workings of the created world. Yahweh began to ask Job questions about animals and birds in [38:39](../38/39.md); he continues to do that in this chapter.\n\nThe implication continues to be that if Job does not understand and cannot explain how God makes things work in the visible creation, he certainly does not understand and cannot explain what God is doing as he works in unseen, mysterious ways to accomplish his purposes in the lives of people and over the course of human history.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The nature of Yahweh’s questions to Job\n\nAs in the previous chapter, Yahweh may want Job to try to answer the questions he is asking so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. Alternatively, Yahweh may be using the question form for emphasis. Consider the most appropriate way to translate each of the questions in this chapter.
39:1	m8kw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יָדַ֗עְתָּ עֵ֭ת לֶ֣דֶת יַעֲלֵי־סָ֑לַע	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this could mean: (1) that Yahweh wants Job to try to answer this question and the questions in the rest of the chapter so that Job will have to admit that he does not know the answers. Alternate translation: “You do not know the time of the bearing of the goats of the rock, do you?” (2) that Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You do not know the time of the bearing of the goats of the rock!”
39:1	k264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַעֲלֵי־סָ֑לַע	1	Yahweh is using the term **rock** by association to identify these goats by where they live. Your language may have its own name for goats of this type that identifies them by where they live. If not, you could identify them with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “mountain goats” or “wild goats” or “goats that live among the rocks”
39:1	j6ic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חֹלֵ֖ל אַיָּל֣וֹת תִּשְׁמֹֽר	1	The implication of this question is that Job would have to know when female deer were going to bear their fawns in order to be there to **watch** them give birth. So this question means basically the same thing as the first question in the verse. You could indicate this meaning in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Would you know when the does were going to give birth to their fawns so that you could be there to watch”
39:2	nrm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תְּמַלֶּ֑אנָה	1	Yahweh is referring implicitly to the **number** of **months** that the does will **fulfill** or complete before they give birth to their fawns. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they will fulfill before giving birth”
39:3	n62w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חֶבְלֵי⁠הֶ֥ם תְּשַׁלַּֽחְנָה	1	Yahweh is using the expression **labor pains** by association to mean the fawns that the does deliver after going into labor. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they deliver their children”
39:4	v8ps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְ֭נֵי⁠הֶם & לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	The pronouns **Their** and **them** are masculine, meaning that they refer to the fathers and mothers of these young deer. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Your language may similarly use masculine plural pronouns for a group of two or more subjects that includes both male and female individuals. If not, you could show the meaning by using an explanatory phrase. Alternate translation: “The sons of does and bucks … to their parents”
39:4	k265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בְ֭נֵי⁠הֶם	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that would include both male and female young deer. Some languages may have a general term for the offspring of deer that would convey this sense. Other languages may use both the masculine and feminine forms of such a term. Alternate translation: “their fawns”
39:4	wey9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בַ⁠בָּ֑ר	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **field**. He means fields in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “in the fields”
39:5	x4tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	פֶּ֣רֶא & עָ֝ר֗וֹד	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **wild donkey**. He means wild donkeys in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “the wild donkeys … these donkeys”
39:6	k266		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֣מְתִּי עֲרָבָ֣ה בֵית֑⁠וֹ וּֽ⁠מִשְׁכְּנוֹתָ֥י⁠ו מְלֵֽחָה	1	In some languages it may be more natural to mention the place first and then give the information that Yahweh had made this a place for wild donkeys to live in. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I have made the Arabah his house, yes, I have made the salt land his habitations”
39:6	qyi5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֣מְתִּי עֲרָבָ֣ה בֵית֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **Arabah** or desert were literally a **house** in which a wild donkey lived. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to whom I have given the Arabah as a place to live”
39:6	k267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּֽ⁠מִשְׁכְּנוֹתָ֥י⁠ו מְלֵֽחָה	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and whose habitations I have made in the salt land”
39:6	k268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּֽ⁠מִשְׁכְּנוֹתָ֥י⁠ו מְלֵֽחָה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **habitations**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “yes, to whom I have given the salt land as a place to inhabit”
39:6	hfq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מְלֵֽחָה	1	Yahweh is using the term **salt land** to refer by association to a particular area of the desert where there is much salt in the soil and, as a result, few plants can grow. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the barren land” or “the desert”
39:7	m4ln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִ֭שְׂחַק לַ⁠הֲמ֣וֹן קִרְיָ֑ה	1	Yahweh is speaking of the wild donkey as if it could consciously express by laughing what it was thinking and feeling. Here the term **laughs** implicitly means laughing scornfully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It prefers being in the desert to being in the city”
39:7	rpn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	תְּשֻׁא֥וֹת נ֝וֹגֵ֗שׂ לֹ֣א יִשְׁמָֽע	1	If this donkey had a **driver** who forced it to go places and do things, one thing that would happen is that the donkey would **hear** the **shouts** of the driver, that is, the commands that the driver was shouting at it. Yahweh is using this one thing to represent the entire possibility of the donkey having an owner and driver. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it has no owner who shouts at it to make it go places and do things”
39:8	t3sa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כָּל־יָר֣וֹק	1	Yahweh is using the term **green** by association to mean any green herb or plant that would grow in the desert. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “any plant that it can eat”
39:9	f9tw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הֲ⁠יֹ֣אבֶה רֵּ֣ים עָבְדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking of the **wild ox** as if it were a living thing that could **consent** to **serve** Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Would a wild ox plow your fields without balking”
39:9	t1u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־יָ֝לִ֗ין עַל־אֲבוּסֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “It would not lodge by your manger, would it”
39:9	sgz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֲבוּסֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	A **manger** was a box or frame in which people put hay or other food for animals to eat. In this culture, animals were often kept near a home to keep them safe and so that their owners could feed them easily. If your readers would not be familiar with what a manger is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “your feeding trough” or “the box in which you put food for your farm animals”
39:10	mt1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲֽ⁠תִקְשָׁר־רֵ֭ים בְּ⁠תֶ֣לֶם עֲבֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is asking implicitly whether Job could use **rope** to harness a **wild ox** to a plow that was in a **furrow**. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Can you harness a wild ox to a plow and get it to plow furrows in your field”
39:10	k269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־יְשַׂדֵּ֖ד עֲמָקִ֣ים אַחֲרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “It would not harrow the valleys after you, would it”
39:10	gny8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־יְשַׂדֵּ֖ד עֲמָקִ֣ים אַחֲרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	In this culture, farmers would lead a draft animal from the front as it pulled a harrow behind it. That is why Yahweh says **after you**. If farmers in your culture who harrow with draft animals instead walk behind the harrow, you could translate this in a way that expressed the general meaning without specifying a particular method of harrowing. Alternate translation: “Could you use it to harrow your fields in the valleys”
39:10	uq7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	יְשַׂדֵּ֖ד עֲמָקִ֣ים	1	To **harrow** means to smooth and break up soil once it has been plowed. If your readers would not be familiar with what it means to harrow a field, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “it will pull a light implement to smooth and break up the soil in your fields in the valleys”
39:11	au79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲֽ⁠תִבְטַח־בּ֭⁠וֹ כִּי־רַ֣ב כֹּח֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠תַעֲזֹ֖ב אֵלָ֣י⁠ו יְגִיעֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh means implicitly that Job or any other human being would not be able to trust a wild ox as a farm animal, because it could not be trained to do field work. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Would you really be able to trust a wild ox, because it was so strong, to do the hard part of your farm work”
39:12	ht1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠תַאֲמִ֣ין בּ֭⁠וֹ כִּי־יָשִׁ֣יב & זַרְעֶ֑⁠ךָ וְֽ⁠גָרְנְ⁠ךָ֥ יֶאֱסֹֽף	1	As in the previous verse, Yahweh means implicitly that Job or any other human being would not be able to depend on a wild ox to do the work of a farm animal. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Would you really be able to depend on it to bring in your grain from your fields to your threshing floor”
39:13	k270		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	כְּנַף־רְנָנִ֥ים נֶעֱלָ֑סָה	1	Since the word **wing** applies to many **ostriches**, it may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “The wings of ostriches flap vigorously”
39:13	k698		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּנַף־רְנָנִ֥ים נֶעֱלָ֑סָה	1	Ostriches cannot fly; this is a reference to the way they flap their wings vigorously when they run. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The wings of ostriches flap vigorously when they run”
39:13	c9hc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	רְנָנִ֥ים	1	See how you translated the expression “daughters of clamor” in [30:29](../30/29.md). Here Yahweh uses a different term for the same kind of bird.
39:13	b62x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	אִם־אֶ֝בְרָ֗ה חֲסִידָ֥ה וְ⁠נֹצָֽה	1	The terms **feather** and **plumage** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “If they are kind feathers”
39:13	y8q9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אִם־אֶ֝בְרָ֗ה חֲסִידָ֥ה וְ⁠נֹצָֽה	1	Yahweh is using one part of an ostrich, its feathers, to mean all of it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If it is a kind bird”
39:13	k271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־אֶ֝בְרָ֗ה חֲסִידָ֥ה וְ⁠נֹצָֽה	1	Yahweh is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “But it is not a kind bird, is it”
39:13	a7t4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־אֶ֝בְרָ֗ה חֲסִידָ֥ה וְ⁠נֹצָֽה	1	The word translated **kind** is also the word for another type of bird called a “stork.” The stork was given that name because it was kind to its young. So it is possible that Yahweh is comparing the ostrich directly to the stork here. Many versions of the Bible translate this verse that way. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “But it is not a bird like the stork, is it”
39:15	k272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ֭⁠תִּשְׁכַּח כִּי	1	Yahweh is speaking of an ostrich as if it could consciously **forget** than an animal might crush her eggs if she left them on the ground. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and it does this even though”
39:15	eg2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תְּזוּרֶ֑⁠הָ & תְּדוּשֶֽׁ⁠הָ	1	The pronoun **it** refers in both of these instances to the ostrich’s eggs, which Yahweh described in the previous verse. It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns for the eggs. Alternate translation: “might crush them … might trample them”
39:15	p8ek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	רֶ֣גֶל תְּזוּרֶ֑⁠הָ	1	Yahweh is using one part of an animal, its **foot**, to mean all of it in the act of stepping on the eggs of an ostrich. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “an animal might step on them”
39:16	u9gc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָּנֶ֣י⁠הָ	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that would include both male and female young ostriches. Some languages may have a general term for the offspring of birds that would convey this sense. Other languages may use both the masculine and feminine forms of such a term. Alternate translation: “its chicks”
39:16	uqn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לְ⁠רִ֖יק יְגִיעָ֣⁠הּ בְּלִי־פָֽחַד	1	Yahweh is speaking of an ostrich as if it could consciously feel **fear** that the **labor** it had expended to have offspring might be in **vain**, that is, the offspring might die, if it did not take better care of them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it does not carefully protect their lives”
39:17	jm95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הִשָּׁ֣⁠הּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ חָכְמָ֑ה וְ⁠לֹא־חָ֥לַק לָ֝֗⁠הּ בַּ⁠בִּינָֽה	1	Yahweh is speaking of an ostrich as if it could consciously **forget** any **wisdom** it might have acquired and as if it might possess **understanding**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God has not given it the instincts to take better care of its young”
39:17	c8hu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הִשָּׁ֣⁠הּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ  חָכְמָ֑ה וְ⁠לֹא־חָ֥לַק	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I have caused it to forget wisdom, and I have not given”
39:18	bd6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כָּ֭⁠עֵת בַּ⁠מָּר֣וֹם תַּמְרִ֑יא	1	Yahweh is implicitly drawing a contrast between the apparently foolish behavior of the ostrich as a mother and its impressive physical capabilities, specifically how fast and powerfully it can run. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the contrast explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, when it lifts itself on high”
39:18	k273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּ֭⁠עֵת בַּ⁠מָּר֣וֹם תַּמְרִ֑יא	1	This expression does not refer to the ostrich flying, since ostriches cannot fly. Rather, it is a reference to what an ostrich does in order to run. It stretches to its full height and spreads and flaps its wings. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, when it runs”
39:18	y8sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תִּֽשְׂחַ֥ק לַ֝⁠סּ֗וּס וּ⁠לְ⁠רֹֽכְבֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking of the ostrich as if it could consciously express by laughing what it was thinking and feeling. Here the term **laughs** implicitly means laughing scornfully. The ostrich would express scorn towards a **horse** and its **rider** because it could run faster than the horse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it can run even faster than a horse”
39:19	jg2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לַ⁠סּ֣וּס & צַוָּאר֣⁠וֹ רַעְמָֽה	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **horse**. He means horses in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “to horses … their necks with manes”
39:19	z5th		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠תַלְבִּ֖ישׁ צַוָּאר֣⁠וֹ רַעְמָֽה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **mane** of a **horse** were clothing that it wore. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Were you the one who gave horses such splendid manes”
39:20	lpb2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	הְֽ֭⁠תַרְעִישֶׁ⁠נּוּ כָּ⁠אַרְבֶּ֑ה	1	The point of this comparison is that a horse can **jump** high and gracefully, just as a **locust** can easily jump high for its size. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Are you the one who gave horses such graceful and powerful jumping ability”
39:21	gcq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַחְפְּר֣וּ בָ֭⁠עֵמֶק	1	The pronoun **They** refers to horses. Since Yahweh uses singular pronouns in the rest of this section, it may be natural in your language to use a singular form here as well. Alternate translation: “It paws in the valley” or “A horse paws in the valley”
39:21	nvw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַחְפְּר֣וּ בָ֭⁠עֵמֶק	1	Yahweh is using the term **valley** by association to mean a battleground, since at this time armies would fight against each other in valleys. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Before a battle, a horse paws the ground”
39:21	k6rc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠יָשִׂ֣ישׂ בְּ⁠כֹ֑חַ	1	Yahweh is speaking of a horse as if it could consciously **rejoice** over the **strength** that it had. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and it prances mightily”
39:22	juq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִשְׂחַ֣ק לְ֭⁠פַחַד וְ⁠לֹ֣א יֵחָ֑ת	1	Yahweh is speaking of the horse as if it could consciously express by laughing what it was thinking and feeling. Here the term **laughs** implicitly means laughing scornfully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

39:22	vse1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יִשְׂחַ֣ק לְ֭⁠פַחַד וְ⁠לֹ֣א יֵחָ֑ת	1	These two expressions mean similar things. Yahweh is using them terms together for emphasis.

39:22	uk9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יָ֝שׁ֗וּב מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חָֽרֶב	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **turn back**. Alternate translation: “and it charges forward to the face of the sword”
39:22	k274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חָֽרֶב	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person or thing by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “from the presence of the sword”
39:22	k275		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מִ⁠פְּנֵי־חָֽרֶב	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **sword**. He means swords in general and, by extension, all the weapons of an enemy army. Alternate translation: “from the weapons it encounters”
39:23	cvi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עָ֭לָי⁠ו תִּרְנֶ֣ה אַשְׁפָּ֑ה	1	A **quiver** is a container that holds arrows. At this time, quivers were typically made of leather. If your readers would not be familiar with what a quiver is, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “The container for its rider’s arrows bounces against its side”
39:23	qlj4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לַ֖הַב חֲנִ֣ית וְ⁠כִידֽוֹן	1	Yahweh is leaving some words that in many languages this sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “as does the flashing of the spear and the javelin”
39:23	q76b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	לַ֖הַב חֲנִ֣ית וְ⁠כִידֽוֹן	1	Yahweh is using this possessive form to describe a **spear** and **javelin** that are characterized by **flashing**. These may have been made of wood, but they would have had metal points that gleamed in the sunlight. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “as do the spear and javelin whose points glisten in the sunlight”
39:24	sh13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְגַמֶּא־אָ֑רֶץ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if a horse literally **swallows** the **ground** when it runs fast over it.

39:24	bkv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	בְּ⁠רַ֣עַשׁ וְ֭⁠רֹגֶז	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

39:24	kx1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּי־ק֥וֹל שׁוֹפָֽר	1	Yahweh is referring implicitly to when someone would blow a **horn** to signal that the army should advance into battle.

39:26	k279		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	נֵ֑ץ	1	A **hawk** is a bird of prey, typically with rounded wings and a long tail.

40:intro	k9mj				0	# Job 40 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of verses 1–2, 4–5, and 7–24 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n- Verses 1–2: Yahweh challenges Job to respond to what he has said so far.\n- Verses 3–5: Job replies that he has nothing to say in response.\n- Verses 6–14 Yahweh tells Job that if he wishes to judge the world as he would do, he must display power and justice in subduing wicked people.\n- Verses 15–24 Yahweh tells Job to consider a great creature named Behemoth. \n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Behemoth\n\nTo help Job continue to recognize that he occupies a small and insignificant place within creation, Yahweh describes the strength and power of one of his great creatures, Behemoth. While this animal was known in the time of Job, its exact identity is now uncertain. You may therefore wish to use the name Behemoth in your translation, spelling it the way it sounds in your language, rather than trying to specify a particular animal that Yahweh is describing. The UST models this approach.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Justice\n\nIn verse 8, Yahweh asks Job whether he wishes to decide what is right. and then in the next verse, Yahweh asks Job whether he has great power. However, Yahweh is not suggesting that might makes right. Rather, he is asking Job whether he has the might to make things right, as he then describes in verses 10–14. In verse 10, the terms ”majesty,“ ”greatness,“ ”glory,“ and ”splendor“ describe moral qualities, not simply power. See if you have terms available in your language that can convey this meaning in your translation.

40:5	k285		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַחַ֣ת דִּ֭בַּרְתִּי וְ⁠לֹ֣א אֶֽעֱנֶ֑ה וּ֝⁠שְׁתַּ֗יִם וְ⁠לֹ֣א אוֹסִֽיף	1	As Eliphaz did in [5:19](../05/19.md) and as Elihu did in [33:14](../33/14.md) and [33:29](../33/29.md), here Job is naming a number that should be sufficient to illustrate his point and then increasing that number by one for emphasis. This was a common device in Hebrew poetry, but if a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “Though I was insisting that you were wrong, I will not say that any longer”
40:5	k286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א אֶֽעֱנֶ֑ה	1	Job is implicitly using the term **answer** in the same sense that the narrator used it in verse 1 and in [34:1](../34/01.md). That is, Job means that he will not say more things in light of what he has already said and thus, in a sense, in answer to them. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but I will say nothing further”
40:6	k287		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּֽעַן־יְהוָ֣ה אֶת־אִ֭יּוֹב מנ סערה וַ⁠יֹּאמַֽר	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, the person said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “And from the storm Yahweh responded to Job”
40:7	t5gf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱזָר & חֲלָצֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated the same expression in [38:3](../38/03.md). Alternate translation: “you must continue to take part in a difficult contest”

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Do not think that you can actually annul my judgment! Do not think that you can condemn me so that you may be right!”
40:8	k290		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַ֭⁠אַף תָּפֵ֣ר מִשְׁפָּטִ֑⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Would you actually try to show that I do not judge people correctly?” or “Do not think that you can actually show that I do not judge people correctly!”
40:9	h8v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אִם־זְר֖וֹעַ כָּ⁠אֵ֥ל ׀ לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ֝⁠בְ⁠ק֗וֹל כָּמֹ֥⁠הוּ תַרְעֵֽם	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You do not have an arm such as God has! You cannot thunder with a voice as he does!”
40:9	k291		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠אִם־זְר֖וֹעַ כָּ⁠אֵ֥ל ׀ לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ֝⁠בְ⁠ק֗וֹל כָּמֹ֥⁠הוּ תַרְעֵֽם	1	God is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “Do you have an arm such as I have? Can you thunder with a voice such as I do?” or “You do not have an arm such as I have! You cannot thunder with a voice as I do!”
40:9	k292		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־זְר֖וֹעַ כָּ⁠אֵ֥ל ׀ לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	Yahweh is using the word **if** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Now you do not have an arm such as I have, do you”
40:9	zc8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אִם־זְר֖וֹעַ כָּ⁠אֵ֥ל ׀ לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	Here the **arm** of God represents his power. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Now you do not have power such as I have, do you”
40:9	bf69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠בְ⁠ק֗וֹל כָּמֹ֥⁠הוּ תַרְעֵֽם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if his own **voice** literally made the sound of **thunder**. He means that his voice is very loud, and that shows how powerful he is. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or do you have a loud and powerful voice such as I do” or “Or is it evident from the volume of your voice how powerful you are, as it is for me”
40:10	k293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	נָ֣א	1	Yahweh is using the word **Then** to indicate what Job should do if he has the kind of power that Yahweh described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “If you do, then”
40:10	tc7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עֲדֵ֥ה & גָֽא֣וֹן וָ⁠גֹ֑בַהּ וְ⁠ה֖וֹד וְ⁠הָדָ֣ר תִּלְבָּֽשׁ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he wanted Job literally to **adorn** and **clothe** himself with the qualities that he names. He means that Job ought to make it apparent that he has these qualities if he wishes to judge the world as Yahweh would do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “display your majesty and greatness; show your glory and splendor”
40:10	k294		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	גָֽא֣וֹן וָ⁠גֹ֑בַהּ וְ⁠ה֖וֹד וְ⁠הָדָ֣ר	1	The terms **majesty** and **greatness** mean similar things, and the terms **glory** and **splendor** also mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “in great majesty, and … in bright splendor”
40:11	ec11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ֭פֵץ עֶבְר֣וֹת אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if Job’s **outbursts** were objects that he could **Scatter**. Elihu used the same word for “scatter” in [37:11](../37/11.md) to describe how God made lightning bolts go to various places, so the implication seems to be that Yahweh is challenging Job to direct his righteous anger against his enemies if he has the power to do that. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Direct your righteous anger against all your enemies”
40:11	k295		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	גֵּ֝אֶ֗ה	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **proud** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The ULT adds the word **one** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “proud person”
40:11	vj9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הַשְׁפִּילֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if Job would literally **bring** an arrogant person **down** from a height to a lower place. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and humble him”
40:12	k296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	גֵּ֭אֶה	1	See how you translated the same expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “proud person”
40:12	k297		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠הֲדֹ֖ךְ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he wants Job literally to **trample** or walk all over **wicked** people if he wishes to judge the world as Yahweh would do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and punish”
40:12	k298		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
40:12	k299		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תַּחְתָּֽ⁠ם	1	As Elihu did similarly in [36:16](../36/16.md), here Yahweh is using the expression **under them** to mean at the location on which these wicked people stand. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “right where they are”
40:13	k300		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	טָמְנֵ֣⁠ם בֶּ⁠עָפָ֣ר יָ֑חַד	1	Yahweh is using the term **dust**, meaning the ground, by association to mean graves in which people are buried. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Bury them all in the ground” or “Bury them all in graves”
40:13	k301		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	טָמְנֵ֣⁠ם בֶּ⁠עָפָ֣ר יָ֑חַד	1	The implication is that Job should first judge and punish proud and wicked people, executing them for their crimes, and then bury them, if he wishes to judge the world as Yahweh would do. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Judge and execute all proud and wicked people for their crimes”
40:13	se3t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	פְּ֝נֵי⁠הֶ֗ם חֲבֹ֣שׁ בַּ⁠טָּמֽוּן	1	Yahweh is referring to a cultural practice. This could mean: (1) the action of wrapping the head separately from the rest of the body when preparing a body for burial. Yahweh would be using this action to mean the entire act of burial, and this second part of the verse would mean the same thing as the first part of the verse. Alternate translation: “bury them in the hidden place” (2) the symbolic action of covering the face of a person who was about to be executed. (There is an example of this in the Bible in [Esther 7:8](../est/07/08.md).) The face represented the person, and the fact that it could no longer be seen indicated that soon the person would no longer be alive. Yahweh would be using the covering of the face to mean the entire act of executing such criminals. Alternate translation: “execute them and put them in the hidden place”
40:13	y16q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בַּ⁠טָּמֽוּן	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **hidden** as a noun to mean a certain kind of place, the grave, into which people cannot see. The ULT adds the word **place** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “in the grave” or “in the abode of the dead”
40:14	k302		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	וְ⁠גַם־אֲנִ֥י אוֹדֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	Yahweh is using the word **And** to introduce the second part of an implied conditional statement. He means that he will **praise** Job only if Job is able to do the things he has just described. Alternate translation: “Only then would I praise you” or “If you were able to do these things, then I would praise you”
40:14	k303		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִ֥י אוֹדֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	For emphasis, Yahweh is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **praise**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I myself will praise you”
40:14	k304		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יְמִינֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Here the **right hand** represents the power and control that people have over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your power”
40:14	k305		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְמִינֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the **right hand** as a symbol of strength because in this culture, a majority of the population more naturally used that hand. Yahweh is not saying that there is anything wrong with being left-handed. Particularly if many of the people in your culture naturally use their left hands, you may wish to use an equivalent expression here that does not name a particular hand. Alternate translation: “your own hand”
40:15	k306		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִנֵּה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he wants Job to **behold** or look at an animal that is not present. Yahweh is using sight to represent attention. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “consider”
40:15	t3an		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְ֭הֵמוֹת	1	See the discussion of the name **Behemoth** in the General Notes to this chapter to decide how to represent this name in your translation.
40:15	k307		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֣יתִי עִמָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	Yahweh means that he made Behemoth just as he made Job, not that he made Behemoth at the same time when he made Job. Alternate translation: “which I myself created, just as I created you”
40:15	h3k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	חָ֝צִ֗יר כַּ⁠בָּקָ֥ר יֹאכֵֽל	1	There is an implied contrast here. This great beast has the size and strength to hunt and kill other animals; nevertheless, it lives on plants. (This may be an implicit indication that such great wild beasts remain under the restraint of Yahweh.) You may wish to indicate this contrast in your translation, in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “despite its great size and strength, it eats grass like an ox”
40:15	k308		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	חָ֝צִ֗יר	1	Yahweh is probably using one kind of plant, **grass**, to mean all kinds of green plants that animals eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “green plants”
40:16	utj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	הִנֵּה־נָ֣א כֹח֣⁠וֹ בְ⁠מָתְנָ֑י⁠ו וְ֝⁠אֹנ֗⁠וֹ בִּ⁠שְׁרִירֵ֥י בִטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is once again using the term **behold** to mean “consider.” In this instance, it may be natural in your language to translate these statements as exclamations that are calling for Job’s attention. Alternate translation: “What strength it has in its loins! What power it has in the muscles of its belly!”
40:17	t5ej		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יַחְפֹּ֣ץ זְנָב֣⁠וֹ כְמוֹ־אָ֑רֶז	1	The point of this comparison is that just as the branch of a **cedar** tree is flexible but strong, so this beast can raise its tail and hold it flexibly in the air. The ability to hold a tail upright, which older animals can no longer do, is a sign of youthful strength. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “It shows its vigor by holding up its tail as if that were a cedar branch”
40:17	k309		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	גִּידֵ֖י פַחֲדָ֣יו יְשֹׂרָֽגוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the sinews of its thighs hold tightly to one another”
40:18	g8sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עֲ֭צָמָי⁠ו אֲפִיקֵ֣י נְחוּשָׁ֑ה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the **bones** of this beast were literally **tubes of bronze**. He is using the metal bronze to represent great strength, and he likely speaks of tubes because bones are hollow. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Its bones are very strong, as if they were made of bronze”
40:18	v226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	גְּ֝רָמָ֗י⁠ו כִּ⁠מְטִ֥יל בַּרְזֶֽל	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **bars of iron** are very strong, so the **legs** of this beast are very strong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “its legs are very strong, as if they were iron bars”
40:19	c5rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	ה֭וּא רֵאשִׁ֣ית דַּרְכֵי־אֵ֑ל	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “It is the first of my ways”
40:19	k310		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ה֭וּא רֵאשִׁ֣ית דַּרְכֵי־אֵ֑ל	1	Yahweh is speaking of the things that a person has done as if those were **ways** or paths that the person had walked along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It is the first of my works”
40:19	kd2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ה֭וּא רֵאשִׁ֣ית דַּרְכֵי־אֵ֑ל	1	Yahweh is using the word **first** in a particular sense to mean “chief” or “greatest.” He does not mean that he created Behemoth before he created any other animal. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It is my greatest creature”
40:19	k311		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ה֭וּא רֵאשִׁ֣ית דַּרְכֵי־אֵ֑ל	1	Yahweh is likely using the word **first**, meaning “greatest,” as an overstatement for emphasis.

40:19	k312		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הָ֝⁠עֹשׂ⁠וֹ יַגֵּ֥שׁ חַרְבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is once again speaking about himself in the third person.

40:19	k313		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָ֝⁠עֹשׂ⁠וֹ יַגֵּ֥שׁ חַרְבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking of Behemoth as if it literally had a **sword**. The following verse suggests that he is most likely referring to the long, sharp tusks that it used to shear the plants that it ate. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “When I made it, I provided it with long, sharp tusks”
40:20	k314		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Yahweh is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why he created Behemoth with long, sharp tusks. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “I gave it tusks because”
40:20	f3ru		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ב֭וּל הָרִ֣ים יִשְׂאוּ־ל֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking of these **hills** as if they were living things that could **provide food** for Behemoth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it eats the plants that grow on the hills”
40:20	k315		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָרִ֣ים יִשְׂאוּ	1	The term **hills** likely refers in this context to the higher ground on both sides of the river in which Behemoth lives. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the higher ground on the sides of the river provides”
40:20	k316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ⁠כָל־חַיַּ֥ת הַ֝⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה יְשַֽׂחֲקוּ־שָֽׁם	1	Yahweh means implicitly that the **beasts of the field** can **play** where Behemoth is feeding because it eats plants and so it will not harm them. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and so it leaves the nearby beasts of the field peacefully alone” or “and so it does not harm any of the nearby beasts of the field”
40:21	h567		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	צֶאֱלִ֥ים	1	It is uncertain exactly what kind of **trees** Yahweh is describing here, although it is clear that they are a type that grows on riverbanks.

40:21	uth5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	קָנֶ֣ה וּ⁠בִצָּֽה	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **marsh** tells what kind of **reed** is in view. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “marsh reeds” or “the reeds of the marsh”
40:22	k317		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	יְסֻכֻּ֣⁠הוּ צֶאֱלִ֣ים צִֽלֲל֑⁠וֹ	1	If you translated the term **lotus trees** as “shade trees” in the previous verse, you could translate this verse in such a way as to avoid using the term **shade** twice. Alternate translation: “Those trees cover it with their shade”
40:22	k86u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עַרְבֵי־נָֽחַל	1	The term **willows** describes large trees that grow in damp ground.

40:23	vbe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	הֵ֤ן יַעֲשֹׁ֣ק נָ֭הָר	1	Yahweh is using the word **Behold** to introduce a conditional statement, that is, to say how Behemoth would respond if a certain thing happened.

40:23	k318		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֣א יַחְפּ֑וֹז	1	Yahweh means implicitly that Behemoth does not **tremble** with fear when rivers flood. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “it does not tremble with fear”
40:23	x8nv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יַרְדֵּ֣ן	1	Yahweh is using one specific river, the **Jordan**, to mean any river in which Behemoth might be living.

40:24	k319		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינָ֥י⁠ו יִקָּחֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Yahweh is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. This could mean: (1) that no one can capture Behemoth while it still has the use of its eyes. Alternate translation: “No one can capture it while it is watching!” or “No one can capture it without first blinding it!” (2) that no one can capture Behemoth by using something that it would see.

41:intro	et13				0	# Job 41 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the conclusion of Yahweh’s response to Job.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Leviathan\n\nIn the previous chapter, to help Job recognize what a small and insignificant place he occupied within creation, Yahweh told him to consider a great creature named Behemoth. In this chapter, for the same purpose, Yahweh tells Job to consider another great creature that he calls Leviathan.\n\nAs the General Introduction to Job explains, ancient peoples seem to have been aware of a large, fierce creature that lived in the ocean, which they called the “sea monster.” They also used the names Leviathan and Rahab to describe this creature. While it seems to have been known in the time of Job, its exact identity is uncertain today. And so it may be best to use the name Leviathan in your translation, spelling it the way it sounds in your language, rather than trying to specify a particular animal that Yahweh is describing. The UST models this approach.\n\n### Yahweh answering Job with his own words\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Yahweh alludes to Job’s opening speech, in which Job cursed the day of his birth, by using the same language that Job did. In verse 10, Yahweh speaks of awakening Leviathan, as Job did in [3:8](../03/08.md). In verse 18, Yahweh speaks of “the eyelids of the dawn,” meaning the first rays of the rising sun, as Job did in [3:9](../03/09.md). In verse 30, Yahweh speaks of a “shard,” a piece of broken pottery, such as Job took to scrape his skin, as [2:8](../02/08.md) describes. In each case, these are the only two occurrences of these words or phrases in the book. As Yahweh concludes his own speech, he is going all the way back to the beginnings of Job’s troubles and to the first concerns that he expressed in order to address everything that Job has said throughout the book. To help your readers appreciate what Yahweh is doing, you may wish to translate his expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier.

Alternate translation: “You cannot draw out Leviathan with a hook! No, you cannot tie its tongue with a rope!”
41:1	k321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	תִּמְשֹׁ֣ךְ לִוְיָתָ֣ן	1	Yahweh now wants Job to consider another one of his great creatures, Leviathan. But he does not indicate this by saying, as he did for Behemoth in [40:15](../40/15.md), “Now behold Leviathan.” Instead, he describes how difficult it would be to capture Leviathan, following upon his description of how difficult it would be to capture Behemoth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a natural way in your language to show that here Yahweh is introducing another creature that he wants Job to consider. The UST models this approach. Alternate translation: “Now I want you to consider another of my great creatures. Will you draw out Leviathan”
41:1	f9dw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	תִּמְשֹׁ֣ךְ לִוְיָתָ֣ן	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Will you draw Leviathan out of the water”
41:1	k322		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	לִוְיָתָ֣ן	1	See how you translated the name **Leviathan** in [3:8](../03/08.md).
41:1	t8j2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	תַּשְׁקִ֥יעַ לְשֹׁנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using one part of Leviathan’s mouth, its **tongue**, to mean its entire mouth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will you tie its mouth shut”
41:2	y88e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הֲ⁠תָשִׂ֣ים אַגְמ֣וֹן בְּ⁠אַפּ֑⁠וֹ וּ֝⁠בְ⁠ח֗וֹחַ תִּקּ֥וֹב לֶֽחֱי⁠וֹ	1	Since someone would first have to capture Leviathan with a **hook** before restraining it with a **rope** in its **nose**, it may be more natural to put the information about the hook first. Alternate translation: “Will you capture it by hooking its jaw and then put a rope into its nose to restrain it?”
41:2	k323		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠תָשִׂ֣ים אַגְמ֣וֹן בְּ⁠אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [40:24](../40/24.md). Alternate translation: “Will you control its movements by passing a rope through a hole in its nose”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If it could speak, it would not multiply supplications to you! If it could talk, it would not say tender things to you!”
41:3	k324		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הֲ⁠יַרְבֶּ֣ה אֵ֭לֶי⁠ךָ תַּחֲנוּנִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **supplications**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “It would not keep begging you to release it!”
41:3	k325		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־יְדַבֵּ֖ר אֵלֶ֣י⁠ךָ רַכּֽוֹת	1	Yahweh is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “It would not speak tender things to you, would it?”
41:3	k326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אִם־יְדַבֵּ֖ר אֵלֶ֣י⁠ךָ רַכּֽוֹת	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **tender** as a noun to mean a certain kind of saying. The ULT adds the word **things** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “It would not speak politely to you, would it”
41:4	lt8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יִכְרֹ֣ת בְּרִ֣ית עִמָּ֑⁠ךְ תִּ֝קָּחֶ֗⁠נּוּ לְ⁠עֶ֣בֶד עוֹלָֽם	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations.

41:4	k4da		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הֲ⁠יִכְרֹ֣ת בְּרִ֣ית עִמָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if Leviathan could intelligently make legal arrangements.

41:4	k328		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עוֹלָֽם	1	The word translated **forever** does not mean for eternity. It describes an indefinite future period. In this context, it describes becoming a **servant** without any specified term of service, that is, for life. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “for the rest of its life”

41:5	k329		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כַּ⁠צִּפּ֑וֹר	1	In this culture, a person might keep a **bird** as a pet. If someone in your culture would not do that, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “as with a pet”
41:5	kt39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠תִקְשְׁרֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	In this context, the word **tie** probably refers to putting a leash on an animal. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Or will you put a leash on it”

If they made a large catch, they would **bargain** over how much of it belonged to each of them. The word **merchants** refers to people who would buy the catch in order to resell it to their customers. The fishermen would be able to **divide** Leviathan among several merchants because it would be such a large catch. You could indicate these things in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do that.

41:10	k337		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנַ֥⁠י יִתְיַצָּֽב	1	Here the word **face** represents what is directly in front of Yahweh. Yahweh is referring to someone coming directly in front of him to attack him. Alternate translation: “who would attack me”

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will certainly speak about its limbs and the matter of its strengths and the beauty of its form”
41:12	c6dk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	גְּ֝בוּר֗וֹת	1	Yahweh is using the plural form **strengths** in a context where the singular term “strength” would suffice. This suggests that he is using the plural form for emphasis. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “its great strength”
41:13	fp4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־גִ֭לָּה פְּנֵ֣י לְבוּשׁ֑⁠וֹ בְּ⁠כֶ֥פֶל רִ֝סְנ֗⁠וֹ מִ֣י יָבֽוֹא	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis.

41:13	k340		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּנֵ֣י לְבוּשׁ֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using the term **face** in a specific sense to mean “surface.” By the surface of Leviathan’s hide, he means the scales that he describes in verses 15–17. Alternate translation: “the scales on its hide”
41:13	k341		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠כֶ֥פֶל רִ֝סְנ֗⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using this possessive form to describe a **bridle** that is characterized by being **double**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Into its double bridle”
41:13	k342		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠כֶ֥פֶל רִ֝סְנ֗⁠וֹ	1	The term **bridle** describes a type of headgear that people put on animals in order to control them. It consists of a bit that goes into the animal’s mouth and a series of straps that a rider can use to apply pressure to the bit. If your readers would not be familiar with what a bridle is, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “Into its double controlling mouthpiece”

41:15	s54h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	סָ֝ג֗וּר חוֹתָ֥ם צָֽר	1	Yahweh is speaking as if a **tight seal** literally held the scales of Leviathan closely to one another.

41:20	k352		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	כְּ⁠ד֖וּד נָפ֣וּחַ וְ⁠אַגְמֹֽן	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **reed** tells what kind of fuel the fire is burning that is heating the **pot**. People would make a fire out of dried reeds if they wanted it to burn hot quickly, although for a short time, such as to boil water. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “like a pot that is boiling over a hot fire”

The **lower millstone** needs to be especially strong and hard because it bears the weight of the upper millstone and the force of the crushing. If your readers would not be familiar with what a millstone is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “like a stone that people use to crush grain”
41:25	ygt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֵלִ֑ים	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

42:intro	g9q6				0	# Job 42 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of verses 1–6 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n- Verses 1–6: Job acknowledges that he did not have the knowledge and wisdom to challenge Yahweh’s government of the universe.\n- Verses 7–17: The author describes how Yahweh restored Job’s health and prosperity and gave him a long life.\n\n## Special concepts in This chapter\n\n### Job’s repentance\n\nThis chapter describes how Yahweh blessed Job with health, prosperity, and a long life after he repented. However, Yahweh’s blessing was not dependent upon Job’s repentance. It was dependent upon Yahweh’s grace. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])

42:3	b75d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מִ֤י זֶ֨ה ׀ מַעְלִ֥ים עֵצָ֗ה בְּֽלִ֫י דָ֥עַת	1	In the first sentence in this verse, Job is quoting what Yahweh said in [38:2](../38/02.md), at the beginning of his speech. The ULT indicates this by putting the sentence in second-level quotation marks. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You asked who this was who was concealing counsel without knowledge.”
42:3	k369		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לָ⁠כֵ֣ן	1	Job is using the word **Therefore** to introduce a conclusion that he has reached on the basis of what Yahweh said in his entire speech. Job is not using the word to introduce the reason why he has spoken without understanding. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Based on everything you have said, I now recognize that”
42:4	k370		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	שְֽׁמַֽע־נָ֭א וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֲדַבֵּ֑ר אֶ֝שְׁאָלְ⁠ךָ֗ וְ⁠הוֹדִיעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	In this verse, Job is once again quoting what Yahweh said in his speech. In [38:3](../38/03.md) and [40:7](../40/07.md), Yahweh said, “I will question you, and you will inform me.” Since Job had said in [13:22](../13/22.md) that he could choose either to ask questions first or to listen to questions first, by saying that he would question Job, Yahweh was implicitly telling Job to listen, as Job indicates in the first part of this verse. The ULT indicates that Job is quoting Yahweh by putting this verse in second-level quotation marks. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You told me to listen and you would speak; you said that you would question me and I would inform you”

He is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Before this I had only heard about you, but now I have seen you for myself”
42:6	y9x9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶמְאַ֣ס	1	By the word **despise**, Job does not mean that he hates something. He means that he thinks little of something. He could mean: (1) that he thinks little of himself, that is, he no longer believes that he can credibly declare whether God is treating anyone fairly or unfairly. Alternate translation: “I no longer believe that I understand as much as I thought I did” (2) that he now thinks little of what he said in all of his speeches. Alternate translation: “I recognize that what I said was wrong”
42:6	p13d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	עַל־עָפָ֥ר וָ⁠אֵֽפֶר	1	In this culture, people would sprinkle **dust and ashes** on themselves as a symbolic action to show that they were greatly distressed. This is what Job’s friends were doing in [2:12](../02/12.md) when they threw dust into the air so that it would land on their heads. Job was doing something similar in [2:8](../02/08.md) when he sat down in a pile of ashes. Job could be sprinkling dust and ashes from the pile on himself as he speaks these words, or he could be speaking as if he were doing that in order to describe how sincerely he is repenting. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “by sprinkling dust and ashes on myself to show how distressed I am by what I did” or “very sincerely, as if I were sprinkling dust and ashes on myself to show how distressed I am by what I did”
